        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of its inquiry into personal choice and community impacts, the Senate Economics References Committee invited submissions addressing a number of specific terms of reference. The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development made a submission addressing: "The economic and social impact of legislation, policies or Commonwealth guidelines, with particular reference to: d. bicycle helmet laws, including any impact on the health, enjoyment and finances of cyclists and non-cyclists."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In May 2016 the Committee released an interim report on bicycle helmet laws (term of reference d). This is the Australian Government's response to the interim report.

        RECOMMENDATIONS

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4.15 The committee recommends that a consistent and comprehensive national data set be established. The data set should provide nationally consistent information on cycling- related injury trends as well as cycling participation rates. The committee recommends that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        in cooperation with the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development and state and territory counterparts develop the national data set for application across all states and territories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although the Government supports the aim of developing more comprehensive data on cycling injury and cycling participation, it is not currently feasible to establish a national data set as described in Recommendation 1. This would require both on-road and off-road injury data, neither of which is currently available as a consistent national collection.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Work is underway through the National Road Safety Action Plan 2015-17 to examine and progress options to improve the measurement and reporting of non-fatal and disabling injury road crashes. A project being carried out through Austroads (the peak organisation of Australasian road transport and traffic agencies) entitled "A national approach to measuring non-fatal crash outcomes" is investigating data linkage of police-reported crash data and hospital admissions data at the national level, and is expected to run until late 2017. Further information about possible sources of road crash serious injury data and the development of a national injury monitoring system is available in Information Sheet 76, "Developing national road safety indicators for injury," published by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) in September 2016.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is known that a large proportion of cycling injuries are not reported to police, even when assistance is sought from a local doctor. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        government published a report in September 2015 to investigate linking data from police and hospital records of serious injuries called
        <i>
         Serious Injuries in NSW: reporting methodology and results
        </i>
        . This report found that 78% of serious injuries to cyclists on NSW roads who were admitted to hospital were not reported to the police. Un-matched cycling injuries are typically those which do not involve a collision with a vehicle. Given the data limitations, a significant investment would be required to establish and maintain a national data set for cycling-related injury trends to capture both on-road and off-road injuries. State and territory governments currently report cycling injuries which occur on public roads, however each jurisdiction defines injuries differently and this data cannot be aggregated. Efforts to develop a national measure of serious injuries from road crashes, through the Austroads project mentioned above, are currently a high priority for the Australian Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has recently announced funding for the Australian Trauma Registry, which will in due course provide a source of detailed information about very severely injured cyclists, both from on-road and off-road crashes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4.17 The committee recommends that the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development in cooperation with the Department of Health conduct a national assessment of mandatory bicycle helmet laws once a national data set of sufficient quality has been established. The impact of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        legislation should form an important part of the overall assessment. In addition to safety concerns, this assessment should consider the relationship between bicycle helmets and cycling participation rates, drawing on the experience of bike share schemes and other initiatives directed at improving cycling participation rates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government recognises that there is strong evidence that bicycle helmets are effective in reducing serious head and neck injuries to cyclists. Recently released research from the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        further supports the efficacy of bicycle helmet use to mitigate serious head and neck injury in a crash or fall1. A review of 40 studies found that bicycle helmet use reduces the odds of head injury, serious head injury, facial injury and fatal head injury. This research also confirmed that neck injury was rare and not attributed to wearing a bicycle helmet.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The continued application of mandatory bicycle helmet laws is a matter for the individual state and territory governments.

        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Cyclists aged 16 years and over should be exempted from the mandatory helmet road rule when riding in parks, on footpaths and shared/cycle paths and on roads with a speed limit of 50 km/hr or less.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation, recognising that there is strong evidence that bicycle helmets are effective in reducing serious head and neck injuries to cyclists. The continued application of mandatory bicycle helmet laws and any exemptions is a matter for the individual state and territory governments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee may be interested to note that the

         ACT
        </a>
        Government's Road Safety Action Plan 2016-2020 includes an action to investigate and assess the risk of allowing cycling without helmets in parks, town centres and other low speed environments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of this recommendation (and tied to the collection of a comprehensive data set), this should be accompanied by a 24 month evaluation process that includes baseline measurements and data collection so that a reliable assessment can be made which measures the effect and notes any benefits.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The continued application of mandatory bicycle helmet laws and any exemptions is a matter for the individual state and territory governments, as is the evaluation of any trials undertaken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the conclusion of this evaluation, and subject to its findings, I recommend also exempting cyclists under 16 years from an obligation to wear helmets, while making clear to parents that their responsibility to their children should include serious consideration of wearing one.

         The Committee
        </a>
        recommends that the Government, in consultation with the states and territories, should strengthen the regulatory framework of the property investment industry to bring it into line with regulations applicable to the financial investment industry. Specific areas include:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   making the regulation of property investment advice a Commonwealth responsibility (recognising that services provided by licensed real estate agents would remain under state and territory regulation);
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   inserting a definition of property investment advice into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">

        (with appropriate exceptions).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In respect of the last recommendation, the committee suggests that the independent industry-established standards setting body for financial advisers could set the educational and training requirements for property investment advisers and the code of ethics to which they would subscribe.

        The Australian Government acknowledges the 2012 report:
        <i>
         The shortage of engineering and related employment skills,
        </i>
        which was relevant at that time, given the rapid growth of infrastructure activity within the resources sector and the consequent demand for engineering based labour into this sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A number of recommendations in the 2012 report are in accordance with current Government policy, including supporting education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and improving trade commencements and completions and these are referenced in

        A. The Government will also continue to seek to support all Australian students to have the opportunity to gain the skills for high-wage, high-productivity jobs of the future as well as continue to link Australia to the best talent from overseas to meet our on-going skill needs. This support includes having higher education and vocational education and training (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
         VET
        </a>
        ) sectors that deliver quality education and skilling, and improve outcomes for students, employers and the economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is worth noting that some recommendations in this report have been overtaken by changed conditions across the Australian economy and other developments. For example, a combination of structural adjustment in manufacturing and a transitioning mining sector, from an investment phase to a production phase, has resulted in the softening of labour demand for some engineering professions and trades.1 These changed labour market arrangements confirm that shortages in engineering are cyclical and not chronic.

       <p class="italic">
        On 7 November 2011, the Senate referred issues relating to the shortage of engineering and related employment skills for inquiry. The relevant committee was asked to examine the nexus between the demand for infrastructure delivery and the shortage of appropriate engineering and related employment skills in Australia, with particular reference to:

         I seek leave to return to consideration of the President's report to the Senate on the status of government responses to parliamentary committee reports as at 30 June 2017.

         Leave granted.

         I think we should all take note of the extensive list of responses that have not been received. I particularly want to draw attention to the committee reports from the Community Affairs References Committee. There is, in fact, a whole page of reports that the government has not responded to. It says 'interim' in the list of responses received. Interim means, 'We're going to get back to you, folks', but they have not responded to the specific recommendations—for example, in
         <i>
          The effectiveness of special arrangements for the supply of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
           Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
          </a>
          (PBS) medicines to remote area Aboriginal Health Services
         </i>
         . That report was done in 2011! It's a very, very important issue. There are a number of other reports that have not been responded to:
         <i>
          The factors affecting the supply of health services and medical professionals in rural areas
         </i>
         . This is a very important report. I should note that I chaired all of these inquiries, and I can tell this chamber that the senators put an awful lot of work into these reports. But, more importantly, communities have put an awful lot of work into these inquiries. Individuals, community-based organisations, businesses, professional bodies have put an awful lot of work into these inquiries, and what does the government do? It has not bothered to respond to a large number of them.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the reports that I am frequently contacted about is
         <i>
          Prevalence of different types of speech, language and communication disorders and speech pathology services in Australia
         </i>
         . That was an extremely important report that made a large number of recommendations. Community organisations put a great deal of work into that. There are extremely important issues at stake here, but the government has not responded to this report which was tabled on 2 September 2014. Government, where is the response? Why haven't you responded? This is appalling. One report has been responded to—
         <i>
          Adequacy of existing residential care arrangements available for young people with severe physical, mental or intellectual disabilities in Australia
         </i>
         but why haven't the other reports, which are equally important, not been responded to?
        </p>
        <p>
         We have not got a response on, for example,
         <i>
          Indefinite detention of people with cognitive and psychiatric impairment in Australia
         </i>
         , which was tabled last year—more than six months ago, so the government's had ample time to look at this. Again, these are extremely important issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         <i>
          Out of home care
         </i>
         <i>
          ,
         </i>
         about children taken into care—the government has not responded to that. Again, it is outrageous that the government has not responded, particularly when you look at the ever-escalating number of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         children who are going into care. When that inquiry first started, 51 per cent of those in out-of-home care in WA were Aboriginal children. Do you know how many it is now? Fifty-four per cent. It's gone up another three per cent. Aboriginal children only make up around six per cent of the child population in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . It's gone up in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
          NT
         </a>
         as well. The government has a royal commission going on at the moment in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         , around youth detention. Maybe it should be looking at the underlying causes that these children end up in detention. We know that children going into out-of-home care have worse outcomes. There are definitely links to the justice system, yet the government has not responded to that report.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government should get its act together and respond to these community affairs reports and all the other reports that the committees spend so much time on and that the community commits so much time to, over and over again. I'm not surprised that Speech Pathology Australia is extremely disappointed—I can tell you that—that the government has not responded to that report. Likewise, other organisations are deeply offended that the government has not responded to other reports that they have put so much effort into. Please get your act together and respond to these reports and don't show such disrespect to the committees that do the work and, more importantly, to the Australians who've put so much effort into these inquiries and do it expecting the government to take it on board and to take some action.
