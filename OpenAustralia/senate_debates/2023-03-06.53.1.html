        We know there's always a healthy competition between Australia and our friends across the ditch in

        , and one such competition is shearing. Shearing is a massive sport in New Zealand, and they are very good at it. In six decades and over 460 individual

        was the first Australian winner more than 50 years. Tyron Cochrane, good on you, mate.
       </p>

        Tyron went to New Zealand with the support of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        development program based out of Dubbo, known as REDI.E, and has been honing his skills over five weeks working with a New Zealand contractor as well as competing. Before going to New Zealand, Tyron had barely ever travelled further than the 450-odd kilometres from Goodooga to Dubbo. REDI.E Deputy Chief Executive Officer Michael Cooper is rightly proud of Tyron and said that for him to qualify for the final was a major achievement, but for him to win was an absolute cherry on top.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Tyron wasn't the only winner from Team REDI.E over in New Zealand. Weilmoringle teenager Jolie Orcher came third in the junior wool handling final, and she is also a gun shearer. These two Indigenous teenagers have done us, their nation, and their communities so proud. Keep beating the Kiwis at their own game. Keep going strong for
