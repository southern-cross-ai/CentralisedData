         The question seems to assume or to make a clear implication that people do not want to invest in this country. And if that is the case, why is it we have seen private investment at the highest level as a share of the economy in 40 years? Why is that? Why have we got half a trillion dollars of investment in the resources sector pipeline, more than half of that at the advanced stage?

         I know this is good news that those opposite do not want to hear, but the reality is that the figures on investment coming into this country, even though I note that the opposition do not want—

          If the senator cares about the attractiveness of Australia as an investment destination, he should first recognise that there is more investment occurring in this country than we have seen for decades previously. It certainly is a share of the economy; we certainly have a far larger investment in the resources sector than we have ever seen. He should also perhaps walk down to the end of the chamber and have a chat to the leader of—of course you would! I know you are sensitive about this; so sensitive!

           , I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The question was about competitiveness. The question asked one thing: why has Australia slipped from 15th to 20th on the competitiveness table. It was not about investment. You should direct the minister to the question.

             According to Senator Brandis economics, investment and competiveness are completely different; they are never linked and there is nothing associated with competitiveness when people look at investment. That is clearly the position of the coalition. And I can understand why he is so sensitive and has to take a point of order when I point out the ridiculous position that the opposition are in when it comes to their position on foreign investment. We have the chest-beating up here, but it is now very quiet from the National Party mice down in the corner. They roar outside of here, but then tiptoe in after Mr Robb makes sure he pulls them into line. That is the reality,

              rankings. The economic rankings across 144 countries also measure the extent to which taxation impacts on the incentives to work and invest. Does the government believe its carbon and mining taxes might have contributed to Australia slipping from 66th in the world to 103rd in the world—out of 144 countries—under the life of the Rudd and Gillard governments?

               It is true that you have to have an eye to the effect of taxation on work and on investment. That is one of the reasons why this government is implementing an increase in the tax-free threshold, which will particularly ensure low-income Australians can receive more of every dollar they earn. That is an incentive to participation. That is ensuring that taxation instils the incentive to work. It is a good policy and it is a discredit the opposition that they are opposing it. But when—

                 Thank you. In relation to carbon pricing and mining investment, I would make the point that we have seen private investment, including in the resources sector, increase since those two policies were announced. I also would make this point, but I do not think I have got time to do so, so I will have to do it another time.

In the same global competitiveness report Australia has plunged from 66th in the world on the burden of government regulation criterion to 96th in the world. Can the minister explain how the government's promise to reduce the burden of red tape is reconciled with the fact that, in the overregulation stakes, Australia now ranks behind countries such as
