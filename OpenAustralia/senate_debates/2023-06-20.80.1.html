         The government has been clear that the referendum is about recognising Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people in the Constitution through the Voice. It's about recognition and listening: about recognising the 65,000 years of shared history and culture that we should all be very proud of and about setting up the Voice so that we can improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by making sure that they are heard. We have seen some of the best of this approach and some of the concerns raised through the debate in this chamber over the past week or so, but I think all of us, now that that bill has passed, need to proceed with the discussion about the referendum with respect and care for each other and seize the opportunity that comes from the generous Uluru Statement from the Heart about working together for a better future. That is something that the government are keen to do. We are focused on it.

             On the point of order: I also make the point that Senator Gallagher is appropriately responding within the portfolio she represents to what has been put to her. I appreciate that those opposite wish to go after people outside of this chamber, but that is actually not within her portfolio. She is responding appropriately within the portfolio she is representing.

               Thank you very much. As I was saying, the Voice is about recognition and listening. It's a moment that's bigger than politics. It's about moving the country forward together. As senators know from the debate we had over the past week, the Voice will be an advisory body. It will be made up of Aboriginal and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
                Torres Strait Islander
               </a>
               Australians, who will give advice to government on issues that affect their community. It's that simple. It's the process from years of discussion, consultation and hard work by those on the working group and others, including those involved at Uluru in 2017. It is a patient and gracious ask of Australia. We know that the Voice will help to close the gap by giving communities a say in the matters that affect them so that better policies can be made.

                  I don't want my answer to be misrepresented. I haven't seen the comments that Senator Nampijinpa Price referred to, but I have listened to Mr Mayo in the past. I have always found him an articulate and passionate advocate for the Voice. I accept that that is not a voice that Senator Nampijinpa Price agrees with, but this referendum is an opportunity to bring the country together not to divide it. It's about working together, showing each other respect, listening to Aboriginal and

                    Will the minister condemn Mr Mayo's comments, or is it true that this is not a modest proposal and instead is a divisive, harmful change to our nation's rule book?

                     I don't agree with Senator Nampijinpa Price's view on the Voice or on the process around the referendum. I categorically reject that view. I think this is an opportunity to bring the country together, to say yes to recognition, to say yes to the Voice and to unify the country, and, as the Uluru Statement from the Heart says, to say yes to a better future. It is bigger than politics. Now that that bill has passed this place this is a matter for the Australian people. It's a matter for which they deserve respect, they deserve honesty and they deserve the correct information so that when they go to cast their vote they are voting on accurate information—not misinformation that might suit the purposes of the 'no' campaign but isn't an honest reflection of what the Uluru Statement from the Heart sought or what the Voice will be.
