        I believe in a thing called love. There is no darkness in the story of Mark and Bev—a true love story. You've heard of

        ; however, this is a modern-day love story that is 87 years and 89 years old.

        Mark and Bev met in an Umina Park aged-care nursing home earlier this year. I was invited to their wedding, and I came bearing chocolates and flowers—as you should. The wedding was beautiful, with all the splendour of a wedding of those half their age. The church and chapel could not house the large number of residents attending, so the dining hall was used instead. The staff catered to the adoring couple and rolled out the red carpet for the lovely pair. Imagine a large function room adorned with rows of residents in wheelchairs and those bed chair things. Walkers lined up as far as the eye could see. A fully staffed kitchen and a few bubbles popped and shared around to celebrate. I noticed the sense of unity Mark and Bev shared. Their community gathered around them to share this special moment, and there was pure joy in the room. It was the first wedding of its kind in Umina since its inception.

        holds a special place for me. My partner, Tim, has worked for almost a decade in aged care. We know all the ins and outs; we know the good, the bad and the funny. We need to review how aged-care residents receive care. It's not working as intended. Quality of care is the most important thing. If quality of care is not given, there is no sense of community and residents like those in Umina will suffer. If we're lucky we will get old, and we'll all need quality of care. Thank you to Mark and Bev, and I wish you all the best—but go easy on the honeymoon! The celebrant, Dudley, even wanted Tim and I to get off our backsides and offered to conduct our wedding ceremony if and when we have one. And, no, that's not a proposal; I'm good in my short-term relationship.
