         [by video link] As pharmacies undertake their onboarding process for delivery of vaccines through the national vaccination program there is a process of onboarding registration and ordering of vaccines. There is a cycle of assessment of that process, of preparing the pharmacist to ensure that the appropriate training has been undertaken so that the vaccines are handled appropriately and administered as they should be. We have seen in the past circumstances where [inaudible] appropriate training and that has led to mistakes. So as part of the onboarding process the pharmacists are registered and go through a process of assessment and training. While that process is being undertaken their orders are taken from them and deliveries are processed. It does take a couple of weeks to onboard a pharmacist into the system, but that's done deliberately so that we can ensure that the vaccination process is undertaken safely and in accordance with the appropriate processes of delivery of the vaccine to the Australian community.

            [by video link] I completely reject the premise of Senator Keneally's question. It has always been part of our national plan to progressively increase the number of outlets where coronavirus vaccines are available. We started with the state clinics, the Commonwealth vaccination clinics, and then we brought on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
             GP
            </a>
            s. The plan was always to progressively bring on pharmacies as vaccine availability increased, and that's exactly what we've done. I reject the comment that we put barriers in front of pharmacies. We have progressively built the vaccine supply and the number of outlets to ensure that Australians can get access to a vaccine wherever they are around the country and to ensure that that is done safely and progressively so that we can meet our objective of providing everyone who wants a vaccine one by the end of the year.

All throughout this process we've put in place systems and measures to ensure the safe delivery and distribution of the coronavirus vaccines. They have to be managed in a particular way, with appropriate cold storage. It has been an unprecedented logistical exercise to ensure the distribution of the vaccine. We have successfully delivered the coronavirus vaccine to thousands of individual outlets across the country, and we will continue to ensure that we safely and properly get those deliveries out to—
