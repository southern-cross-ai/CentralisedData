        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        will decriminalise the possession of small amounts of the most commonly used illicit drugs. This comes after the ACT health minister reportedly boasted to a roomful of activists at Labor's national conference about how Canberra's Labor-Greens government was able to quietly but quickly decriminalise illicit drugs. Does the federal government support their ACT Labor government colleagues' plan to decriminalise hard drugs, including methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine?

         Thanks, Senator Paterson. Clearly the question you're asking is a question for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         , over which the federal government has no responsibility. I don't know why we're using the federal parliament to ask questions about a territory government and its decisions. Senator Paterson, I know it's been a while since you've been able to ask a question in your portfolio, but I would have thought there were other issues that are clearly within the province of the federal government in home affairs that would be something that we clearly have responsibility for. So, it's a little odd that the only question we're receiving in the home affairs area is on something that is the decision of the territory government.

             As I said, this is a decision that's been made by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
              ACT
             </a>
             government. I know Senator Canavan wanted to have a Senate inquiry and a private senator's bill about another decision that was made by the territory government. What we're focusing on are matters that are decisions of the federal government, including, in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
              Home Affairs
             </a>
             portfolio, strengthening our national security. That's what we're focused on, rather than the decisions that territory governments make.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
              AFP
             </a>
             are entitled to their view. But, as I said, our focus, when it comes to the Home Affairs portfolio, is ensuring that our national security is strong, ensuring that we fix up the complete mess around cybersecurity that was left by the former government. They're the issues that we're really focused on in the Home Affairs portfolio. I know Minister O'Neil has also been working closely with Minister Giles, the immigration minister, about the migration review—another issue that was a complete mess when the former government lost office. We've been tackling the backlog of visa applications, which was up to a million when we took office. They're the issues that we've been very focused on in the Home Affairs portfolio.

                    But the point remains, Senator Paterson, that the issues you're asking questions about relate to decisions that were made by the

                    government. They would be entirely appropriate questions to put to the ACT government. I know the Liberal Party does have a handful of members in the ACT assembly, and they would be questions best put to the ACT government.

                      It's interesting that the minister doesn't think the illegal importation of hard drugs internationally is a matter for the federal government. A spokesman for the Minister for

                      said in response to this issue, 'State and territory laws are a matter for those states and territories.' Is the government abrogating its responsibility for combating illicit drugs impacting our communities?

                       No, that is just absurd. Of course we are not abrogating our responsibilities. Our responsibility, as the federal government, does relate to the importation of these drugs from overseas, and we are resourcing the Australia Border Force and other agencies to do that. That is of course not what the focus of the

                       </a>
                       legislation is about. To argue that laws made by a territory government relating to the personal consumption of drugs are the same as organised crime importing large substances of drugs from overseas—to argue that they're the same thing—is complete nonsense. So, as I said, we'll keep focusing on fixing the various messes you left behind for us in the
