        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. On last night's ABC
        <i>
         7.30
        </i>
        report we heard harrowing details of what household brand
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_Top" rel="nofollow">
         Tip Top
        </a>
        are doing to the truck drivers who deliver their bread. One family of a driver who has since died of lung cancer told how one night after returning to work after having a lung removed he called in sick but was told he was under contract. So he drove until he had to give up work altogether. Sadly, he died last year. When did the minister first become aware of the conditions experienced by Tip Top drivers? And what action has the minister taken since?

         I thank Senator Sterle for the question. I have recently also seen the media in relation to

         just say the government takes the safety, as we all do, and I know you do, in particular, Senator Sterle, of all road users, including truck drivers, very seriously. That is why, as senators would be aware, we're investing $75 billion in infrastructure from 2017-18 to 2026-27, including a number of programs specifically targeting road safety.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Sterle, I would say if there are any drivers who are concerned about the safety of their vehicles, they should immediately contact the road transport authorities—

                    As I was saying, owner-drivers are covered by the Independent Contractors Act 2006 and, if they have concerns in relation to their contracts, they can also apply to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court to have a review of the contract on the grounds that the contract is harsh or unfair.

                      My first supplementary. Since the abolition of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal in April 2016, there have been 301 police reported, truck related deaths on our roads. Can the minister confirm the government's own figures show an increase of 9.4 per cent in articulated-truck crash deaths over the past year?

                       Senator Sterle, as I have already stated, all of us here take the safety of all road users, including truck drivers, very, very seriously. While obviously acknowledging every death and serious injury on our roads is shocking, it is also important to note, and you would know this, that the vast majority of crashes involving heavy trucks are actually not the fault of the truck drivers themselves. The heavy vehicle industry is a focus of work for Safe Work Australia and health and safety regulators in all jurisdictions in order to reduce the high numbers of fatalities in that industry.

I suggest to you, Mr President, that the answer today has not been directly relevant to that question.

                                  Senator Wong, I heard the minister directly address, on a number of occasions, deaths in truck accidents. I consider that to be relevant to the question as asked. Senator Cash, there are four seconds remaining.

                                      Senator Sterle, I completely reject the premise of your question. Two independent reviews, by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Jaguar Consulting, concluded that the road safety remuneration system, including the tribunal, was not required, given that there is limited evidence of a link between safety and remuneration. In fact, the PricewaterhouseCoopers review found that the orders made by the tribunal would cost the economy in excess of $2 billion over 15 years.
