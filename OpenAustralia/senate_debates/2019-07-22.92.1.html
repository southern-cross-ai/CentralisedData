            McKim

           , for that question. As I said to Senator Keneally, you also keep perpetuating a complete falsehood. There is nobody detained on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
            Manus Island
           </a>
           . There is no detention centre there. I'd also note, Senator McKim, that you were not detained in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
            Papua New Guinea
           </a>
           either in your most recent visit. Senator McKim, the very short answer is that there is nobody in detention in Manus Island. As I said to Senator Keneally, we had a very productive meeting today. Senator Cormann was there. Senator Payne was there. We had very cordial discussions with the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister and ministers on the way forward, including on Manus Island. Again, I've got nothing further to add, because what you said is a complete falsehood.

             The minister has just said she has nothing further to add, but a specific question I asked her was whether or not the Australian government has provided a timetable as requested by Mr Marape. I ask you to direct the minister to the question.

               . In fact, you mentioned the six years, and who started those six years? Who was it who actually put people in detention there in the first place? That was those opposite. Labor and the Greens. We have worked tirelessly for six years because, remember, under all of you opposite, 50,000 people came by boat and 1,200 people that we know of died a horrific death. So that was not us. We have worked tirelessly internationally and in cooperation with the

                  , no matter how much you scream in this place, no matter how disgracefully you act as a senator of this place in another country as a guest of another country, you cannot change the fact that there are no people in detention there on

                  government—and, again, that was reinforced today—to clean up your mess. Again I will say: there is nobody in detention on Manus Island. No matter how badly you behave in someone else's country, as a guest of their country, that does not change the facts as they sit. I've gone through this several times today in this chamber.

I've got to say, reading a little about your conduct, I'm a little ashamed that somebody in this chamber went to a friend's country, a neighbour's country, and acted in the way that you did, Senator McKim. That is something for your conscience, but, again, it's not something that this government or anybody else, I would hope, in this chamber would support.
