        I present a second interim report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on import restrictions on beef. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate adopt the recommendation of the report relating to an extension of time for the inquiry to 11 March 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        This issue surrounds the relaxation of the rules for the importation of beef from countries that have had bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSE" rel="nofollow">
         BSE
        </a>
        , or mad cow disease. There is no legislation or regulation that is required for this change in the rules, so it was entirely appropriate that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee embarked upon an inquiry to look more closely at those changes and the basis for those changes. One of the concerns that has arisen before the committee is the fact that there has been no import risk analysis. As we go through the inquiry, that is one of the key issues that has arisen in terms of determining the appropriateness of the changes to these laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason for extending the period of time relates to the protocols that have been developed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Australia_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Food Standards Australia New Zealand
        </a>
        . These are the only protocols that will be used as the guidelines to determine the appropriateness of the importation of this beef. The protocols were released only the day before yesterday, so it was prudent, in the view of the committee, to extend the time for the final reporting date so that there could be the appropriate scrutiny of those protocols. A hearing will take place later today with the departments, and those issues that are of concern to the committee will continue to be explored.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I say, there has not been an import risk analysis associated with this ministerial decision to change the importation rules, and, as far as we can see, to date within the protocols there is not a requirement for equivalence with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Livestock_Identification_System" rel="nofollow">
         National Livestock Identification System
        </a>
        that we have here in Australia. One would expect, at the very least, that when we are looking to import beef from other countries we would seek equivalence with the requirements we have for our own producers in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Madam Acting Deputy President, I thank you for the opportunity to make these few comments and explain to the Senate why we have required an extension of time to report. This is a very serious issue. People around Australia are questioning the process through which the government has gone to arrive at the decision to relax these rules. Given that this ministerial decision will allow importation of beef from countries that have had mad cow disease, the Australian public deserves to have proper scrutiny of the decision. Given that there is no legislation or regulation required, the Senate committee’s inquiry really has become the only avenue for the Australian people to have their voice heard on this issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will mean potentially a very serious change in what we require from countries that have had outbreaks of mad cow disease in the past. Concerns around the science have been put forward. Some say that the science is settled, but the committee is hearing as well from those who do not believe that there is a sound scientific basis to say that there is now negligible risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the process of this inquiry, we hope to ensure for the Australian people that a proper process is in place for the determination to change the rules. The committee is not convinced at this stage that there has been that proper process. As I said at the outset, there has been no import risk analysis undertaken into the importation of beef to guide and inform the minister’s decision on whether or not this is appropriate. The committee views that very seriously. We will continue to explore the evidence brought before us with the extension of time the Senate has granted us. I thank the Senate.

        Question agreed to.
