        Before asking the question, I likewise concur and associate myself with the statements made by Senator Evans and other senators in the chamber. My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. How many jobs have been lost in the Australian textile, clothing and footwear sector since the election of the Rudd Labor government? I ask that question in the context of being fully aware of the minister’s previous response to the question from Senator Ryan, noting his reference to the ABS statistics and noting in particular that his leader and the Labor Party prior to the election used the words ‘no more blame game’. I alert the minister to that comment ‘no more blame game’ and ask him to take that into account when he answers this question. I ask him to specifically refer to the number of jobs lost in the Australian textile, clothing and footwear sector since the Rudd Labor government was elected.

         I thank Senator Barnett for his question. I would take Senator Barnett’s and the opposition’s concerns about the welfare of textile workers more seriously if the opposition had actually indicated any interest whatsoever—ever—in the Australian textile industry. I would take their concerns so much more seriously if they had shown any real commitment to workers in this industry. I would take their concerns so much more seriously if they had not sought to introduce changes to the industrial relations regime in this country which sought to undermine the living conditions of textile workers in this country. I would take their concerns so much more seriously if they had just once raised the issue of the welfare of textile workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we have seen is that this government’s approach has been entirely different. We acknowledge that this is an industry that is in the process of transformation. We acknowledge that this is an industry that has highly competitive and highly innovative components to it. We acknowledge the importance of this industry, and that is why, on coming to office, we immediately established a comprehensive review into the textile, clothing and footwear industry. That is why we appointed Professor Roy Green, Dean of the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, who has completed his independent review and has provided that to the government. The government will be considering that report and responding to it in due course.

         Businesses are flourishing by transforming themselves and taking advantage of the technologies that are available at the moment. The Rudd government’s view is that this is an industry that is very much part of the 21st century industrial landscape and that is very much part of our innovation policies and our industry policies. It would be so much better if the opposition came on board with these policies rather than seeking to take opportunistic advantage of a situation which we have seen in recent times. Everyone understands the global pressures that are being faced by manufacturing in this country, but the difference we have now is a government committed to ensuring that a sustainable industry exists in this country. What we now have is a government that is committed to an innovation policy, to an industry policy aimed at ensuring that workers are able to look forward with confidence to the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we have is a major challenge facing Australian manufacturing. What we believe is that, with the right policy settings and working in partnership with industry, we can come through these challenges in a much stronger state. We propose that one should be optimistic about the future. We do not take the view of the opposition that one should talk down—

I understand that you are constrained by standing orders, Mr President, but I would invite you to remind him of the question so that he can answer it in the remaining 30 seconds.

           , on the point of order: as Senator Abetz has signalled, he is constrained by the standing orders. I would humbly submit that Senator Carr is answering the question. He is relevant to the question, and he has been answering that, as Senator Abetz correctly points out, for 3½ minutes. I would humbly ask you to rule that there is no point of order.

              , I ask a supplementary question, notwithstanding the minister’s blatant disregard for his refusal to answer my earlier question. Firstly, is the review that was referred to by Senator Carr in his answer to my first question in addition to the 130-odd reviews that have been undertaken by the Rudd Labor government since the election or is it part of that number? Secondly, is the minister aware of union calls for a crisis meeting to address the jobs in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors? Thirdly, does the government plan to put in place a short-term assistance package for the Australian textile, clothing and footwear sector, which is haemorrhaging jobs under the Rudd Labor government?
