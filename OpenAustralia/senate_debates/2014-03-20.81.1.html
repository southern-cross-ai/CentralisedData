        My question is to Senator Cormann, in his capacity as acting or temporary Assistant Treasurer. Reserve Bank Assistant Governor Malcolm Edey recently made the following comment regarding risk management to help avoid another global financial crisis:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For regulators, that means holding financial players to better standards of probity and prudence than prevailed in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was backed by comments from Charles Littrell, the executive manager of APRA, who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you show me a country where the politicians listen to bankers more than they listen to regulators, I will show you a country which is guaranteed to have a banking crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is this Liberal-National government still pursuing Senator Sinodinos's unpopular amendments to the future of financial advice legislation, supported only by the big banks in the financial services industry, by removing protection for consumers and subjecting them to more risk in financial investment?

         I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for that question. With all due respect to the senator, he is mixing up a whole series of different concepts that are actually in different buckets. Let me just make a first point. Regulators like regulating, and if you leave regulators to their own devices they will always find a way to make things more stable and more safe. In the end, it will be so safe that none of us will move. Of course, in an economy that we want to grow, it is a matter of getting the balance right. You have got to make sure that you get the balance right between sensible regulation and making sure that economic activity can continue to happen in an efficient way. Of course, the banks, our financial institutions and so on play very important roles as facilitators in the economy, and it is fair to say, in the context of the global financial crisis, that the banking sector and the financial services sector in Australia actually performed very well.

           Our commitment in relation to financial services is to ensure that we get the balance right between appropriate levels of consumer protection and making sure that access to high-quality financial advice remains available and affordable. We said in opposition that Labor went too far and imposed too much costly red tape, pushing up the cost of doing business and pushing up the cost of advice for consumers, which led to increased concentration and lessening of competition in the financial services sector. These are all things that are not in the public interest. We are restoring some balance in the regulatory arrangements for the financial services—

                Again, Senator Whish-Wilson is mixing up a whole series of different concepts here. Let me make the general point up front that the most stringent regulation is not going to eliminate criminal or fraudulent activity across Australia. You cannot regulate for a perfect world. If you are going to try to regulate for a perfect world, nobody is going to do anything. The second point I would make is that, for example, the so-called opt-in requirement legislated by Labor, forcing people to re-sign contracts on a regular basis with their financial advisers, would have done nothing to prevent the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Financial" rel="nofollow">
                 Storm Financial
                </a>
                collapse. Storm Financial clients were actively engaged with their financial services provider but they were getting bad, inappropriate advice. The costly imposition of additional red tape on business and additional red tape on consumers, leading to increased concentration in the financial services market, would not actually improve the situation. Change is only good when it makes things better.
