         I thank Senator Marshall for his question and his continuing interest in the education of Victorian students. Education of course is the first priority of a Labor government because it is critical to the future of this nation. We believe that schools are the gateways to a richer and a fairer society, a society whereby one's income or one's postcode should not determine one's future, unlike those opposite who promote the idea that education does not matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         I read their recent utterances, their directions, their so-called values for policy priorities—and what do we find? At priority No. 17 we find education—No. 17, that is their priority! They have the view of those who hide in the deep, dark recesses of ignorance. That is what they wish to peddle. We saw today that there is a senator here who has yet to turn on the computer and who thinks that this is a path to a modern world. We see nothing in their statement about the $2.8 billion cuts that they propose to make to education. We know that their namesakes in Victoria under Mr Baillieu are cutting half a billion dollars from the Victorian education budget.

            That is a confession—he has not turned on a computer! That is what I like—modernity in the Liberal Party! The people of this country know the value of education and that is why this government is committed to genuine funding reform. Our record is absolutely clear. We have doubled the investment in education and we have modernised every school facility.

               Jeff Kennett

              on learner permits. He stumbles from embarrassment to embarrassment, and we see in the newspapers day after day yet another embarrassment. The latest action is to take schoolteachers to court. He promised them that they were going to be the best-paid in the country and he thinks the way to achieve that is by suing them in courts.

              If you look at what is happening, the most vulnerable schools are actually losing direct government support. Take Kunai College in Eastern Victoria, for instance. Almost 40 per cent of the parents cannot afford the annual fee of $280.

                 Well may we question the commitment of Tories around this country to education. We know that Victorians are doing this very much today. The average Victorian school is starting this year with a $10,000 cut as a result of a reduction in education funding. Mr Baillieu has taken away $300 from the School Start Bonus. He has cut free schoolbook distribution programs. He has cut literacy tutors. He has even cut the Free Fruit Friday program. Students will notice all of these things and, given that, you have got to ask the question: can we reach agreement with state governments that behave like that? We have faith that they will see the light, that they will come round and understand. That is why we say that if you want to actually join with us in a new partnership agreements—
