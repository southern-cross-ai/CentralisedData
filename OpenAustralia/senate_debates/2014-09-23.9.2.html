        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. I refer to the government's decision not to renew the National Partnership Agreement on Indigenous Early Childhood Development and to the 38 child and family care centres across the country that now, sadly, face closure. Is the minister aware that for some communities, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halls_Creek" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and

         Fitzroy Crossing
        </a>
        , these centres are the only local child and family care centres? Minister, where will these families go?

         The direct answer to your question is they are going to continue to go to these family and children centres because they are staying open. They are not going anywhere. The children will continue to attend those centres. I have to say as I move around those centres that they are excellent centres, and I commend the previous government for the building of those centres.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I move around the centres, they seem a bit curious when they ask me: 'Why didn't the previous government actually, when they put this agreement in place, take care of future funding arrangements? Why didn't they put in place something in forward estimates that actually dealt with some of those matters?' But, by and large, we have 38 family and children centres that were provided for. It cost almost $300 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I move around the country, I have to say the vast majority of these centres are doing extremely well. There are some anomalies to that in terms of the feedback that I have had from some of them. They are run effectively, and this was part of a national agreement that they would be the responsibility of the states. They were handed out to the states and territories, and the states and territories would continue to fund them. That was actually a national agreement. That was the entire agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, as I said, the children will continue to attend these centres, and they are going to get access to a whole suite of state, territory and Commonwealth services.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, I will ask you once again. How will these centres—particularly Baya Gawiy in Fitzroy—continue to operate without the $950,000 that the federal government previously committed to their operating costs?

           I very much hate to spoil your day. The $950,000 was provided to four places. It was provided by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australian
           </a>
           government, not the federal government, and the federal government quite reasonably said to each of the states and territories, 'If you have an underspend in this area, come and talk to us.' Fundamentally we said: 'If you have an underspend, you can do what you like with it. We would really like it if you actually spent it in that area.' Some had an underspend; some did not. I understand the Western Australian government hypothecated their underspend into assisting some of those family community centres. But it is certainly not an issue for the Commonwealth government.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Once again: $950,000 was committed. There is no commitment from the federal government of any ongoing assistance, financial or otherwise. Can the minister please clear up for this house how the heck they can continue to operate without the important funding coming from the federal government that you have ceased?

                       Of the 38 centres, none of them received any funding from the Commonwealth, either in this government or in the previous government, for administrative processes. They all make them and do very well from ensuring that there is an administrative aspect as part of the processes that they deliver in services. That is exactly how they will continue to be funded.
