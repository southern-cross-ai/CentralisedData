         No, I don't. I have to say it's really disappointing that Senator Siewert comes in here and uses parliamentary privilege, in a sense, to make those sorts of accusations. Quite frankly, it's outrageous that a member of the health profession in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         would actually express those sorts of views himself. Purely and simply, it's a cheap opportunity to score some political points.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said yesterday, the Doherty modelling does contemplate the vaccination of children, albeit at a later date—

        </p>
        <p>
         in accordance, Senator Keneally, with the health advice. You can be as pious as you like about this, but we're operating in this country under health advice. Our vaccination program in this country has been based on the advice from and full approval of vaccines through the TGA, whereas in the US they only got full approval for their vaccinations this week. We made sure, in this country, that the Australian community had confidence in the vaccination rollout, and the vaccines that we were using, by undertaking a full vaccination program through the TGA and providing advice to the Australian community through ATAGI.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the Greens to come in here with a quote from a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         or a specialist in Western Australia, in an attempt to make cheap political points, to undermine public confidence in the vaccination rollout, I think is an absolute disgrace.

           Yes, I certainly do. Do you admit that, if we loosen restrictions when effectively only 56 per cent of our total population are vaccinated, there is going to be a death rate among our children that, in fact, no parent will accept?

                  as irresponsible. Attempting to frighten parents with respect to the impacts of COVID-19 on children is, quite frankly, outrageous. There's no question that there are risks to children from COVID-19, but let's look at the statistics. I have to say, I think it's outrageous that they're trying to undermine the work of the Doherty institute and all of the other institutions that have participated in this. The hospitalisation rate for children is about two per cent. For those over the age of 70, it's 40 to 70 per cent. There is a big difference.

                     The vaccination of children is clearly a part of the national vaccination programs. We continue to operate the vaccination rollout based on the health advice. The ATAGI advice with respect to vaccination of children is expected to be available for national cabinet this week. The Doherty institute has said that the 70 and 80 per cent numbers don't change with respect to the vaccination of children and the including of children in the targets. National cabinet—not the Liberal Party, not the Labor Party, not the Greens—has commissioned the Doherty institute to do this work. Liberal governments and Labor governments across the country—

                           Thank you to Senator Scarr for his question. Australia's COVID-19 vaccination rollout continues to expand. To date more than 17.7 million doses have been administered to Australians across the country. I'm pleased to report that first-dose vaccinations for our residential-care workforce, who are looking after our most vulnerable, are at 76 per cent today. I want to thank all the carers, nurses and in fact all those who work in aged care for turning out to get a vaccine. I urge those who haven't had their vaccine yet to take up that opportunity by 17 September. The

                           has been working with each residential aged-care facility to ensure plans are in place to provide support where needed, to ensure every residential aged-care worker has access to a vaccine prior to 17 September. National cabinet agreed that the COVID-19 vaccination of residential aged-care workers will become mandatory by this date. That is when residential aged-care workers must have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. We encourage aged-care providers to keep supporting their workforce. There are a number of channels open to support them to do that, including the government's in-reach services, vaccinating their own staff, and using Commonwealth and state vaccination clinics and

                                 As the Prime Minister has said, the national plan that we've developed, and agreed, is our pathway to living with this virus. That is our goal: to live with this virus not to live in fear of it. When we reach vaccination levels of 70 and 80 per cent, we can look at easing restrictions and lockdowns and reopening borders—first state borders and, in time, national borders. The national plan is our deal with all Australians. The sacrifices they make now will get them to the next step—because if not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent then when? We should not delay reopening. We should prepare for it and we should move forward together. There is a plan out, and we are moving forward with that plan.

                                   As I've said a number of times in this chamber, the Australian government is conducting the vaccine rollout based on the health advice to us from the TGA and ATAGI. It is worth noting that the vaccines that we are using in this country have been the subject of four approval processes by the TGA.

                                   only got full approval of the use of Pfizer vaccine in the US this week, so they have been operating under an emergency approval process.

                                   We unapologetically continue to work in conjunction with the health advice to make sure we retain a high level of confidence in the vaccines we are rolling out and have the best available data available to support the vaccination rollout across the country. We don't apologise for that. As I have indicated to the chamber already, we have received and implemented advice for the vaccination of children with a certain number of health conditions. That process has commenced and we expect to receive very soon advice from ATAGI in respect of the vaccination of other children in the 12 to 15 age group. We unapologetically continue to work in conjunction with the health advice from our health professionals and experts, the registration processes through the TGA and the advice from ATAGI in support of our vaccination rollout.

                                      is that the advice they are working on currently sits very closely to the advice that we are operating from in respect of children with specific health deficiencies. With respect to the specifics of the senator's question, I don't have any particular research with me in relation to long COVID. I'm very happy to see what advice I can receive from my health department because I know that our officials are in very regular contact with similar organisations around the world so that they can understand not only the implications of the virus on various cohorts within the population but also what they are doing with respect to the vaccination rollout and how they are applying the vaccine to various parts of their community. So we can—

He did cover that as well as other matters, so he was being directly relevant. I'm assuming he has concluded his answer, so I will call you to ask a final supplementary question.

                                           I don't accept the premise of the question because I don't accept that children will remain unprotected. Vaccinating the rest of the population does in itself provide a level of protection to the rest of the population that hasn't been vaccinated because it actually limits the transmission of the disease. That's the point of having the targets. So we will continue to follow the health advice with respect to the application of vaccines to the Australian community. And as I've said on a number of occasions today, the advice from ATAGI with respect to the availability of COVID-19 vaccinations to children between the ages of 12 and 15 will be available to the government and to the Australian community very soon.
