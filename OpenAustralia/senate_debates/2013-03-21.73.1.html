        , my question is to Senator Conroy, the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Yesterday I asked a series of questions in relation to a $265 million funding announcement back in October last year to support the Riverland and other river communities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . I am grateful for the written response that I received earlier today from the minister. Further to that response, does the government acknowledge that this fund needs to be tailored for the region for which it is allocated—namely, river communities in South Australia—and that, of necessity, funding criteria should consider the early adoption of water-saving technologies by

         I thank Senator Xenophon for his question. As the senator indicated, he asked a number of questions yesterday. Minister Burke has supplied me with the following information.

In accordance with this agreement, South Australia was required to submit by 21 December 2012 a draft business case that met milestone requirements specified in the business case funding agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 21 December 2012 the Commonwealth received for discussion purposes part of what was described by

         officials as a preliminary draft business case for the $180 million River Murray Improvement Program, with further material provided by South Australia on 10 and 17 January 2013. Further detail was sought from South Australia. Discussions on requirements continued between South Australia and Commonwealth officials during January and February 2013. South Australia submitted a partial draft business case to the Commonwealth on 28 February 2013, with other material provided on 1 March 2013.

            with feedback on the draft business case on 14 March. South Australia is continuing to develop the business case. These are significant projects that need a large amount of detail, including governance arrangements. Negotiation on such projects can take time, and once a final business case is submitted for the RMIP, Commonwealth due diligence assessment will be conducted. Following due diligence assessment, a recommendation will be provided to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, including on any conditions required for the program to proceed if approved. If approved, a funding agreement will be put in place with the

             , I ask a supplementary question. Given that $240 million of this fund is meant to return 40 gigalitres of water to the environment, will the Commonwealth be as innovative with the rules governing the fund as they are in asking river communities in

              South Australia
             </a>
             to be innovative in their approach to optimising water use? For instance, will funding be allocated to projects that assist economies of scale and new tertiary processing facilities?
