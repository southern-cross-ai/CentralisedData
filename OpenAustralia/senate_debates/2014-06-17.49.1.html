        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services, Senator Fifield. During budget estimates, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        were unable to clearly explain some of the measures associated with the scheme to condemn people under 30 to a period of six months of no income support. Can the minister please confirm whether a member of a couple who are both unemployed and under the age of 30, with a child or children, could be denied income support? Could a pregnant woman under the age of 30 be denied income support more than six weeks before her due date? If so, what impact does the government consider this crippling poverty will have on the wellbeing of those families and their children?

         I think it is important to recognise that there are some important exemptions in what we refer to as the earn or learn requirements that we are introducing for people under the age of 30. I will take the chamber through those. If an individual has a partial capacity to work less than 30 hours per week, they will be exempt. If a single parent is receiving family tax benefit for a child, they will be exempt. If they are in full-time education they will be exempt. If they are an apprentice they will be exempt. If they are a principal carer parent they will be exempt. If they are a stream 3 or stream 4 job seeker, or remote jobs and community program equivalent under current employment services arrangements, they will be exempt. Also, if someone is eligible for disability employment services they will be exempt. These are important exemptions which I think have not been given adequate ventilation in the post-budget period, so I think this is a good opportunity to highlight the fact that there are exemptions. The objective is to help those people who do have the capacity to work—

            I think we always have to be very careful when we are relating specific examples—what you might call 'individual cameos'. Obviously there can be a range of variables. We are talking about a range of variables which you would need to know in order to give a definitive answer to a question about an individual circumstance.

             , I ask a supplementary question. I think I can take from that answer that, yes, pregnant women and families will be caught up under that measure. Can the minister confirm that people who have been denied income payments on the so-called Newstart nil payment will be required to apply for 40 jobs per month? How will they do this on no income—i.e., how will they be able to afford the phone calls—and what penalty will apply if they do not apply for 40 jobs per month?

              We are introducing the Newstart changes, which come into effect from 1 January 2015, so that young people on unemployment benefits can be encouraged to earn or learn. That is the objective. We want to do whatever we can to help put people in a situation where they can find a job. People below the age of 30 are, we think, in a much better position to connect with the labour market. We all know that the longer someone is out of work the harder it is for them to get into work. We make no apology for the fact that we will be requiring people to undertake job interviews. We make no apology for the fact that we will be requiring people to directly seek to engage with employers. They will be required to do whatever they can to seek employment. We do not think that is a bad thing; we think that is a good thing.

               , I ask a further supplementary question. We are aware that the government has committed around $229 million for emergency relief—an indication that this policy will have devastating consequences on young people. Could the minister confirm some of the details which were unable to be confirmed during estimates? For example, what are the provisions around that emergency relief, and will it include or involve food vouchers to young people under 30?

                It is true that the government will be providing an additional $229 million for job seekers for help and emergency assistance under the stronger participation incentives for job seekers under 30. That is the case, but it is important to emphasise that that is a figure over four years. We make no apology for the fact that we have a safety net and that we are adding to that safety net. There may be people who require additional support, for whom circumstances are not working. I have already outlined the extensive exemptions that we have from the arrangements that were announced on budget night, but we do not apologise for the fact that we are providing $229 million over four years to make sure that no-one falls through the gaps without support from the government.

Is the minister aware that regional universities, including Newcastle university's vice-chancellor, Professor Caroline McMillen, have said that the proposed changes to university funding will benefit elite universities at the expense of institutions that attract students from poor, disadvantaged and regional backgrounds? Can the minister inform the Senate if any vice-chancellor of a regional university supports the government's extreme higher education policies?

                  I thank Senator Carr for the question and for continuing the very constructive conversation we had over these matters during the estimates period. He is, as you know, always so very constructive in the estimates environment and this occasion was no different. I am sure my colleagues and Senator Back, who was chairing the committee, will agree with me on that matter. As we discussed extensively at estimates, the government's policies in relation to the changing of arrangements around higher education are designed to do a number of things; most importantly though, they are designed to ensure that Australia will be internationally competitive in the higher education space.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The policies are designed to ensure that students from areas such as those to which Senator Carr has referred through a number of mechanisms, including the sub-bachelor degree funding expansion and including support for institutions that provide those sorts of qualifications that are directed at students who may come from areas in Australia where it is not always easy to win or achieve on your first effort in a bachelor degree—exactly the sorts of students that Senator Carr was talking about. It is about spreading opportunity across Australia for students; it is about making sure that there are many more opportunities. And I think I have said in the chamber before—

                   , I rise on a point of order: relevance. It was a very specific question about whether any vice-chancellor of a regional university supports the government's policy. I have now given quite a long time to have that question answered but we have not had that answer. Could I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the specific question.

                      , I rise to ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister, who cannot find one vice-chancellor that supports the package now. Why is the government cutting funding to courses that would see fees for a degree in agricultural science increase by over 48 per cent while negotiating trade agreements that require an increase in agricultural production?

                        I thank Senator Carr for his supplementary question. If we do again go back to estimates—and a number of us were there for an extended period of time—the sorts of figures that Senator Carr is using and was using on that occasion were addressed by senior officers of the department, including the secretary, to explain why they were not necessarily an accurate representation of the position that Senator Carr is putting. That explanation was extremely detailed. It is on the
                        <i>
                         Hansard
                        </i>
                        from the estimates period, and I personally, as did my colleagues, valued the effort put in by the senior officers to explain those particular issues.

                       <p>
                        We actually believe in the transformational power of higher education. We actually believe that in pursuing these reforms we will be able to provide around $37 billion in funding to higher education institutions over the next four financial years. We think that is an important contribution and we do not resile from that.

                         , I rise to ask a further supplementary question. Given that a university degree in agricultural science may well increase by 48 per cent, has the minister spoken with members of the Nationals or indeed had any consultation with the Minister for Agriculture given the deritorious impact the government proposals will have for higher education for regional universities and for regional students?

                                   One of the things the government recognises is the importance of teaching and training medical students in rural and regional areas. There are a number of provisions in the budget that address that. One of these is the $238.4 million of funding over five years that will double the Practice Incentives Program teaching payment. This will double the rate for general practices that provide teaching to medical students. That is recognition by this government of how important the job is that those general practices do. There is also a rural loading for that of 50 per cent for rural and regional areas. We have provided $52.5 million over three years for the existing general practices for infrastructure grants so that they can improve their capacity to teach those medical students. We have also provided $13.4 million over three years for an extra 500 scholarships for nursing and allied health, recognising that across the health sector in rural and regional areas it is vital that we take into account all of those professions that are providing such an important service for our rural and regional people. There is also an additional $6 billion in the budget that those opposite may or may not know about for the very important work of the

Unlike those opposite, this government, through the budget, has shown we are absolutely committed to moving away from bureaucracy, moving away from duplication and ensuring we are efficiently and effectively targeting those front-line services. One of the things in the budget is the $52½ million for the rural and regional teaching infrastructure grants. They will provide 175 grants of up to $300,000 each to medical practitioners in rural and remote areas so that those medical practitioners can improve their medical infrastructure, their teaching infrastructure, in those

We have provided $13.4 million for additional scholarships for nursing and allied health. This is particularly going to target areas of workforce shortage. Unlike those opposite, this government recognises that there needs to be a focus on those areas of need. So there will be support for undergraduate and postgraduate students. There is support for continued professional development. There is support for transition to practice training and—very importantly for those on this side that recognise the need—support for people who have been nurses who are looking to re-enter the workforce. We know that is a particular need in rural and regional areas. This government, unlike those opposite, has recognised that.

                                           The one thing you can rely on when it comes to fuel excise—and an understanding of how important excise-free fuel is to regional Australia that is actually out there doing positive things for this economy—is that the Labor Party will come along with a completely empty vessel of understanding of what is actually happening.

                                           The proposals that we have put forward in the budget are responsible. They see Australia through difficult times when we are mopping up after one of the most profligate governments this country has ever seen. They sit over there, oblivious to the mayhem that they have delivered from portfolio to portfolio. These measures are absolutely essential to a sustainable, growing, positive economy; in stark contrast to the absolutely incompetent economic management and mismanagement that we observed for five very long and painful years from this profligate, incompetent opposition when they were in government.

Funding is included in the budget from 2015-16. The program will invest in priority infrastructure in regional communities and will support livability and drive economic growth.
