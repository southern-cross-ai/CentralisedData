        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. Will the minister update the Senate on the situation in Fiji, including Defence's contribution to the Australian government's response?

         I thank Senator Reynolds for her question, which follows up a question earlier in the week when the crisis first began. I particularly note the senator's longstanding interest in defence and her longstanding service in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         , in particular. Our thoughts continue to be with the people of Fiji, who really are facing a very significant humanitarian crisis. There are 36 confirmed deaths and there are approximately 35,000 displaced people in evacuation centres. I am pleased to say that Defence has been able to respond quickly to requests from the government of Fiji, and we are working closely with our international colleagues and other Australian government agencies to ensure the coordination of those efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have established Operation Fiji Assist 2016. Since I updated the Senate on Monday, four ADF
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C17_Globemaster" rel="nofollow">
          C17 Globemaster
         </a>
         s have landed in Fiji. They are carrying helicopters, personnel and around 19 tonnes of humanitarian relief stores in support of the government of Fiji's efforts. The stores include over 1,500 hygiene kits, 10 cartons of water purification tablets, and almost 600 tarpaulins and shelter kits for about 9,000 people. We have also taken in a six-person Australian medical assistance team, which includes doctors, nurses and paramedics. They are assisting the government of Fiji's efforts in assessments and delivery of medical assistance as required. The ADF flights into Fiji have also been able to carry support staff from the departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Immigration and Border Protection. Those staff in Immigration and Border Protection are involved in the process of assisting Australian travellers to depart from Fiji via commercial means and return to Australia.

            Air Force

           elements based in Suva, which is coordinating that surveillance activity and humanitarian assistance. We currently have 32 ADF personnel working in Fiji assisting with the relief efforts. There has also been an exchange of liaison officers to better facilitate effective coordination between the government of Fiji and Australia. Finally, our first of the

             (—) (): Again, I thank Senator Reynolds. There have been two recent further requests from the government of Fiji for additional support. Yesterday, the government of Fiji requested the deployment of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
              HMAS
             </a>

              Canberra
             </i>
             to assist in the relief operation. The ADF is undertaking some quite detailed preparations to deploy HMAS
             <i>
              Canberra
             </i>
             , and she is anticipated to arrive on or around 1 March. It is worthy to note that there is a cyclone of varying degrees between us and Fiji still, so that is a detailed process. This would be the first deployment of HMAS
             <i>
              Canberra
             </i>
             in support of a humanitarian and disaster relief operation overseas. Following a further request from the government of Fiji, a

              P3 Orion

             surveillance aircraft has now also been tasked to assist in the damage assessment. I refer to the work of the

              New Zealand Defence Force
