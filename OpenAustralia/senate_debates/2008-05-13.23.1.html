         On 10 May 2008 the federal Treasurer, Hon. Wayne Swan MP, announced that as part of the budget the Commonwealth government will increase the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds to $100,000 for individuals and $150,000 for families from 1 July 2008. This announcement—

            As I was saying, this announcement has attracted a lot of media interest and clearly interest from the opposition, including our press articles on 13 May 2008. It is estimated to result in published savings of around $299 million over the first four years. This measure was squarely targeted at bringing relief to working families, and it will offer welcome relief for over two million Australians. When the policy was introduced by the former government, they said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            High income earners will be asked to pay a Medicare Levy surcharge if they do not have private health insurance ... These are the people who can afford to purchase health insurance, and this measure will relieve some of the pressure on the public hospital system.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is what was said. These thresholds, originally targeted at high-income earners, have not been moved in a decade. This was a dirty trick played by the previous Liberal government on hundreds of thousands of Australians. That is what it was. I would like to challenge the Liberal Party to find someone who is earning $51,000 who thinks that they are a high-income earner.
           </p>
           <p>
            We promised in opposition to review this measure, and we have. As a result of this change, individuals will be up to $1,000 a year better off—and up to $1,500 for a couple.

            government strongly believes that a mixed model of private and public health services is essential to the provision of universal access to high-quality, affordable healthcare services for all Australians, unlike, it seems from the interruptions from the other side, the current opposition. We are strong supporters of private health insurance and have delivered on all of our election promises in this area. We will retain the full package of private health insurance rebates, a policy which ends the previous government’s practice—

              , on the point of order: on the question of relevance, it is very clear that Senator Ludwig is right on topic. The question that has been asked of him has been addressed by him throughout his answer, and I suggest that this is another attempt at a frivolous point of order. Senator Ludwig is directly on the topic about which he was asked.

                     What the Medicare levy surcharge will do is take some pressure off working families who were already struggling to pay for the rising cost of health care under the previous Liberal government. It is estimated that 11 per cent of privately-insured patients who are treated at a public hospital opt to be treated as public patients. If the previous government really cared about making sure all Australians had access to quality health care, they would have done this long ago. The

                     yesterday attacked the Government for not indexing the surcharge but would not commit a Labor government to indexation. “We now see that because the Government has failed to index the levy that people who are earning average incomes are now being hit with an extra charge,” Ms Roxon said.

                      , I ask a supplementary question. I note that Labor did not advise the Australian people before the election about changes to the Medicare levy surcharge policy. My supplementary question is: isn’t it the case that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, representing the minister in Senate additional estimates earlier this year, committed that there would be no changes to the Medicare levy surcharge policy? Doesn’t this prove the point made by Mr Garrett: ‘Once we get in, we’ll just change it all’?
