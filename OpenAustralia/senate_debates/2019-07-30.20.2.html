           It was a simple question: what is the median household income now compared to 2013? That's what the minister was asked. She hasn't got a brief. Perhaps she could take it on notice.

            Senator Wong, the minister was asked about household income but was also asked an earlier question about the data and its trend over recent years. There were two questions. The minister is entitled to answer either or both of those questions.

                        But what matters to the people of Australia is that they've actually got more of their own money in their pockets. What matters to them is that they've got a government that's focused on a strong economy. What matters to the people of Australia is the fact that we are a government with a plan to continue to deliver for them. You come in here and give us a lecture about the economy of Australia, when your plan going to the last election was $387 billion of more taxes. I don't know what part of that was going to make a stronger economy for all Australians. But, as I said, average household income has risen—

                           Thank you for your follow-up question, Senator. The best way that the Australian government can get people out of poverty is by getting them a job, and we are absolutely focused on creating jobs and creating pathways so that people who want a job can get a job. One thing that I'd say is the ABS data shows that, in real terms, wages are growing. In fact, the sector wages are growing by 2.4 per cent—the highest since December 2014.

                               . As I actually answered in the first part of my answer, in responding to the question: the fact is that on this side of the chamber we understand that the best way to get people out of poverty is to actually get them a job. But not only that. The best way to make sure that we have a country that's strong and that can afford all of the social services that so many Australians depend on is to make sure our economy is strong. And I can assure you that the best way of making the economy strong is not taxing it by $387 billion.

What I'd like to advise the chamber is that, as I said, women's employment has increased significantly over the period of the longitudinal survey, including in recent weeks and recent years. Under the coalition are 1.4 million new jobs and a plan to create more. Female workforce participation is at record highs. Workforce participation for those over the age of 65 has also been increased. More than 100,000 young people got a job in 2017-18—

The minister was asked a question about why Australians are worse off now than when the coalition came to power in 2013. Now, the minister has had 40 seconds. She has spoken a lot about workforce participation et cetera, but this is a question about the trend in household income under her government.
