        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Minister Farrell. Given that the role of Export Finance Australia is to support Australian exports, can the minister inform the Senate of how many loans the

         I thank Senator Van for his question. I don't have those specific details with me today, Senator, but as soon as we leave the chamber I'll get those figures for you and provide them to you as quickly as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government, of course, has had a key focus on the trade issue and trying to expand our trade—both to restore the trade that we had with China and to diversify or encourage the diversification of trade with other countries. The program you're talking about, the export grants program, is very much a feature of trying to assist Australian companies in that expansion program. We'll see tonight from the budget just how much importance trade has in ensuring that we deliver a surplus in this budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a government that supports trade. We're a trading nation. We believe we can do more than we're doing at the moment, and we'll be using programs like the one that you've mentioned to ensure that Australian companies get the best possible support that they can from Austrade, from these grants, to ensure that we continue to build on our strong performance in the trade portfolio.

           Minister, I was referring specifically to defence manufacturers and exporters. I assume you'll need to take this on notice as well, but can you tell the Senate how many of those loans were provided on the commercial account that

            The opportunities for providing assistance to companies exporting defence facilities will be an important part of this government's future trade proposals. Of course, with the AUKUS development, there are opportunities for many Australian companies to seek to export their technology overseas. One of the features, I think, of the most recent changes in the United States' policies with regard to the supply—
