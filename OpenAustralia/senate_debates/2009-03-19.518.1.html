        I will make a short statement to wrap this up. The government can agree to sensibly consider the Greens concern regarding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
         NGO
        </a>
        s. The concern is that employees of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs" rel="nofollow">
         NGOs
        </a>
        will be particularly affected by the amendments in this bill. I can give the government’s assurance that we will seriously consider this and engage with the Greens on this issue promptly—and of course the NGOs in the sector as well.

         Senator Siewert has instructed me to withdraw the Greens amendments that were to be moved now, but that is on the basis of receiving a statement in writing from the minister at the earliest convenience. So I will not be moving the Greens amendments.

          place on record our appreciation to the Greens, to Senator Siewert and Senator Ludlam, for the efforts they have made. Unfortunately, we have not had as good communication on the details of this bill between the government and the Greens as we would have liked. I apologise for that. There is a will on the part of the government to find a solution to the Greens concerns. If they think that the amendments in this bill are genuinely going to disadvantage people, we will take that in good faith.
         </p>
         <p>
          I appreciate Senator Siewert’s cooperation. There was an absolute need to get the bill passed today for the purpose of people declaring their income in the next financial year. So it is very important that the bill pass. Therefore, I really do appreciate the cooperation. If the Greens do not move their amendments then the bill will pass unamended, which is good because the House of Representatives has gone home, as I understand it! That would have created a huge difficulty for the government and for income assessment for the next financial year. So I do appreciate the cooperation and good faith shown. Senator Ludwig and I both understand that Senator Siewert will be after us if we do not deliver. That is a frightening prospect, so I can assure the Senate that it will be taken very seriously.
