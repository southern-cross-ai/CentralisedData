        The Australian Government recognises and has consistently stated that the conflict in Afghanistan will not be ended by military force alone. Political reconciliation and, ultimately, settlement between the Afghan Government and insurgents will be essential to a lasting and durable solution. The Australian Government supports Afghan-led efforts to reach out to elements of the insurgency that might be prepared to lay down their arms and rejoin their communities.

       <p class="italic">
        Australia is supporting the Afghan-led reintegration effort by contributing $25 million to the Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund, subject to the establishment of appropriate governance arrangements and role for donors, like Australia, in the administration of the fund. The Australian Government welcomes the release of the Afghan Government's draft Peace and Reintegration Plan, which set out a number of preconditions for reintegration, including renouncing violence, ceasing support for the insurgency, recognising the Afghan Constitution, and cutting all current and future tics with al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. These pre-conditions arc of course a matter for the Afghan Government to determine.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Migration Act 1958 (the Act) provides the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) with discretionary, non-compellable, and non-delegable powers to resolve cases, if it is considered in the public interest to do so. Therefore, Ministerial Intervention (MI) processes differ from those in the codified visa framework.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report" rel="nofollow">
         The Report
        </a>
        identified a number of issues for reform of MI under the Act, including the need for greater accountability, transparency and procedural fairness. It also recommended regulation changes allowing greater access to the migration visa framework, thereby providing access to review and reducing the number of MI cases.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2008, the government commissioned Ms Elizabeth Proust to provide advice to the Minister on arrangements for the exercise of the Minister’s public interest powers. The Proust Report, released in July 2008, reiterated a number of issues outlined in the Senate Select Committee’s Report. It recommended that, to the extent MI was retained, it should be very limited and subject to strict guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Both Reports supported the retention of MI to deal with cases which are unable to be resolved within the codified visa framework in the Act but which, nevertheless, require a migration outcome.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Taking into account the views of the Com­mittee and the Proust Report, the government and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIAC" rel="nofollow">
         DIAC

        The Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) is a carefully directed response to Australia's international obligations not to refoule persons who might engage Australia's protection by meeting the Refugee Convention definition of a refugee. It provides publicly funded application assistance and independent and professional immigration advice to vulnerable clients seeking protection in immigration detention, and to the most disadvantaged, vulnerable Protection Visa (

        A MI request is not a visa application process, nor does it require applicants to comply with statutory criteria. MI is intended as a safeguard to resolve unique or exceptional circumstances and not as a standard part of the visa application process. As clients request MI at their own discretion after receiving an immigration outcome, it is not appropriate for IAAAS services to be available to this group.

        It should be noted, however, that the Migration Amendment (Complementary Protection) Bill 2011 is before the Parliament.

Where IAAAS assistance is available, these complementary protection considerations may be brought within the operation of the IAAAS.

        Existing provisions in migration legislation may offer further options in certain circumstances to applicants who fail to seek merits review. Section 48 of the Act enables a person whose visa application has been refused, whether or not they have sought merits review, to apply for a range of specified visas, including a PV if they have not already applied for such a visa.

       <p class="italic">
        The Minister also has the personal power under section 48B of the Act to allow a person who did not seek review of a PV refusal to lodge a further PV application. If that application is unsuccessful at the primary stage and at review, the MI power becomes available. Additionally, section 195A of the Act provides the Minister with a personal non-compellable power to grant a visa to a person who is in immigration detention, if the Minister considers it to be in the public interest to do so, whether or not the person has applied for a visa.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Making MI available only after both the primary decision and merits review was intended to preserve the statutory basis and consistency of visa decision making generally, while also providing a safety net for unique and exceptional cases after all of the formal processes have concluded. The comprehensive criteria in the Migration Regulations for each visa class which are considered at both the primary and review stage, allow for a structured and transparent assessment process to be undertaken.
