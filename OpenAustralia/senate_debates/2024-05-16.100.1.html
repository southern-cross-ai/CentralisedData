       <p>
        Overnight the Prime Minister of Slovakia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fico" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Fico
        </a>
        , was shot in an attempted assassination. He's in a critical condition. On behalf of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        , I send our prayers to the Prime Minister and hope for his speedy recovery and return to work. Slovakia has only just returned the Fico government, on a platform that stood out against globalist influence on Slovakia from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        and the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        This platform includes opposing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" rel="nofollow">
         World Health Organization
        </a>
        pandemic treaty, opposing the international health regulation amendments and any measure that takes away Slovakian sovereignty. Clearly, the attempt on the Prime Minister's life is the work of someone who feels the Slovakian people should not be allowed to break away from the controlled state being constructed in Europe and make their own way in the world, just as their neighbour Hungary has done under Prime Minister Orban.

        President-elect Peter Pellegrini called the shooting an 'unprecedented threat' to democracy and warned against expressing political opinions with pistols in squares instead of voting in polling stations, a sentiment true for our divided country. As Churchill said, 'The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.' Prime Minister Fico displayed such vigilance in standing against unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats in Brussels, Geneva, London, Europe and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">

        . Australia must be vigilant against the continued subversion of our democracy by these same people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Prime Minister Albanese, Australia has seen a procession of bills designed to subvert Australian democracy. Today we see yet another guillotine. Thursdays have become 'guillotine Thursday' as the government rams one freedom-destroying bill through after another to avoid oversight. Indeed, as we speak, the government is doing exactly that with the Digital

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        is the house of review. This government, the Greens and some crossbench senators are making a mockery of our solemn duty. One Nation wants to know who's pulling this government's strings. It's clearly not the Australian people.
