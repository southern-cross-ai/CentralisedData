         <p>
          As briefly mentioned in my contribution on the substantive bill, the coalition is moving a number of amendments which will give effect to providing immediate relief to small businesses across our country who are suffering from labour shortages. In addition to that, it will remove a significant disincentive to many older Australians who want to re-enter the workforce. That disincentive is that the Work Bonus scheme provides up to $300 a fortnight before older Australians are penalised for every extra dollar they earn. The amendment will lift that from $300 a fortnight to $600 a fortnight.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are confident that that is an initiative, is an incentive, that many older Australians will find attractive. Many of them will be encouraged and will desire to re-enter the workforce, for a variety of reasons—and we can't underestimate how important work is to people's self-esteem.
         </p>
         <p>
          This has been predicated on a very immediate and urgent problem for many older Australians and that is the escalating cost of living. It is hurting older Australians the hardest. We think this is the right time through which to embrace these initiatives, amend this bill and provide that immediate relief for older Australians, and, in doing so, provide small- to medium-size businesses in our country with greater labour options.

           will be supporting the amendments that have been moved by the opposition because, as I foreshadowed in my speech in the second reading debate, we will be supporting any measures that will improve income support in our society. Obviously, these measures that Senator Smith has put forward again only address the issues being faced by older people—in this case, allowing people on the age pension to be able to earn more—but we think that's a good start. We think that should be supported. We need a more generous income support system in this country across the board. This is a good start.
          </p>
          <p>
           Poverty is a political choice. We can choose to introduce measures here that will lift people out of poverty, and this is a good measure that will help lift people out of poverty. So we will be supporting this measure but, again, we call upon the opposition and we call upon the Labor Party to actually do much more. There are people across the board, whether they are young or old, whether they are working or not working, who are really, really struggling. They are doing it so tough. They are struggling to put food on the table. They are not able to afford rent and are then being made homeless. They cannot afford medicines. Australians across the board are struggling with all of these things. We will support this measure as one measure that will help some Australians. It's a start, but it's not enough.

                ; that's very good advice. I should ignore most things the opposition says.

                The TEMPORARY CHAIR: Senator Farrell, come to the point.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thank you for that reminder, Chair. The former government spent nine years doing nothing to boost workforce participation. It was the last Labor government that introduced the Work Bonus, in 2009. Only in the last month or so has the opposition taken steps to encourage pensioner workforce participation, through Senator Dean Smith's private senators' bill. However, Senator Smith's bill is just a doubling of the existing Work Bonus and doesn't provide pensioners with the flexibility that the government bill offers.
               </p>
               <p>
                The government has announced that from 1 December 2022 until 30 June 2023, pensioners of the age pension age will benefit from a $4,000 increase in the maximum Work Bonus income bank balance, and that results in an increase from $7,800 to $11,800. This increase will be credited to eligible pensioners' income banks upfront so they will be able to earn an additional $4,000 from employment income this financial year without losing any of their pension. This provides an immediate benefit to any pensioner over age pension age who works, and will help address labour shortages.

                 I understand we have the opposition's amendments before us. From the government benches, I'm seeking to properly understand them. I know they've made a case for increasing the Work Bonus, but, as I understand it, the first $300 of fortnightly income is not assessed and is not counted under the pension income test, and that any unused part of the Work Bonus can be accrued up to a maximum of $7,800. Can you please explain this, Minister, as I'm keen to understand how the accrual works. I know that we're really keen, for example, to see people being able to make the most of seasonal work. We have the great privilege here in this place of being served by the amazing Comcar workforce. Many of those people are retirees and some of them pensioners. So, I'm interested to understand the time over which you can accrue that in terms of using it up. Clearly people want to save money. They don't just want to accrue a maximum of $7,800; they also want to be able to spend that money, or to save it—and they don't want to max out. So, I'm interested to know, in the context of this bill—and if we've got an understanding of what the opposition understands—the time period for that accrual.

                 <p>
                  Thank you, Senator. I take that as a great compliment—that, with all the resources available to the government, the government senator needs to ask the opposition about the detail of how the existing social security income support mechanism works in our country! That is the first point. The second point is that that question was two minutes and 20 seconds in length. In the parliament we call that filibustering; we don't call that a question. In my contribution earlier today I said that the government was lukewarm, half-hearted, about wanting to improve the circumstances facing older Australians and was lukewarm, half-hearted, in wanting to correct labour shortage issues in our country. You saw it for yourself. You're witnessing it for yourself. We can deal with this very quickly.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The government can add it to its bill. And, by the time we leave this parliament tonight, older Australians will be given a clear way of combating escalating cost-of-living increases. In addition to that, many small businesses across our country will have an immediate answer to some of the most pressing economic needs that they are facing. Instead, the government and its senators want to delay the vote that would put this into the law now. Senator Pratt, well-supported by advisers from the government, knows the answers to the questions she's asking me. I encourage her and I encourage Senator Farrell and Senator Polley—and I thank Senator Rice for her contribution—the time is now to make life easier for older Australians and small businesses.

                      With respect, Senator Ruston was making a comment, and I was simply responding to her comment. She's now left the chamber, but at the point I made my comment—

                     <p>
                      The TEMPORARY CHAIR: You know that it is not practice to refer to senators leaving the chamber, because they may be leaving the chamber for a variety of reasons. But you have the call.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Well, I was simply responding to your query about why I was referring to Senator Ruston, and the reason I was referring to Senator Ruston is simply that she made a comment and I was responding to that comment. I will repeat my comment that the reason we have such difficulty with the issue of labour shortages is the circumstances in which the former government left the Australian economy.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I have some questions regarding just how there is going to be an interaction between the amendments that the opposition is putting forward today and the proposed amendments and bill that the government is putting forward. The first observation I would make is that the government amendment changes the commencement date for the legislation to enact the government's election commitments to increase the income limits for the Commonwealth seniors card holders to $90,000 for singles and $144,000 for couples combined. Due to the suspension of parliament following the untimely death of
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty_Queen_Elizabeth_II" rel="nofollow">
                       Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II
                      </a>
                      , the bill to implement this commitment could not be passed in time for the increase to be implemented on 20 September 2022 and that was obviously the intention of the government. To minimise the delays, this amendment will allow an increase in the income limits to take effect seven days following royal assent of the bill. This is the minimum time required by Services Australia to finalise the required systems and business processes once a final date is known.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The Commonwealth Seniors Health Card income limits are indexed each year on 20 September according to movements based on the consumer price index, and the existing bill would have replaced the indexation on 20 September 2022 with a very significant one-off increase. As the bill did not pass, the indexation of the limits proceeded on 20 September as required by the existing law. My question to Senator Smith this: How does your amendment work with the government's legislation and proposed amendments?

                        I have a further question. By way of prefacing that question, our amendment, the one that we are proposing today which has not yet been presented to the Senate for voting on, removes material that would have prevented that annual indexation for 2022. Following indexation on 20 September 2022, the income limits for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card are currently $61,284 for singles and $98,054 for couples combined. The bill, as amended, will still raise the income limits only to the intended levels of $90,000 for singles and $144,000 for couples combined. The bill includes amendments to both the

                        Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act to ensure the same income limits apply for Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders as provided under each act. Like other Australians, many self-funded retirees are facing increased cost-of-living pressures in the current economic environment. This bill helps to ease those pressures by allowing more self-funded retirees to access Australian government health concessions, including concessions on co-payments for

                        medicines, the concessional thresholds for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Safety Net and extended Medicare Safety Nets, and bulk-billed visits to general practitioners. My question to Senator Smith in this context is: is it proposed under your amendment that it only last for 12 months?

                         I repeat what I have said, and it's worth reminding people that might be in the chamber or observing on the television that at 11.15 the Senate must move to another term of business: every minute that the government spends asking questions that it knows the answer to, because sitting next to the government are government advisers, delays a vote being put on the opposition's amendments which would allow relief for older Australians today and would allow answers to labour shortage issues for small businesses today. The government is seeking to frustrate and to delay the opportunity for this Senate chamber to vote on amendments that would make life easier for older Australians and for businesses across our country.

                         We've just had a jobs and skills summit, at the beginning of September. It is now a month later and we still do not see in this Senate chamber any remedy from the government for how to deal with skyrocketing—that is not my word but the Treasurer's word—cost-of-living pressures for older Australians. We still see no remedy from the government that is about the relief that it will offer small and medium-sized businesses across Australia that are suffering severely—not my word but the Treasury's word, which they shared with senators at a committee inquiry last week.

                         The government is seeking to frustrate what is a very, very reasonable request that the opposition is making on behalf of many older Australians, on behalf of many businesses and on behalf of organisations like the

                           That was a very pious response from Senator Smith, in terms of the allegation that the government are the ones frustrating the process here. The government have put this bill forward. This bill is here to amend the income limits for the Commonwealth seniors health card. The bill that amendments the income limits and threshold for pensioner earnings is currently still in the other place, and we're not supposed to actually debate these kinds of issues concurrently. What we have here is a legitimate need for the government to go: 'Right. We've suddenly been lumped with these amendments, and we're canvassing to see what level of support they will get so that we can work out what is going to happen in this place.' We're not here to frustrate the Senate. We're here to be a good government.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The simple fact of the matter is that Senator Smith's amendments belong to the other bill. They don't belong to this bill, which is about lifting the income limit for the Commonwealth seniors health card. It has nothing to do with the income thresholds that affect how much your pension might be discounted depending on how much you work. They're entirely separate questions, which this government—our government, the Labor Party—has rightly chosen to pursue in two different pieces of legislation.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Senator Smith has sought to be the one frustrating this process by moving these amendments to an entirely different bill and landing them on us in this point in time. Given the fact that Senator Smith did in fact have a private member's bill on these very questions, I fully expected him to be diligent in pursuing them. But it's not being diligent in this bill, because it's not relevant to this legislation.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The legislation that it should have been pursuing in terms of proper process is still to come to this place. What happens, for example, if the other place makes amendments on the same legislation that affect the income limits and earning capacity of pensioners? They are still playing with that bill in the other place. They're still debating it and looking at it. It is entirely inappropriate for this Senate now to be at cross-purposes in terms of what the legislative outcome might be. It is simply not sensible to proceed in this way today.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           If there is any reason that I had to stand up 10 minutes ago, while we were trying to work out what the opposition's intentions were, and filibuster for a few moments, it might simply have been a legitimate purpose to work out: What is the opposition playing at here? What is the right process for us to go through here? What is the purpose? The simple fact is that the other place is dealing with that legislation. I know it's due to come before them. Is it actually before them?

                               It's been introduced in the other place. That was the plan, for it to be introduced in that place, and I know that because we dealt with the issue in the Labor Party caucus meeting recently. It was the due and proper process. You're going completely at cross-purposes by seeking to move amendments to a different bill that really should be dealt with in the bill that has just come to the other place.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               I call on the Greens and I call on those opposite: let's deal with these issues sensibly. Please deal with them sensibly. We cannot and we should not second-guess what is going on in the other place. It is entirely inappropriate that we do that. We have careful protocols in this place to ensure that we wait for a message to go from one place to the other so that when a question is determined it reflects the will and the endorsement of both houses. I'm really not sure what the state of confusion would be if you had an amended, or not amended, bill coming up this way at the same time that this chamber was making a change to an entirely different piece of legislation that intersected with the other bill.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               Let's be clear. We're talking about the bill to change the income threshold for pensioner healthcare cards. That is the legislation that is before us today. It is keenly awaited by retirees, who face cost of living pressures because they cannot access the cheaper medicines, for example, that pensioners and other concession cardholders can access. It fits in very nicely, frankly, with this government's decision to lower the price of medicine for all Australians. We are going from $40 a script, where a script is above that amount, down to $30. This is a very good step forward, but for retirees, who are under real income pressure, we are very pleased to be prioritising in this legislation today the needs of retirees and their ability to access more-affordable health care and more-affordable medicine. Instead, we have from the opposition, including Senator Dean Smith, an attempt to subvert the outcome of a bill that is still before the other place and that is still to come to us.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               We can't predict whether the other place might make amendments that usurp the amendments that have been moved by Senator Dean Smith on the amount a pensioner can earn before their pension is affected and starts to reduce based on the fact that they have earned $7,800 within 12 months. That is in the legislation before the other place and is due to be lifted to $11,800. What Senator Dean Smith is trying to do is change the income limit here and now in a completely unrelated bill while the House of Representatives is still dealing with that question. It is patently ridiculous for that to be the case. These are separate pieces of legislation, and these amendments should not be moved here and now. That, in and of itself, provides good reason for the Labor Party not to support the amendments, quite apart from the policy questions and our policy position and policy debate on that legislation, which is proceeding with the minister introducing that legislation in the place. That legislation is to be announced and proceeded with in the other place.

                                    and its half-hearted interest in this issue. Why is that? Because if Senator Pratt's contribution is correct then the government has, in the last few moments—in the last few minutes—introduced a bill that is similar to, but not the same as, these amendments. It's similar but different; same-same but different. Why are they different? Because the bill that the government might have just introduced in the House of Representatives comes, remind yourself, a month after it announced the

                                    and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022. The important distinction is this: the government's bill is temporary; these amendments are permanent; and the government's initiative is half as generous. So if you were looking for any evidence of the government's half-heartedness and lukewarm interest in fixing cost-of-living issues for older Australians and meeting the challenges of labour shortages in our country, you have it for yourself. There might just be a bill in the House of Representatives introduced in the last few minutes which shows and demonstrates half-heartedness and a lack of interest.

                                    Senator Pratt says that this is not the right place to put these age-pension income support initiatives. Well, if it can't go in a social security bill, where should it go? It can't go in a defence bill, it can't go in a veterans bill, and it can't go in an ASIC bill or an APRA bill. The bill we are debating—the bill that the government has brought to the Senate—is called the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022. This is exactly the place to put a social services initiative. It's exactly the place. Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if the bill that the government has introduced in the last few minutes in the House of Representatives is called the 'Social Services (Worker Incentive) Bill'. How ludicrous! We have seen it. In the last 45 minutes, the government has decided to delay, to put on the back burner, an initiative that this Senate could have endorsed and would have started to make life easier for older Australians and small to medium-sized businesses.

                                      Really? How remarkable. This is the last sitting day until 25 October. Wow. So that place isn't even going to be able to talk about these initiatives until 25 October. This place isn't going to be able to consider these amendments until 25 October. The Labor Party thinks it can play with the livelihoods of older Australians and play with the livelihoods of small to medium-sized businesses across our country. It's remarkable. This is an important and critical issue. Agriculture producers across our country, small businesses, the chambers of commerce, National Seniors Australia, Council on the Ageing and the Antipoverty Centre are all saying that something more must be done for people. This is a modest initiative, but the government is putting maximum effort into delay and frustration.

Why isn't it in the Senate? Why are older Australians waiting? I would be asking Senator Farrell: why is the Labor government's initiative temporary, when the coalition's initiative is permanent? And I'd be asking Senator Farrell: why is it less generous? These are the questions that I would be asking Senator Farrell.
