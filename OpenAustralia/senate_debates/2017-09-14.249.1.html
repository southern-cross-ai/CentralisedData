        I want to rise as a servant to the people of Tasmania and Australia to make an offer to one of the better-known servants of people in this place—that is, a servant to the people of Queensland, Senator Malcolm Roberts. In the interest of cross-Senate cooperation and as an expression of the Greens goodwill, I indicate that I have a speaking spot reserved in the adjournment debate tonight, and I offer it to Senator Roberts for his valedictory speech!
       </p>
       <p>
        As senators would know, in valedictory speeches it is customary for senators to do a number of things, such as to thank the people that voted for them—so, Senator Roberts could decide to thank the 76 people that voted for him. Senators also talk about the topics that are precious to them and the topics that they've spoken about a lot in this place. Of course, red tape is one of the topics that Senator Roberts has spoken about at length in this place. He would have an opportunity to explain what he means—and this is a direct quote from Senator Roberts in the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        <i>
        </i>
        when he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … cost of energy; cost of doing business; red, blue, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        … tape—
       </p>
       <p>
        UN tape—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        taxes; fees; charges. At every turn, governments … have their hands in the pockets of Aussies, stealing our money.
       </p>
       <p>
        He'd have an opportunity to explain that.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I think the people of Queensland and Australia, the people that Senator Roberts purports to serve, would be most grateful for is an explanation from Senator Roberts about exactly how—and this is a direct quote from
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        <i>
         :
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the rainbow coloured, solar powered unicorns …
       </p>
       <p>
        are going to die. I look forward to that, and I'm sure the people of Queensland do as well. He could also explain—and I quote again directly from
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        the empirical evidence behind the:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Transgender pixies riding their solar-powered unicorns over oh-so-sustainable rainbows …
       </p>
       <p>
        I mean, we are going to miss him,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        —are we not? He could also, of course, explain what exactly he meant when he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We heard all about the Chicken Littles—
       </p>
       <p>
        And I want to emphasise: I'm quoting directly from the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        here—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        bwok bwok bekerk!
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Roberts could explain—

          The soon-to-be Mr Roberts could explain how he subscribed to
          <i>
           The Australian
          </i>
          for a more balanced coverage of politics in this country. He could let us know what actually happens in illuminati meetings, and whether the tin-foil hats actually fit!

          , thank you for your indulgence. I'm sure everyone can agree we will miss him, and we urge him not to let the doors of this chamber hit him on the backside on the way out.
