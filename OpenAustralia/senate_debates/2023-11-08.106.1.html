       <p>
        While there has been some good news in Queensland, with positive rainfall over the past few days, over the last week we've witnessed some shocking bushfires across Queensland, including on the Downs and, just down the road from me, in Warwick. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the first responders, especially our volunteer rural firies, across Queensland, without whom we'd have absolutely no hope against the blazes ripping across Queensland. From here in the Senate, our thoughts go to our communities affected, and we thank our emergency services for their incredible efforts. I would particularly like to send my heart out to the three staff members of AGAIR that were killed in a plane crash over the weekend while fire-mapping across north-west Queensland. Our condolences from the Senate go to their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our thoughts also go to Ulrich Widawski and Glenda Chapman, who were tragic victims of the fires in the Tara region of the Western Downs. Our hearts and condolences go out to their friends and families at this difficult time. Many people have lost their homes. I would encourage those watching and listening: donate to your charity of choice to help your fellow Australians and your fellow Queenslanders at this very difficult time. Thank you for your consideration.
