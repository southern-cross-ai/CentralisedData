       <p class="italic">
        The proposed high speed rail link between Brisbane and Melbourne via Sydney and Canberra is a project that requires vision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a significant undertaking—more than 1,700 kilometres long.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is challenging—it will involve the construction of tens of kilometres of tunnels.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is complex, necessarily involving the governments of Queensland,

        </a>
        as well as dozens of local councils.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is for these reasons that this bill proposes to create an 11 person high speed rail authority to bring together all affected states and territories as well as rail and engineering experts to progress planning and, critically, focus on the corridor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Members would include:

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Anthony Albanese first introduced this bill in the other place in December 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, a lack of political will from the Abbott Government meant the bill lapsed, requiring its reintroduction in October 2015 and now again in this chamber.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It could have been debated in the other place on both occasions. Indeed, at one stage it was literally the only piece of legislation before the House of Representatives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yet the coalition government showed no vision, despite the fact that people like former trade minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robb" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Robb
        </a>
        , have come out as strong supporters of high speed rail.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Robb stated that he could produce the names of international companies that had told him they could deliver the project in full.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any politician who tells you that they can fund an entire rail line using value capture is pulling your leg.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And like most of the government's thought bubbles, the idea collapsed within hours when the parliamentary secretary for cities ruled out support for the project.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was another lost opportunity from a government that had a plan to win government but no plan to govern.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Former transport minister, Mr Albanese, commissioned a two-part study involving extensive consultation with industry and international operators of high speed rail, as well as significant community input.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The study, published in April 2013, included the business case for the project, consideration of environmental issues, projections of patronage, the proposed route, proposed stations and proposed timelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It found that high speed rail down the east coast of Australia was indeed a viable proposition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example, it found that high speed rail would return, for the Sydney to Melbourne section, $2.15 in economic benefit for every dollar invested.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report found that once fully operational across the Brisbane to Melbourne corridor; high speed rail could carry approximately 84 million passengers a year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At speeds of 350 kilometres per hour, people would be able to travel from Melbourne to Sydney or Melbourne to Brisbane in less than three hours. Of course, new technology is seeing speeds in excess of that.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report found that Commonwealth leadership and coordination would be essential, given the number of jurisdictions involved.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        High speed rail would also be an engineering challenge, requiring at least 80 kilometres of tunnels, including 67 kilometres in Sydney alone.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But despite these challenges, the experts have said that high speed rail has huge potential, particularly if we consider where our society is headed over coming decades.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We can anticipate significant population growth over coming decades along the route of this proposed line.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We can also anticipate that growing pressure for a carbon-constrained economy will drive the economics of this project ever more positively over time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We can also anticipate that if we fail to act soon, delivery of high speed rail will be made more difficult and more costly because parts of the corridor will be built out by urban sprawl.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why this bill proposes to create an 11-person high speed rail authority to bring together all the key stakeholders as outlined earlier.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In government, Labor undertook a proper process to come to the position that a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Speed_Rail" rel="nofollow">
         High Speed Rail
        </a>
        Authority was needed. The High Speed Rail Advisory Group included people such as the former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, the Business Council of Australia's chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, and Australasian Railway Association chief executive Bryan Nye.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was chaired by the deputy secretary of my former department, Lyn O'Connell.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Serious people having a look at a serious issue and coming up with serious suggestions about the way forward, and a way forward that should have been bipartisan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why the former Labor government embraced these recommendations, which were unanimous, and allocated $54 million to establish the authority and begin the process of corridor acquisition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But in 2013 the incoming coalition government scrapped this allocation and turned its back on the project.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To best understand the potential of high speed rail, we need to look well beyond 2017 and consider where this nation will be in coming decades.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We know that our population will be larger.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We know that this growth will be concentrated precisely on the route of this high speed rail proposal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We can also expect the world will have moved in terms of economic options as it is doing in Asia and Europe towards rail. Rail is the transport of the 21st Century.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        According to the high speed rail study I referred to earlier, travel on the east coast of Australia is forecast to grow by about 1.8 per cent every year over the next two decades and to increase by 60 per cent by 2035.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The study said east coast trips would double from 152 million trips in 2009 to 355 million trips in 2065.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is another compelling reason to proceed with high speed rail, and that is the boost to regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Stations are proposed for the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This project will position these centres to take some of the population growth pressure off our capital cities, which will no doubt be a key issue in the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, it will also provide for uplift value by the economic improvement that will occur in those regional centres to be factored into the funding, building and construction of the high speed rail line.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It could also deliver a massive improvement in liveability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Travelling from a regional centre to of one of Australia's fast growing east coast cities in under an hour will transform those centres and facilitate new business.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Vision is one of the obligations of leadership, and the Labor party is leading the charge in policy development in this Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We must imagine a better future and take actions to create that future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have done the research.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We know that the project is viable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What this chamber needs to do is commit to the next step required to make high speed rail a reality—the creation of an authority to advance detailed planning and work with other jurisdictions and begin to acquire the corridor before it is built out by urban sprawl is needed now.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        True leaders do not just sit around waiting for the telephone to ring and be told what to do next. They act on what they believe in and get on with the job of governing Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Parliament should show some genuine leadership by acting on high speed rail, starting with debating and supporting this bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I fear this is unlikely, given the Government's refusal to debate this issue in recent years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But there is light at the end of the tunnel.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A Shorten Labor government will act where the Abbott-Turnbull governments have failed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will establish a high speed rail authority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will ask the authority to move quickly towards calling for expressions of interest from international rail companies that have shown a capacity to deliver real projects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor is prepared to think ahead and future generations will be the beneficiaries.

       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
