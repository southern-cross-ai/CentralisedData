        The first review by the

         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        into the progress of the Closing the Gap agreement was released this week. The review outlined the path forward for us in this place. That pathway requires a strong emphasis on self-determination, trust and power sharing with Aboriginal and

        communities. Governments, including us in this place, must acknowledge and act on the reality that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        people know what is best for their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very fortunate to come from a state with a long and proud history of achievement and excellence from First Nations people. I grew up surrounded by and learning from elders and Aboriginal leaders who paved the way in self-determination. Victoria now leads the nation in ensuring decision-making powers are in Aboriginal hands. I hope the success of my home state can be a model in the national conversation around Aboriginal affairs going forward. We must continue to build on the strength and resilience of First Nations people to achieve better outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The findings of the Productivity Commission's review and the promises made by government are not just simply words to me; this is my story, too. This is the story of my sons, my aunties, my uncles, my family and my community. It is the reason I stand here today and the reason I will continue to advocate for First Nations people. To my mob, I want to be clear: we hear you and we will continue to stand with you. As we shape future policy that will bridge the divide between Indigenous and non-

        , I look forward to continuing the conversation that builds on our strength and resilience as a community together. After all, we are all accountable for delivering practical and lasting improvements for our First Nations people. This is not the end of the discussion.
       </p>
       <p>
        When looking into the future, there is a responsibility on governments to do better. As commissioners Romlie Mokak and Natalie Siegel-Brown so accurately describe it:
