        With regard to item No. 3 on page 8 of the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_Paper" rel="nofollow">
          Notice Paper
         </a>
        </i>
        , there is an amendment of the motion to take note of the second report of the Finance and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Administration_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Public Administration Committee
        </a>
        on the operation of the Senate order on departmental and agency contracts. That amendment is agreed by all parties; it is a procedural amendment. However, until such time as the document is considered and has been taken note of, of course the document will stay on the
        <i>
         Notice Paper
        </i>
        and therefore the amendment cannot come into play. So it is important from a technical perspective to separate the two out. I seek leave therefore to move a motion now in relation to that report on the Senate order on agency contracts so that that motion can be dealt with and the report can remain on the
        <i>
         Notice Paper
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p>
        That recommendations 11 and 13 of the second report of the Finance and Public Administration Committee on the operation of the Senate order for the production of lists of departmental and agency contracts be adopted.

         Senator Murray, I am not sure in my capacity here that I have been advised of our position on this motion. I accept your indication that that is the case.

          Perhaps I could explain briefly. The matter was cleared with the chair and deputy chair of the committee, and with the whip. Unfortunately, the whips have changed, so the same whip is not in place.

            The motion was agreed by the chair and deputy chair of the committee, initiated by the government, and the whip on your side was advised, but of course the whip has changed so the message has not been passed on. It is a procedural, technical amendment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question agreed to.
           </p>
           <p>
            I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

            Leave granted; debate adjourned.
