        My question is to the

         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        , Senator Farrell. It is really important that all eligible Australians are enrolled to vote in the lead-up to this year's referendum. However, we know that some groups have faced barriers to enrolling which have seen them unrepresented on the electoral roll and, therefore, unable to participate. I understand that's why the government has been supporting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Electoral Commission
        </a>
        to remove barriers for these Australians, which has already led to significant increases in enrolment. Can the minister please update the Senate on the record number of Australians now on the electoral roll?

         I thank Senator Green for her interest in this area; it's a very important part of our democracy. Yes, I can update you on the issues you raised. After coming to government, the Albanese government funded the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
          AEC
         </a>
         to improve Indigenous enrolment. Earlier this year, we acted to remove regulatory barriers and support greater enrolment of eligible Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         This has been paying dividends. Last week the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Electoral Commission
         </a>
         announced that enrolment in Australia has skyrocketed, ahead of the 2023 referendum. National enrolment is now estimated to be at 97.5 per cent—I'll repeat that figure: 97.5 per cent—with over 17.5 million Australians on the electoral roll.
        </p>
        <p>
         More significantly, enrolment of underrepresented groups is going through the roof. Enrolment of young Australians is over 90 per cent for the first time in the nation's history, and more
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         Australians are now enrolled than ever before, with enrolment at 94.1 per cent. And remember this: this is up from 80 per cent in June 2022, shortly before we came to government.

            AEC

            First Nations

           Australians clearly want to have a say on the Voice to Parliament. Young people want to have a say on the Voice to Parliament, and we are committed to working with the AEC to ensure all eligible Australians are enrolled to vote. The referendum is an opportunity for all Australians to get behind the Voice to Parliament, and I encourage Australians to make sure they are enrolled to vote in the lead-up to the important referendum.

              First Nations
             </a>
             Australians want to have their say on the Voice. This isn't really surprising, since the Voice is an idea that came from Aboriginal and

              enrolment. As I outlined, enrolment of First Nations Australians is now at a record level because First Nations Australians clearly want to participate in the referendum on the Voice. This is no surprise, as the Voice came from First Nations Australians and is widely backed by First Nations Australians. We keep hearing from First Nations Australians who are ready to get behind the Voice. This includes

                 I thank Senator Green for her second supplementary question. The Albanese government has taken action to improve enrolment of all Australians, and I'm pleased to say that young Australians aged between 18 and 24 are now enrolled at record levels. Members of this cohort of young Australians are eager to have their say in the first referendum in their lifetime, and I'm confident that young Australians are ready to get behind the Voice to Parliament.

                  My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. On at least 34 occasions, the Prime Minister has committed to implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. In 2017, on the

                  the Prime Minister was asked on seven occasions whether he supported a treaty. He refused to give a direct answer. Does the government's commitment to implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full include committing to a treaty?

                   This government does support bringing Australians together, and that is what makarrata is about. That is also what the Voice is about. What we know is that those opposite want to talk about everything other than what the referendum is about. That is what they want to do. Really, it reflects upon them that this is the approach they choose to take on an issue that is so important to the heart and soul of the nation. Senator

                     I'll take the interjection from Senator Cash, the chief fearmonger on that side. You want to talk about everything other than how a voice might help

                     I think Australians do want to close the gap. I think Australians know that what we have done to date, on both sides of politics over many decades, has left us with a gap that is unacceptable. People should be clear that we want to implement the Voice that First Nations people have asked for, because we believe that when you listen to people you get better outcomes. We want to close the gap between our Aboriginal and

                         I think we have again on display the same tactic which I referenced in response to the primary question. You want to talk about everything but the Voice. You want to talk about what Mr Pearson said. You want to talk about some documents that you've now found—in relation to a statement that you used to support. I will make this point, because those opposite want to talk about treaties: what has happened since 1986 is that treaties and agreements are already underway in Victoria, Queensland and the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                          Northern Territory

                         . You know what? At the time and, I believe, subsequently, those processes were supported by the Victorian Liberal and National parties, the Queensland
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">

                         </a>
                         and others from the parties of those opposite. I actually wasn't sure that was true, Senator

                         </a>
                         , and I went back and asked my office to check: 'Is it really true the Queensland LNP did support this process?' They did, which shows what you are doing now.

                           Minister, on 20 February you made a statement on social media saying '#VoteForTheVoice #VoiceTreatyTruth'. Doesn't your own statement confirm that the Albanese government intends to begin negotiating a treaty should the Voice referendum be successful? Or was your statement supporting a treaty just a throwaway line?

                             I would say this. I would say that the Voice is nothing to be afraid of. I would say that the Voice is nothing like the sorts of political bogeymen that those on the other side wish to keep utilising. I would also make this point to those opposite: I believe that there are some things bigger than politics, and I would ask those opposite to reflect on whether they really want to use the soul and fabric of this nation as a political battleground.
