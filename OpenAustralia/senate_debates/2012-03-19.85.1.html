          Austin Mackell is a young Australian freelance journalist who moved to Egypt in February last year. His writings have been featured in respected media outlets across the world, including the
          <i>
           Guardian
          </i>
          ,
          <i>
           Al-Akhbar
          </i>
          , Crikey and newmatilda.
         </p>
         <p>
          On 11 February, when Mr Mackell sought to interview Kamal el-Fayoumi, a well-known trade unionist and labour activist, he and his party were attacked by a small group. Mr Mackell and his colleagues were instructed by a police officer to come to a police station for their own protection. Over the next 56 hours they were held in custody. They were all repeatedly interrogated. During this time they were allowed minimal communication with the outside world. Some Egyptian activists—such as Shahira Abouelleil, Kareem el-Behairy and Omar Kamel—followed the detainees, tweeted their location to the outside world and brought in lawyers to help them. The four detainees are being investigated for crimes involving inciting people to vandalise public property and government buildings. Specifically it is alleged that they promised children money if they threw rocks.
         </p>
         <p>
          The crimes for which Mr Mackell is being investigated are similar in kind to charges against others who have reported about human and civil rights abuses. Since their release they have faced various threats and harassment. Mr Mackell is concerned that personal information that has been taken from his computer will be copied, possibly compromising his work as a journalist and placing his sources at risk. Mr Mackell has reported suppression of protesters by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Council" rel="nofollow">
           Supreme Council
          </a>
          of the

           Armed Forces
          </a>
          , which currently rules Egypt. Mr Mackell is an Australian citizen who urgently needs our help.
