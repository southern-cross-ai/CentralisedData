         was considered the most appropriate period for examination of future carbon prices. The first trading period of the EU ETS (which ran from 2005 to 2007) was designed as a pilot phase with different policy settings to the current EU ETS and the proposed carbon price mechanism — particularly in relation to the banking of permits and sectoral coverage.

         Underlying market prices for financial instruments, such as EU carbon permits, are better reflected by trend movements, rather than temporary price fluctuations. For this reason a 3 month moving average was applied to the data to look through temporary daily movements.

These businesses have experience in managing risk in relation to a range of factors such as variable electricity prices, commodity prices and exchange rates. As such, they are well equipped to manage a variable carbon price.
