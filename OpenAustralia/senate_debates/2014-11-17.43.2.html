        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to comments by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
         President Obama
        </a>
        that for Australia climate change means:

        … longer droughts, more wildfires. No nation is immune …
       </p>

        Does the minister agree?

         The government's position on climate change is well known and there is no need to rehearse that which the government has already announced and stated. But can I indicate that one of the reasons the government was so anxious to be able to come to an agreement on the Direct Action Plan was that we were committed to doing something for the environment which Labor and the Greens so steadfastly ensured we could not implement. Thanks to the crossbenchers, we were able to come to a landing on that and implement our Direct Action Plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         I respect the President of the United States of America, but can I simply say that when it comes to emissions and the promises made by relevant countries I just have a look at the promises made and then that which has actually been achieved. Australia is one of the very few countries in the world that can hold its head high and say that it will achieve the targets which it signed up to, unlike some other countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         So are we concerned to ensure that the least possible pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere? Of course we are. That is why we were so concerned to get our Direct Action Plan through the parliament, and thanks to the crossbenchers we have been able to achieve that.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         also say that at all times we have said that, as a country that emits less than two per cent of the world's emissions, we would watch this space very closely and would seek to walk in lockstep with other countries once they decided on a particular course of action. If events develop, as have been asserted, we will be closely monitoring them and ensuring that the right decisions are taken at the right time.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the Treasurer's comments that climate change is absolutely not an impediment to growth. I also refer to the G20 communique, which states that taking action on climate change supports economic growth and certainty for business and investment. Who is correct, the Treasurer or the G20 world leaders?

           Having listened closely to what the Senator said, I could not actually see a dichotomy or contradiction between the two comments or statements that the senator read out. Climate change does not have to be an impediment to economic growth. Climate change was mentioned in the communique. The communique talked about economic growth being of benefit to the world. So I indicate to Senator Bilyk that I see no conflict in the two statements as she has presented them to the Senate.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are concerned with ensuring that we do get proper economic growth in this country, because we are concerned about the 6.2 per cent of Australians that are unemployed and also the huge numbers that are underemployed. We want to provide them and the next generation with a genuine future.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer again to the G20 communique, which calls on member states to take strong action on climate change and to support adaption measures such as the Green Climate Fund. Will Australia be making a contribution alongside the United States, Germany, France and Japan?

             The Prime Minister has already spoken on this. As I understand the situation, he has indicated that he will not be making a contribution in circumstances where Australia, courtesy of the Labor legacy of which Senator Bilyk was part, is borrowing $1,000 million a month just to pay the interest on the existing borrowings. At this stage in time, it is appropriate, as the Prime Minister said, that we would watch this space very carefully, but at this stage we are not going to be making a commitment to the Green Climate Fund to which the honourable senator referred.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the world community comes to a landing on these issues then of course we will look very carefully and make the right decisions at the right time. But, Senator, you and your government left a sad legacy of deficit and debt.
