        , my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Investment, Senator Cormann. As the senator would be aware, in the 2010 blue book prepared for the potential incoming coalition government, the Treasury warned:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the potential benefits of [free trade agreements] under negotiation had been oversold and their negatives largely ignored.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Treasury then cautioned that the coalition should:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … avoid bindings that limit future domestic policy flexibility. Exercise caution in accepting … investor-state dispute settlement—
       </p>
       <p>
        commonly known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDS" rel="nofollow">
         ISDS
        </a>
        provisions. The Treasury has clearly issued a red flag to the government on free trade agreements, and it is warned not to risk our national sovereignty. Why is the government going against Treasury advice by including ISDS provisions in the TPPA and the Korean free trade agreement, and what safeguards is it putting in place to limit future litigation against the Australian people for simply creating legislation on their behalf?

        <p>
         I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for that question. The first point I would make is that I completely reject the assertion that we are going against Treasury advice. The government have a very simple commitment. Our commitment is to pursue policies that strengthen our economy and create jobs. To the extent that entering into free trade agreements helps us strengthen our economy and create jobs, we will pursue them; to the extent that it does not, we will not. That is a very, very simple equation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would make this more general observation: not having free trade agreements in place where the nations that we compete with do actually puts us at a serious disadvantage.

         of America, who we compete with in that market, in particular in relation to agricultural products, was taking significant market share away from Australian farmers. Why? Because it was able to access that market at much superior conditions than Australian farmers. So the point—

            This is actually a very important issue, and it is one that does need to be debated and argued across the Australian community in a responsible fashion, which is why I am actually going out of my way to give you a very genuine answer, Senator Whish-Wilson. The point here is this: we will only pursue free trade agreements that are in the national interest. We will only pursue free trade agreements that help us strengthen our economy and create jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to investor-state dispute settlement clauses, what we have said very clearly, what Minister Robb—who achieved outstanding success with Korea the other week, success that the previous government was not able to achieve during six years in government—has said very clearly is that we will only consider inclusion of those sorts of clauses on a case-by-case basis where, as part of an overall package, we consider the overall package to be in the national interest.
