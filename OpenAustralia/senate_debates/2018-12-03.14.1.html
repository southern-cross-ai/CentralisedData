The Clerk has advised me that that is consistent with past practice. Senator Collins.

What all senators in this place need clarification on is how this motion, circulated very late in the piece with no notice, no warning, no consultation, was that he would move that the limitation of debate of the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Removing Discrimination Against Students) Bill 2018 no longer operate. We determined this matter last Thursday. We went through the correct processes to do—

You've raised your point of order, which is: does the motion moved by Senator Cormann contravene standing order 87. Now, that motion cannot be ruled on, by the way, until Senator Cormann has had a chance to move the motion, which is why I wanted to give him an opportunity to actually move the motion.

                                      Hang on. You can't raise a point of order about a motion being outside the standing orders until the motion is moved. So I have sought the advice of the Clerk on this matter, and you were kind enough to provide me with your query earlier to allow me to seek advice from the Clerk, and the Clerk has said, again, consistent with past practice, the suspension of standing orders means that standing order 87 does not apply to prevent the moving of this motion and that that is also consistent with the past practice of the Senate. I wanted Senator Cormann to move it, because the point of order can only be raised after it is moved. Senator Collins.

                                                   kids, have walked in here and helped Senator Cormann put off a vote on a bill they reckon they support. And this is a bill that Mr Morrison supports. Let us be clear. The only reason why we have had the shenanigans we have just seen—no notice, coming in and upending the Senate, overturning the previous agreement of this Senate to vote on this legislation for which there was broad support in this chamber by 10 to two—the only reason Minister Cormann had to suspend standing orders and pervert the process of the Senate is because he's worried about the House of Representatives. He's worried about the survival of the government on the floor of the House of Representatives. He's lost control. This is an indication of the chaos that is the Morrison government. They upend the Senate to not vote on protecting LGBTIQ kids because they're so worried about the lack of control they have of the House of Representatives. Do you know what the decent thing to do would be? Call an election. Call an election, and stop perverting the processes of the Senate by voting against the position the Prime Minister had and trying to desperately avoid a vote in the House. Call an election instead of lying the way that you have about this issue through the Wentworth by-election and through this week. And shame on you, Senator Patrick, for doing this and aiding and abetting it.

The government put forward five very sensible amendments. Some of the crossbenchers indicated to us, in good faith, that they needed some more time to consider the issues that they raised.

What was in place was a guillotine to prevent the Senate from properly considering all of the issues. We are actually, as a government, facilitating the proper consideration of what is a very important issue. We do want to see this legislation passed, but we want to see it passed in an amended form. We thank the Senate for having made a sensible decision today and for having backed our judgement.

Three-quarters of the Australian community want to see discrimination ended in schools, full stop—no ifs or buts—and they want it to end now. The Prime Minister himself said, before the Wentworth by-election, that it was urgent to act to end discrimination now. Yet we have just seen this appalling use of Senate process. This bill has been pushed off into the long grass.

                                                     We had the opportunity today to change our laws for the better, so that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students would have been protected, would have felt safe and would have felt supported in their school communities regardless of what school they went to. But the appalling actions of this government, together with Centre Alliance—who have shown their true colours in what they are doing today—have meant that this opportunity is passing us by.

But the government, coupled with Centre Alliance, is not allowing this debate to occur and not allowing a vote to occur today. It is an absolute travesty and it is incredibly sad for those many people in our community—the same people who fought a year ago for marriage equality—who were hoping that, a year later, as part of the anniversary of marriage equality, we would act to end discrimination and support young people in all of our schools. But it is not to be, because of the outrageous actions of this government and the Centre Alliance senators.

Indeed, Senator Macdonald has misrepresented the comments that I made during my contribution on this bill. Let's be very clear about what process occurred. We moved to have these matters referred to a committee for a report and for an interim report, to allow the Greens' bill and, indeed, other proposals, such as the now government amendments, to be considered in detail. What this government then did was come into the chamber, in a deal with the Greens, and circumvent that time frame—so severely that we have received complaints from people who appeared before the Senate committee that they were asked to provide further information to the committee and the committee reported even before such information could have been received by the committee. That was the farce, that this government agreed with the Greens about how we deal with issues related to discrimination against students.

Now they're arguing we need more time. In the week before last they were arguing, 'Oh, no, we've got to do it right now,' and would not allow proper and due consideration. This is the chaos of the Morrison government. They cannot decide on a process that is legitimate, that is open, that is honest. Instead, we have the stunts, such as that we just received, where, with no notice, with—

It reflects the standing of the Morrison government and, indeed, reflects the position the former Prime Minister left this matter in. Let's try and deal with protecting religious freedom for the Australian community with more respect and with more dignity.

                                                               , I'll take the interjection from Senator McAllister. The will of the Senate has been expressed, and the government alone does not have the numbers in this place. Crossbench colleagues indicated that they desired to have additional time to consider this legislation. That is something that the government took into consideration; hence, Senator Cormann sought leave to move his motion in order to allow a substantive motion to provide additional time. This is a case of the government listening to what crossbenchers, in good faith, have expressed, of it putting that matter to the Senate and the Senate deciding that there should be additional time. That is what happened. As we see time and time again, those opposite are always happy to crow about the will of the Senate right up until the point that the Senate doesn't agree with them. Then the will of the Senate doesn't seem to count for much.
                                                              </p>

                                                               This is important legislation; we all recognise it's important legislation. We want to make sure that there are appropriate and reasonable safeguards, and the Senate has expressed its will that the time should be taken to make sure that that is the case. There should be no doubt at all about the desire of this government, the desire of this parliament, the desire of both chambers, to ensure that students are not ever placed in a situation where a school would see them not continue. We are all agreed with that. But it is important that there are appropriate safeguards for school institutions, so that they can go about their business, as we would all want them to. That is why Senator Cormann moved the motion that he did—in order to ensure that the Senate has the opportunity to properly discharge its responsibilities to examine the legislation carefully.

I want to go on record as saying I support the amendments by the Greens to this bill, that have now been abandoned, to ban discrimination by independent schools against any pupil on the grounds of their sexual orientation. I feel as fervently on the issue of discrimination against teachers, too. I am surprised and disappointed, but, after being so gung-ho about protecting gay teachers last week, the opposition dropped the second part from its bill when it got here. That is why I supported several important Greens amendments which I believe would have passed and could have passed. I'm not surprised that the government has abandoned teacher protection for now, because Prime Minister Morrison made it quite clear to me personally that that would not happen. The Libs also, of course, have watered down the gay student protection with some of their amendments today. Now, of course, they've kicked it all to the long grass, as somebody earlier said.

                                                                 I had a failed motion on this issue earlier this year, and another failed one that would have stripped discriminatory schools of any government funding or charity tax concessions. I still stand by that, although it failed. I suspect that the government and the opposition feared Catholic and Uniting school backlashes, even though neither has threatened, as far as I know, to expel a child or sack a teacher solely because of their sexual orientation.

How the hell do you explain that to a possibly troubled, insecure child? That's why what has happened here today is a bloody disgrace.
