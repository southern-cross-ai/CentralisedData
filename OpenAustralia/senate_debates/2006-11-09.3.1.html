         Purpose of the bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill contains provisions to implement Australia’s remaining obligations under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSFTA" rel="nofollow">
         AUSFTA
        </a>
        ) concerning intellectual property rights. It creates a liability scheme for certain activities relating to the circumvention of “effective technological measures”. These measures help protect copyright owners from piracy and will encourage the increased availability to consumers of copyright materials in digital form.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AUSFTA sets out a number of permissible exceptions to the liability scheme for:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         interoperability of software
        </li>
        <li>
         studying encryption technology
        </li>
        <li>
         testing security of computer networks
        </li>
        <li>
         identifying and disabling “spyware”
        </li>
        <li>
         security, law enforcement and similar governmental purposes, and
        </li>
        <li>
         access for acquisition decisions by libraries, archives and educational institutions.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The AUSFTA also provides for additional limited exceptions where the case for such an exception has been demonstrated. The bill amends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Copyright Act
        </a>
        1968 to give effect to the liability scheme and the exceptions. Additional limited exceptions will be included in the Copyright Regulations on a case by case basis. A number will be included as a result of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs “Review of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPM" rel="nofollow">
         TPM
        </a>
        Exceptions”.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also implements the outcomes of several copyright reviews conducted by the government in 2005-06, including the outcome of the “Fair Use Review” and the review of protection for encoded broadcasts. The bill also extends the jurisdiction of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">

Demand for access to IPND data continues to grow due to its recognition as an accurate and up-to-date source of information.
