                 Let me be clear about this: the Rudd government will invest $35.8 billion over six years to 2013-14 in road and rail, more than double what the coalition spent over a similar period. The $35.8 billion is made up of the Nation Building Program, $26.2 billion;
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARTC" rel="nofollow">
                  ARTC
                 </a>
                 , $1.2 billion; and new budget investments, $8.5 billion. We will be investing a record $6 billion in 2009-10 to build new transport infrastructure and upgrade existing transport infrastructure. This builds on our first budget in 2008-09, which delivered $5.9 billion. Over the six years to 2008-09, the coalition spent only $17.3 billion on road and rail through

                 and ARTC. So let us be clear: when it comes to infrastructure on road and rail—

The minister has not touched on that in any sense at all. He absolutely has not touched on it. Could you please direct him to answer the question and be relevant.

                     , I ask a supplementary question. Thank you very much for that information, Minister, but I note that you failed to touch on Tasmania once. Has the government held any direct discussions with the Tasmanian transport minister, Graeme Sturgess, since the collapse of the Tasmanian rail and freight network last Wednesday?

                        The Rudd Labor government have committed close to $200 million to improve Tasmanian rail infrastructure through our Nation Building Program. Minister Albanese is working constructively with the Tasmanian government to make sure that this investment delivers the best outcome for the state’s industries and communities. Those opposite crying wolf and crying crocodile tears in this area are again exposed. You are complete frauds. You cannot match—

Almost 50 per cent of the funding that is there now was put in place by the previous government and, for the information of Senator Sherry, the rail tracks in Tasmania are actually owned by the Tasmanian government.

                                    , I am speaking to two matters in respect of the point of order. The first matter is that it was raised as a point of order on relevance. In my submission, the minister was relevant to the question. He was talking specifically about funding of Tasmanian rail. The second matter I raise on the point of order, which in my submission you should rule out of order, is that it was not speaking to the point of order of relevance; it was in fact dealing with the question to try to correct it. I think in that sense it is impermissible.
