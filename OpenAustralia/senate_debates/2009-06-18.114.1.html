        My question is to Senator Ludwig, representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        . I draw the minister’s attention to a paper published in the April edition of the
        <i>
         Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry
        </i>
        relating to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The research was conducted by academics from the University of Nebraska and the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . The paper reports on a 16-year review of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        government data to identify a high variation in new cases of the prescription of psychostimulants, including amphetamines, to treat
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD" rel="nofollow">
         ADHD
        </a>
        , as well as higher prescription levels in lower socioeconomic suburbs—some as high as 12 per cent of children aged between five and 18 years. My questions are: is the minister aware of this longitudinal study? Is the minister aware of media reports of similar trends in the lower socioeconomic suburbs of Sydney, as well as other research that indicates such volatility in prescription rates between states and regions? If so, can the minister offer a response on behalf of the federal government as to why it believes that there is such a volatility in psychostimulant drug prescription for ADHD across states, cities and suburbs?

         I thank Senator Xenophon for his question. The department is aware of the article published in the
         <i>
          Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry
         </i>
         in April this year. The government would be very concerned if children are being inappropriately prescribed medication for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD" rel="nofollow">
          ADHD
         </a>
         —just as we would be concerned if children who needed medication were unable to get it. In terms of the lower socioeconomic areas of Sydney, the volatility and perhaps also the reasons for the volatility, the Australian draft guidelines on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were developed for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_College" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian College
         </a>
         of Physicians by independent scientific writers. The guidelines are based on a thorough review of current evidence and will provide advice on best practice in the management of ADHD across a broad range of possible interventions. Those are the guidelines that are currently in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         More than 70 submissions were received when the guidelines were released for public consultation. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be submitted to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
          NHMRC
         </a>
         for final approval in the coming months. The real issue, of course, is that if anyone is concerned about the medication that they or their children are taking they should speak to a doctor. I am not aware of an increase or otherwise in Sydney as a particular area. I am happy to seek additional information from the relevant minister, Minister Roxon, to see if she can provide any additional information. I can say that it is important for parents, teachers and doctors to have clear evidence based guidelines on appropriate management of the condition. That is exactly what the draft guidelines go to.

           ADHD

           I thank Senator Xenophon for his question. Of course, the government is always concerned about ensuring affordable access to health care for Australians, particularly those who have the least capacity to pay. They range from those people who are on low incomes right through to pensioners. That is why we do have the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
            Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
           </a>
           , and that is why the government will spend something in the order of $7 billion this year to subsidise more than 3,100 products through the PBS, covering around 80 per cent of prescriptions. The PBS is a co-payment and safety net arrangement to help to ensure that subsidised medicines are available for all Australians, and of course the government does provide additional assistance in some areas. In terms of seeking additional information about the particular part of your question—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister take those matters on notice? Given that the federal government has argued that the new national specific purpose payment arrangements will produce more accountability for the states with federal funding, what specific benchmarks will apply to improve state service provision to reduce the disproportionate number of poorer kids taking drugs for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD" rel="nofollow">
             ADHD
            </a>
            and the long-term implications for those children?

             Thank you, Senator Xenophon. I will take part of the issue that you have raised on notice. I can add that under the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
              Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
             </a>
             consumers can ask their doctors to prescribe a generic medication, and their pharmacist may be able to supply a less expensive brand. That is about always ensuring that all brands of the same medicine have the same active ingredients and have been tested by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
              Therapeutic Goods Administration
             </a>
             . Usually the only difference between one brand and another is the packaging, size and type. It is about ensuring that there are less expensive medicines available to ensure that groups who cannot afford it or who want the additional option can choose to balance their budget by choosing the less expensive, generic medications. The government is aware—
