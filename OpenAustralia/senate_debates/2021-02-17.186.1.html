             I'll just make a short contribution. This is a very, very modest change to a truly terrible bill. But, if, against the advice of all the experts, this bill is to pass the Senate, it's better that it passes with these amendments than without them. On that basis, Labor will be voting in favour of these amendments.

               Amendment (1) on the government's sheet of amendments, if enacted, would ensure that there would have to be at least 25 judges in Division 1 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. These amendments would marginally improve a terrible piece of legislation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's not forget that, when the Attorney-General first put forward a bill to merge the Federal Circuit Court and Family Court of Australia in the 45th Parliament, he explicitly stated that he intended not to appoint new judges to Division 1 as they retired. That would have amounted to a gradual abolition of Division 1 over time. Let's remember that Division 1 is what the existing Family Court will become if the government's legislation passes the Senate. The Attorney-General was forced to back away from that position in the 46th Parliament.
              </p>
              <p>
               Under its current iteration, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2019 would allow the Attorney-General to make a regulation to prescribe a minimum number of judges for Division 1, but nothing in the bill would require the Attorney-General to make any such regulation. The fact that the Attorney-General has stated publicly that he would prescribe a minimum of 25 judges is meaningless. The Morrison government commits itself to doing things all the time, and it almost never follows through.
              </p>
              <p>
               Amendment (1) on the government's sheet of amendments will ensure that the Attorney-General cannot crab walk away from his commitment to prescribe a minimum number of 25 judges for Division 1. But it would still allow the Morrison government to reduce the number of judges, in what will become Division 1, from 32 to 25. And I note that there is also a vacancy that has been created recently. We do not think that that is acceptable. That is why I have moved amendments to this amendment to prescribe a minimum number of 32 judges in Division 1 so that the number of judges in that division cannot drop below 32.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, even if our amendments to this amendment succeed, none of the changes to the bill that we are debating will address any of the fundamental problems with the legislation. The government's bill will still rob the Family Court of Australia of its essential distinguishing feature, which is that it is a court that deals only with family law matters. The government's bill will still do nothing to address any of the problems in the family law system, a system that the Liberals and Nationals have neglected for over seven years. The government's bill will still make an already bad situation even worse for Australian families. The government's bill will still, in the words of the Law Council, represent 'a terrible gamble with the lives of children and families'. But, in the event that this bill does pass the Senate, it is better that it passes with these amendments than without them.

                 I'm happy to rise to seek the support of my fellow senators for my amendments, particularly Senator Patrick, as he seems pretty keen to support this shoddy legislation on the condition that there is a minimum number of judges in the legislation. I want to be clear: I completely oppose the merging of these courts because, as the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services have made clear, this merger will not fix the root causes of the problems of the family law court. As at 17 February there are 32 judges currently listed on the Family Court's website, who would become Division 1 judges, not including the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Court_of_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  Family Court of Western Australia
                 </a>
                 judges. The government's amendment requiring 25 judges doesn't make any sense. It's going backwards from the current number of 32 judges. It does not make any sense to go backwards at this time, particularly to a figure of 25 in view of the crippling backlogs and workloads facing the courts.

                 made a statement in November 2019 that at least one extra judge is required in every major registry to make a massive difference to the backlog. That would make it at least 40 judges. The Chief Justice said, '"an extra judge in every major registry would make a massive difference" to backlogs'—quoted in Tony Keim, ‘A family (court) affair’.

                  will not be supporting the Greens' amendment on sheet 1207, with regard to increasing the judges from 25 to 40. I was involved in the committee that actually looked into the merger of the two courts. After hearing evidence that was given, and especially being involved as deputy chair in the Family Court matter presently on foot and the advice that we actually heard, yes, there is a backlog in the court system, and, yes, the judges are terribly overworked. Why I've come to the conclusion that I'm not going to support this is that it's not really more judges that we need; it's more registrars and their support staff that we need. It has been shown that by putting registrars and senior registrars into the positions they can actually triage, hear the mentions and even the contraventions of orders and do a lot of the work of the judges. They can actually even hear determinations. That has been supported by judges and the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
                   Chief Justice
                  </a>
                  and the Deputy Chief Justice.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'd like to point out to Senator Thorpe that by appointing judges into the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Courts" rel="nofollow">
                   Federal Courts
                  </a>
                  their appointment is until they're 70 years of age. They can't be sacked, unless they're sacked by both houses of parliament. That is rarely ever done. When you have registrars appointed, they can be utilised when needed in the court system, and we can bring in more or less. They are doing the work and helping the judges. A Federal Court judge in the Family Court Division 1 is basically costing the taxpayers approximately $500,000 a year. That is a huge cost to taxpayers. We found that a lot of these judges are stressed and a lot of them are overworked and that, hence, a lot actually take a lot of time away from their work because of this and they're still being paid, yet the work is not being completed—work which could be carried on by registrars.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  People do need to get their cases heard, but I truly do believe that instead of putting more money into judges—because in the Family Court their average of 27 judges heard approximately 500 cases a year, yet the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Circuit" rel="nofollow">
                   Federal Circuit
                  </a>
                  Court judges heard about 500 to 600 cases a year each—we need to look clearly at how we're going to do it. I do support the Attorney-General's move to a minimum number of 25 judges and the appointment of more registrars.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There has been a lot of streamlining that has been happening in the court system to actually address people's needs, and their submissions are being taken up under the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_Project" rel="nofollow">
                   Lighthouse Project
                  </a>
                  , which is working extremely well. I think the Attorney-General is doing an excellent job addressing the needs of the courts.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I must say that the Labor Party complains that the Liberal Party has done nothing in the last seven years. Well then, I'd ask the same question of the Labor Party: what have they done in their time when they were in parliament here? Absolutely nothing, because the increases happened. So it's alright to point the finger and have your say now on what the Liberal Party has done, but the Labor Party have in fact done absolutely nothing themselves.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is a way forward. I have been involved in this for many years and have raised the issues continually in this house. I have reviewed it, possibly more than any other member in this place, so I feel that I am very much across this and I am supporting the government's bill. I will not support the Greens' amendment to this.

                      That's correct, Senator Patrick. The number that has been specified in the amendment is a minimum floor. It's not to suggest that is going to be a fixed number at any time and it does represent an increase from zero under the current arrangements.

                       Senator Stoker, you participated in the Senate inquiry with me. You are obviously performing a different role here this evening. I'm wondering whether you recall the Senate being advised that there were five judicial vacancies at the moment, and that's not including the four additional positions that were announced in the budget. Can you seek some advice from the officers as to why those vacancies haven't been filled? In so doing, perhaps you could also advise the chamber why, when the Attorney-General is given significant notice of impending retirements, it has taken so long to fill the vacancies.

                        Senator Carr, I can answer that question. It is true that those vacancies exist, so your data is right on that front. They are not yet filled because a process is underway, which you would expect, Senator Carr, would be done with care and due consideration. These are important appointments. It's important we get them right. It is the case that the work is being done at the moment to fill those ones as soon as that process is complete.

                         I appreciate that the Attorney-General would be anxious to make sure he got the right appointments, but one could also be concerned that, if it takes a long time to fill vacancies—and we started from the premise that he didn't want to fill the vacancies at all—it does imply there is a lack of real motivation to fill vacancies. Obviously the circumstances suggest that the Attorney-General has had a long time to fill the vacancies. I ask you specifically: Does the Attorney-General intend to fill the vacancies? When will that occur? It's no good saying to me, 'I just have to make sure I get the right person.' It takes a bit more than that. Given the lack of certainty there has been about this Attorney-General's interest in maintaining the administrative efficiency of this court, how is it that it has taken so long to fill the vacancies that occurred?

                          Senator Carr, I'll clarify something I just said. You gave the total number of vacancies. That number is correct, although it should be clarified that most of those are in the

How many people have put their hand up to do that job and how long ago? Come on. If you've got nothing to hide, just give the numbers. This is getting ridiculous.

                                It's a process that's managed in consultation with the heads of jurisdictions, the chief justices and often in consultation with members of the representative bodies of the professions. It is a process that varies in the length of time that it takes depending on the complexity of those consultations. It doesn't have the usual recruitment time frame that you might have for hiring an office clerk or something of that nature, but it is the method that has always been used. It's a cabinet-in-confidence process and it is underway.

                                 Let me get this right. We have a problem in our courts but you can't tell me a time frame for the Attorney-General to pick a mate to put in the job. That's exactly how the process works. We all know how it works, so please didn't give me the run-around. The Australian people would like to know what the time frame is going to be for the Liberal Party or the Attorney-General to get these jobs filled. I think it's a fair question. I think it's a serious question. The people of Australia would like to know, especially those people—not like you, who have probably never been through the Family Court system—who have got kids who are feeling that pain. For goodness sake, just answer the question please!

These judges should be promptly replaced with new appointments to avoid exacerbating existing delays. Further, judges may also be required to work through COVID-19 backlogs in view of the court's reliance on audiovisual link hearings since March 2020.

                                    's intention to retire came prior to the prescribed age of 70. When there is a retirement that is out of the ordinary expectation—and I guess it is a little earlier than expected—there's sometimes a little more time required for that to be filled. That process is underway. I don't expect it's far. We are taking every step we can to make sure that those appointments are as timely as possible, because, like you, we appreciate that they are important to getting through the critical work of the court.

                                     I thought it was probably important that Labor outline our position in relation to the Greens amendments. Labor supports these amendments on the basis that this parliament should always be calling on the government to increase resources to a family law system that this government has starved of resources. Of course, the way in which additional resources can be allocated most efficiently is a fundamentally important question. Labor does not support this bill. We do not support the new court structure the government has put forward, so Labor has not considered whether increasing to 40 the number of judges in Division 1 would, if this were to pass the parliament, be the best way of allocating additional resources. This does not represent Labor policy. Our commitments that we take to the Australian people will be considered in the usual way and will be made public before the next election. However, we support this amendment because, at the very least, that is a matter that this government should be required to consider.

                                           So let me be clear on this. The government announced an additional four positions nearly a year ago. It hasn't filled them. That's the case? I want to be clear so that I understand. You announced them a year ago in the budget and haven't filled them, and we're about to go into the next year's budget. When you say there are four vacancies, does that include the four that were announced in the budget last year, or is the real number in fact eight?

                                             So it's arguable that there are in fact eight vacancies, if there are four that were announced last year plus the four from vacancies because of retirements. If we were to take the government at its word, announced in the budget last year, there are going to be four additional spots. They haven't been filled, so surely it is arguable that there are eight vacancies.

                                              That's right. The only caveat on that is to say that we can't fill the four new ones until we have certainty on the ability to fund them.

                                               I find it an extraordinary proposition that a government with a budget the size of the Commonwealth of Australia's can't fill four judges' vacancies. I say that in the context of evidence presented to the Senate inquiry into this bill—which surely, Senator Stoker, you were surprised by—that pointed out that judges of the

                                               Court were dealing with an average of some 330 matters each and pointed out the size of the average document. You'd understand these terms far better than I would. I'm not one of these legal eagles, but I do find the fact that you'd ask an average judge to have 330 cases each—one judge had 600 cases, eight judges had more than 500 cases each, 26 judges had more than 400 cases each and 41 judges had more than 300 matters each. As I say, I'm not claiming to be a lawyer, but it strikes me as an extraordinary amount of work for individual judges. There is surely a very strong case to say that this court is overburdened and that one of the consequences of that for families who are having to face the misery of going before the Federal Circuit Court is that they are having to wait years to have their matters heard. Can you confirm those figures that I've given you? Is it the case?

                                               Secondly, why is the Attorney-General so unwilling to fill these vacancies—which, on my argument, are eight vacancies at the moment—given the extraordinary workload that exists for the judges that are currently sitting? Finally, would this not lead to a situation where we'll get even more resignations, because of the workload pressures on the court itself?

                                                Thank you, Senator Carr. There are a few things in that question. The first thing to say is that, broadly speaking, your estimates of which judges have how much on their dockets—in the answer to your question on notice that was provided to you a little while ago—is right. I don't accept the premise of your question that says there is no intention to fill these vacancies. There is a process underway for the four retirement based vacancies to be filled, and they are in the process of being selected and appointed through the ordinary cabinet-in-confidence method.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                The next matter to deal with is what is driving those retirements. There's no evidence to suggest that those who have retired have done so because they were unhappy with the workload that they had, and I'm the first person to recognise that the judges of the
                                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Circuit" rel="nofollow">

                                                Court are extremely hardworking. They will be assisted in that workload when they have more colleagues with which to share that load. That's why we are in the process of filling those vacancies.

                                               <p>
                                                It is worth noting, though, that the Federal Circuit Court at present operates a docket system, and that means, as you know, Senator Carr, each case is allocated to a particular judge who manages it from its commencement through to disposition. So, while one might have several hundred matters on their docket, it doesn't mean they all have to go to trial and all require a judgement. Many of those either settle or are dealt with in an ex tempore or immediate moral reasoning or judgement. It's only the case that a mere 15.5 per cent are ultimately judicially determined, in the sense that they get a final ruling. Of those, many are dealt with in the much faster ex tempore immediate moral reasoning method, rather than having to reserve a judgement and do the work that's associated with preparing a written judgement.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                The point is that there is great variation in the amount of burden that each of those cases presents. Some are quite small; some are much larger. So, while there is variation in those numbers, they aren't always comparing apples and apples, if I might use that expression.

So I'd ask you, Senator Stoker: what was the deal that the Attorney-General did with Senator Patrick in exchange for Senator Patrick's support for this bill? Specifically, what is the deal in regard to additional resources for the family law system, and in which state will those resources be deployed?

It means that ordinarily, as a matter of the management of the court, there is a practice of having one judge that looks after a single matter throughout, but it's not exclusive and sometimes there are exceptions to the rule; it is just a general practice.

I want to know how chaotic it is when you go to Fair Work before you get to court—that case is mine—and you have six judges over three years. Don't you tell me that our courtrooms are not in chaos. There is something terrible going on. I wouldn't be the only one. How many other cases are out there where there have been more than two judges over a period of time to do a court case?

You said that the deal between the Attorney-General and Senator Patrick was outlined in your summing-up statement. I'm wondering if you could be a little bit more specific for us. I thought I heard what you were saying there but I don't recall any detail being expressed on the issue of resourcing. So if I could ask you again: what is the commitment of the government in terms of extra resourcing for the family law system as a result of the arrangements you have entered into with Senator Patrick?

The President of the Law Society of Tasmania, Trevor McKenna, told the newspaper that he had raised the matter directly with the Attorney-General before the judge retired, and yet no replacement has been appointed. Let me quote directly:
                                                                   </p>

                                                                   </p>

                                                                   </p>

Why is it that this level of discrimination occurs so that you can buy a vote in this chamber?

Do you think it will be before the next election, before Christmas or before Easter next year? There's a bit of a bog going on down there, so how long do you think these families, if you don't mind showing them respect, will have to wait for that judge to be replaced?

If the Attorney-General doesn't have time, if the Attorney-General can't do it in a timely fashion, then let the legal people in Tasmania pick the judge themselves. Can that be done since you can't tell me the steps that you have to take, anyway, to pick one? Why don't you just let the people of Tasmania do that?

Minister, you're not willing to tell the Senate the total price of this deal, but I'm going to take a rough stab that a judge's salary is $300,000 or $400,000 a year, possibly more. So for three judges and a registrar, we're looking at another million or two dollars on top of the $14.3 million. So the total cost of this deal with Senator Patrick to obtain his vote and his support is certainly more than $15 million.

But I actually want to go back to what I thought was a pretty extraordinary admission, if I heard you correctly, Minister, in an earlier contribution that you made. I'll phrase it as a question to you in case I have misheard you or misunderstood you.

If I'm accurate and I've understood you correctly, I will have a response. But is that right?

But the work that they do is related to migration, so, strictly speaking, their workload won't be in the family space that is addressed in this bill, though it should be said that the vacancies of attrition have a relevance to these family matters. But it is true to say that it is absolutely relevant to the funding of those additional migration Federal Circuit Court judges that there is a fiscal responsibility in the way that we operate that court, and that means that the fees associated with, for instance, filings for migration cases will be applied to cover costs associated with dealing with migration cases, such as the costs associated with those judges.

That's the way you should be funding new judges. You don't need to increase fees by nearly 500 per cent in migration matters, pricing a whole cohort of people out of the justice system—some of whom, I might add, are denied work rights by your government, and many of whom have been recently or over the last two or three years cut off income support by your government. They've got no money, they are begging for food, and the charity and refugee sector have had to step up to feed and house these people because you treat them like they are criminals, like they are dogs. But they are actually people, human beings, with children and families, and your government's actions have resulted in them getting kicked out on the street. Many of them can't work because you won't give them work rights. Many of them don't have income because you cut them off our social security system. And now you want to increase their filing fees by 500 per cent. I've got an idea: fund the new judges straight out of the consolidated fund.

What we've learned tonight—and I think this is the first time this has actually been on the record—is that these new four judges' positions will be funded from the government's proposed fee increases in migration matters, which are now the subject of a disallowance motion moved by Senator Griff. I will have some follow-up questions, but can I just confirm that that is correct?

As part of the 2020-21 budget, the Morrison government is providing $35.7 million in funding to provide additional judicial and registrar resources, primarily for the Federal Circuit Court's migration jurisdiction but also in the family law jurisdiction.
                                                                                            </p>

I'll give you some precision, Senator Watt, since it has peaked your interest. That will support an additional three general federal law judges—when I say 'general federal law' I'm talking about the migration work predominantly—accompanied by two additional registrars, and one additional family law judge, which makes up the four, accompanied by five additional registrars, as well as serving to increase the base funding for the court. This increase in judicial and registrar resourcing will allow the court to resolve more matters every year, which will assist in addressing the backlog in migration matters and reduce the time families with family law matters spend before the courts after separation.
                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                             The additional resourcing is offset by an increase to the application fees, which I referred to a moment ago, for migration litigants in the Federal Circuit Court. As I mentioned a moment ago, currently the Federal Circuit Court application fees for migration matters are significantly lower than the fee that is imposed, for instance, in the AAT. This change will adjust the Federal Circuit Court application fee from $690 to $3,330 so that it is set at the midpoint between the fees in the lower AAT and the higher Federal Court fee. We'll continue to make sure that applicants have access to the court system by maintaining a full fee exemption where paying the fee would result in financial hardship, and it will be accompanied by a new partial fee exemption set at half the full rate, which will deal with many of the circumstances referred to in the commentary given by Senator McKim a little bit earlier.
                                                                                            </p>

Importantly, the revenue from that change, as I said at the outset, is being reinvested in the courts to improve the efficiency and the experience of court users, including to provide assistance for families navigating a separation and for applicants of migration matters.

All of the things that I set out in the summing-up speech are additional resources that come as part of a package for this bill. You will notice when you review the summing-up speech that the additional judge for a location yet to be determined is listed in those items. I don't see how I can make it any clearer than already provided.

So I want to make it very clear that the measures that have been announced by the Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General today are measures that I had talked to and advocated to the Attorney-General two years ago. This is not something that was come to overnight. I, as a South Australian senator, will always advocate for South Australia, and I'll point out that there's nothing that stops Senator Watt from wandering over to the Attorney-General's office and advocating for the registry in Brisbane, if he chooses to. Unfortunately, he's bound by party lines. If you look at the Constitution—I know you know it, because you are a very learned lawyer, Senator Watt—you will note that in the Constitution we don't have parties. We don't have parties in the Constitution; we have senators that represent their states. What you may have done in failing to advocate for Queensland is put your party ahead of your state.
                                                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                                                    I proudly stand here and say that I have advocated for my state to deal with an issue that I know has caused difficulties for the community in South Australia—that being a lack of resources in South Australia. Please do not stand up in the chamber, Senator Watt, and suggest there is anything wrong with a South Australian senator advocating for resources for South Australia. I make it very, very clear: I made this arrangement with the Attorney-General in the last parliament; this is not an overnight thing. I've been advocating for this for well over two years, and I'm very grateful that the government has listened to my advocacy. I've presented my case, and the Attorney has listened and granted these resources. Try it. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Watt is a Queensland senator, but—as far as I'm aware, and he can stand up and tell me if I'm wrong—he hasn't gone to the Attorney and sat down with him and said: 'This is what I'd like for Brisbane. This is what I'd like to have happen in the Brisbane registry.' He doesn't, because he's got to comply with his party guidelines. So I just wanted to clarify that in relation to the advocacy that I've done for South Australia for some time.

I might point out that, throughout this entire process, I've been engaging with Mr Dreyfus in the other place. They've been respectful conversations. I won't go to the nature of those conversations, but, in almost every conversation I've had with him, I've asked him what the alternative arrangements would be. You revealed tonight, Senator Watt, that you don't have alternative arrangements; you're going to make those arrangements public just prior to the next election. I wanted to see what the alternative might have been to the government's proposition, and the Labor Party would not tell me. In your speech on the second reading—I listened very carefully to it, Senator Watt—you advocated the

He has accused me of failing in my duties to the people of Queensland. I, of course, would argue that, by opposing this bill, as all Labor senators are doing, that's how I'm fulfilling my duties to the Queensland public. This is bad law that will make family law matters worse for people who are already struggling with a failing system. Unfortunately, Senator Patrick does not have the same principled position on this that Labor senators and, indeed, other crossbench senators do as well. But, if he wants to ignore his principles and do a deal with the government, that's a matter for Senator Patrick.

I would expect that the minister would be advocating heavily for the needs of Queensland registries. Is the minister aware, for instance, that the average time between the date on which a matter is filed and the date on which judgements are being delivered in Adelaide is currently 20.2 months, whereas in the Rockhampton registry it's 21.3 months, and in Brisbane it's 23.8 months? Minister, as a senator for Queensland, why is it then that the Adelaide registry is receiving additional resources when Brisbane and Rockhampton, for example, have bigger workload issues and longer delays for applicants in the court?

Indeed, there is funding approved as part of the most recent budget, as a consequence in particular of the advocacy of Queensland senators from the coalition side, for upgrades to and improved and safer facilities in, for instance, the Rockhampton registry. I don't accept the premise of your question. There are enormous investments being made in Queensland.

In Cairns it takes 41.2 months, well over three years, to have a family law matter finalised, yet the government decides to invest additional resources in Adelaide. What's so bad about Cairns? Why doesn't Cairns deserve the same as Adelaide when the wait is more than double the wait in Adelaide?

There can be a tendency for distortion in some of the statistics. For instance, there are some matters that can be finalised quickly because they are simple matters; some matters are quite complex. There's also inconsistency between different judges as to whether they tackle the tough ones first and get those reserved judgements out first or whether they deal with some of the smaller fish and leave those more difficult ones on the shelf to be dealt with after the little ones. In Cairns, there was a practice of the judicial officer dealing with the simpler matters first. I'm pleased to say that the Chief Justice is actively tackling that right now to make sure that the position of Cairns will be even better because those longer, tougher ones are being tackled.

So again I ask you: why is the Cairns registry not getting the increase in resourcing that we're seeing in Adelaide? Is it because there's no Independent senator from Cairns who is prepared to sell out their principles and do a deal with the government in the way that Senator Patrick has?

Right? You understand that? The very fact that the statistics for Cairns show that in the six months to 1 January 2021 the matters that are concluded have the figure 41.2 shows that there has been an active, strategic and careful tackling of the oldest cases to clear them out, to make sure that there is resolution of those matters instead of letting them hang around. The people of Cairns should be comforted to see that spike in numbers because it means the oldest, longest cases are cleared rather than hanging around.

In that context, we have the Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General, who is a Queenslander.

I wonder how many times he's picked up the phone and taken advantage of the fact that you're a Queenslander and a minister in that portfolio. He clearly has particular concerns. How many times has he picked up the phone and advocated for Queensland with you about that issue?

A lot of misperceptions have been thrown around the chamber. Labor is asking what deals have been done. The fact is that Senator Patrick has actually got an extra judge or registrar or whatever. Good on him. Good luck to him. No problem. I remember talking to former Prime Minister Turnbull. To get the backpacker tax through, the Greens were given $100 million for Landcare. Also, for Senator Lambie's vote for the tax cuts there was $150 million that went towards housing in Tasmania. Good on them. No problem. Our job here is to stand up for our states.

None. Zilch. Nothing. That is because I didn't ask for them. I believe in this policy and I have called for a merger of these two courts. The family law courts need to be addressed, and that's exactly what has been done here. You're playing politics, because you're not really looking at facts and you have not been involved in understanding what is happening in our family law system.

Registrars are doing this by undertaking many high-volume duty lists, as well as interim and interlocutory disputes, and by undertaking dispute resolution in both property and parenting disputes. There is a program at the moment, the registrar assistance pilot.

Because of COVID they had extra cases put on, but they've cleared those cases and also cleared about 13 or 15 per cent of the backlog. I mentioned before the

That is streamlining by merging the two courts. You have two sets of rules and two sets of processes. This is merging them all into the one process, which is easier for the Australian people who are going through the system.

They take over seven months in the Family Court and 6.9 months in the Federal Circuit Court to be heard. They hope now to address those within 14 days. If we're honest with ourselves, it's not just the judges. There are a lot of other things that need to be addressed if we're going to make improvements in the family law courts. Yes, families have had to wait a long time to have their hearings. The Federal Circuit Court deals with 90 per cent of the cases that are heard.

When I was here in the other place in 1996 I was talking about family law matters. Nothing whatsoever happened over the years. This is why I have been so involved in this whole matter.

I do believe that it is going to help the people of Australia. Stop playing politics in this place and look at what is right for the Australian people. I'm sick and tired, and so are the people of Australia. We're fed up with you knocking something purely because you're on the opposition bench.

People are suffering, families are suffering, kids are suffering and all you're worried about is your job in this place. It's about standing up and representing the Australian people the best we can. We should come to a decision that is going to be beneficial to them and solve their problems, because, through the family law system, too many kids are being dragged away from their families, too many people are suiciding and too many people are being murdered in this country. This is part of the way of dealing with this and helping those families. It is not just the mums and dads; it is the grandparents and extended families. I heard that through the whole inquiry we've gone through. This is a start to mending the problems that we have. It is about time that, instead of nitpicking and carrying on with politics, we actually tried to agree together on what is best for this and started working for the Australian people.

I look at the diagram, and, at the very bottom of it, it talks about a single point of entry for all family law matters.

Then it talks about a 'Division 1', which is the former Family Court of Australia, original jurisdiction. Then it shows an appeal division, which is the former Family Court appeals jurisdiction. Appeals from the 'Family Law Appeal Division' go to the High Court. That's exactly what is being done in this bill. So, Minister, unless I've got this wrong, this is actually the model that is being implemented by this bill. Is that not the case? Isn't it effectively the very model that Senator Watt advocated for in his second reading contribution?

It is substantially the same as what is being proposed in this bill. I'll highlight the similarities and differences, if that's of some assistance. The model that is proposed in the 2.0 model does involve a single point of entry, and there is a single point of entry in what is contained in this bill. There are two divisions, just as in the 2.0 model, although it is slightly differently structured so that it's not necessary for all

The different structure that's been used avoids that inconvenience or that administrative consequence. In relation to family law appeals, the 2.0 model envisaged a separate appeal division, whereas there is an ability to appoint either a full court or a single judge to hear appeals in Division 2, and, again, appeals to the High Court are in the usual way. So there are remarkable similarities between the

Though it is worth noting that, in what I understand was 2010, the then Labor government proposed a bill based on this model. It was really not all that different to the bill that is before this chamber, and it represents some irony that we are arguing at length today.

But can I just firstly deal with this issue around the 2.0 model. As the minister says, there are some similarities. One of the main differences is that the 2.0 model is a specialised model. It is proposed by people who are experts in this field, and we take the advice of those stakeholders who are working in this field day in, day out, dealing with family violence matters. That's the model that they have proposed, and it is different from the government's model, the model that you're voting for tonight, because it's substantially supported by stakeholders. The government's model is opposed by those organisations. That matters. It counts for something, because those people are the one whose are dealing with this on a daily basis.

Senator Hanson comes at this with some justification, and some of the things that she talks about—the stress that people go through and the terrible conflict that is created through the family law system—are certainly relevant, and no-one is discounting that. I said in my speech today, and I will call it out if the minister won't, that, when Senator Hanson makes comments that imply that somehow the family law system is the reason why people commit family violence, those comments are wrong. They are wrong, and they should be called out every single time that she says them. It says a lot about this government and this minister that they don't call out those comments, because family violence—

Until this moment, I haven't heard the same comments from the minister. I will withdraw and allow the minister to have that opportunity once I ask my question.

It's an important component of the support that we see from that side of the chamber around these changes. Somehow they think that they can use family violence as a justification to make changes to the Family Court. It's just not right and it does need to be called out.

We know that in Cairns there is an acute waiting problem. It's an example that's been used, and I'm sure that there are other registries that are problematic. I have met with the North Queensland Women's Legal Service on many an occasion. The No. 1 thing that they wanted to talk to me about the first time I spoke to them was their concerns about this merger bill and their concerns about the length of time that it's taking to get matters heard through the Cairns registry. What we have heard tonight is that there will be resources delivered to the registry in

Senator Green has made a comment that, in my remarks tonight, I said family violence is the reason why we are supporting the merger of the two courts. At no point in my speech tonight or ever on the floor of this parliament have I referred to family violence as a reason for supporting the merger of the two courts. I want a withdrawal.

Given that there will be resources going to the Adelaide registry when we know that the Cairns registry is in acute need of resources, it has been starved of resources and there are acute waiting times, have you as a Queensland senator, or in your position now, met with the Women's Legal Service Queensland about this bill and did you give them a reassurance that this bill would reduce waiting times in Cairns?

So there's been a significant improvement demonstrated on the current numbers. So I will rely on my previous answer there.

Interestingly, the level of expertise at present in the Family Court is actually lower, in the sense that the practitioners that have been appointed to that court are not exclusively family law practitioners. So in many ways this represents, at worst, the same level of specialisation and, at best, the opportunity for improvement.

Because the internal family law services are shared between the courts, they are already identical. So, again, there's no expectation that there will be a decline in wraparound services for those needing them, particularly in family violence cases, and one can expect no adverse impact on specialisation. Indeed, at this point in time, we have better specialisation in the Federal Circuit Court than we do in the Family Court.

That is indeed what I do. I know that she does work actively in her community. I might put on the record that I attended all of the hearings in the last parliament in relation to this bill, which caused it to be substantially changed, basically to the form that it is now. But even over the last couple of weeks, I have spoken to people from the Law Council, I've spoken to justices of the court, I've spoken to community legal services, and I have spoken, indeed, to the

I won't go to the details of the conversation with the Chief Justice, but I asked them to guide me in whether or not this bill would help them, and the impression that I walked away with was that it would.
                                                                                                                                                     </p>

Indeed, I also recall having a conversation with the assistant minister outside the chamber just recently about this bill as well.
                                                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                                                      There are two parts of what you need to do. You need to listen to the community and then you need to actually go to the people in power. That's a different prospect to probably what happens normally, where you go to caucus and you complain and you work up tactics and all those sorts of things. That's not how you successfully advocate for your state. What you do is you pick up the phone and say, 'I would like to speak to the Attorney-General. I'm a senator for Queensland.' I am sure that you would get an audience. That's how you properly represent your state.
                                                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                                                      So I might ask the same question of the assistant minister, who is a Queenslander, so no doubt shares lots of common views. I would ask the assistant minister: how many times has Senator Green wandered up to you and sought a meeting in respect of court-related matters in Cairns?

I can't remember the name of the senator who raised this issue, but, just to bring this to the notice of the house, in the specialised court they actually do have special areas. If people have concerns about attending the court, they notify the court and security guards go outside and escort them into the courthouse. There is a section for men to sit and there is a section for women to sit. There's also a special area that people, men or women, can go to if they're very concerned or traumatised or they have any problems. We are addressing those concerns. The merger of the two courts is not—if Women's Legal Services is raising as a concern that the merger of the two courts shouldn't go ahead purely based on safety, nothing's going to change; whether we leave the system the way it is now or whether we merge the two courts, it is not going to change. But they have been addressing the concerns of any Australians, men and women, who are faced with domestic violence to ensure their safety, and they provide that safety to them.

You've got nothing else to add to that? Is that it, the bare bones, for that $14.3 million? You haven't actually gone any further than that? If you can't answer that, maybe you can get up and reply to me, if that's okay, through the chair, Senator Patrick, what you are hoping to achieve out of that $14.3 million that you're getting for the pilot program?

But the purpose for which it is to be applied is for legal assistance for a need that has been identified and brought to us by Senator Patrick. He's evidenced the need for it, and that's why the action has been taken.

But, after consultation with stakeholders, one of the areas that is lacking in the Family Court area, particularly for those that need legal aid, is that they often go to legal aid and get assistance up until the point when they're basically listed to go to court and, in those circumstances, what happens then is the person who's been supported, in essence, gets cut loose. They either have to appoint a lawyer or a barrister or self-represent. This is not in any way disparaging of any self-representing litigant. Often they are forced because they have no other alternative. So one of the things I have talked to the Attorney about is the ability to perhaps look at funding beyond the advice stage into the court stage, and that has direct application in respect of this bill, because one of the aims of this bill is to streamline processes. Again, with no criticism of any self-represented litigant, but they can tie up the court because of their lack of expertise. I know they're only doing it because they have to. This may be an avenue. As I said, the details are not sorted out, but the general principles are that we can perhaps extend this, and that's why it is a pilot. You will have heard the Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General talk about a pilot to work out whether or not, by spending money in that area, we can actually assist people and, at the same time, reduce delays in the court.

I want to confirm that my discussions with the government in relation to the AAT have mostly centred on my concerns about appointees. You might recall that on 1 August 2019 I moved a motion in the Senate relating to the AAT, calling on the federal government to urgently introduce a bill into the parliament to repeal section 7(3)(b) of the act, which is the section that allows attorneys on both sides to appoint people—some might call them mates; others might call non-legally qualified people—to the AAT. Do you know what? There will be silence in the chamber right now because both sides have made questionable appointments to the AAT. I put that to a vote, and I'm looking the

Those are my most recent discussions in public and in this place in relation to the AAT. Sadly, I was advocating for a change, recommended by no less than Justice Callinan, who had done a review into the AAT, to remove that particular provision that allowed those sorts of appointees. I'm of the strong belief that, in order to be in the AAT, you really do need to be qualified, not because someone, one of your friends, has influence in this building. I just wanted to put that on the record. From memory, that's my last dealing with the AAT, with the government and with the Labor Party. Unfortunately, in both instances, I was not supported.

I have been saying in this place for a long time that we need to do something about the family law courts to address the needs and concerns of many Australians and their extended families. But it's about the children.

This legislation can only improve it even further, and yet you are still so reluctant to admit that you have got it wrong. The whole debate is not about domestic violence. Senator Green tried to bring up that I've used domestic violence as a reason for supporting the merger of the two courts. I never once mentioned it on the floor of the parliament.

The fact is that we do need to work together, and I've said this before: it is about the Australian people; it is not about us.
