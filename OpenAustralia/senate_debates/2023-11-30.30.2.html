          is developing a habit of jamming through, with undue haste, legislation that is extremely complicated and extremely consequential to the lives of many Australians. In particular, we need to understand why the Labor Party is not actually requiring the gas corporations to pay their fair share of tax so that those revenues can then be used to do things like put dental into Medicare and other measures that the

           On the amendment moved by Senator McKim: the government won't be supporting this amendment, although I understand perhaps an agreement has been reached with the Opposition and the Greens on both of these bills.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government will argue, certainly on the PRRT bill, that this is an important budget repair bill. It's important that it passes this Senate not only to provide the certainty that the sector has been seeking around arrangements but also to support the budget repair that the government has been working on for some time now, since coming to government, and it contributes to that over the forward estimates. I don't believe it is as complex as Senator McKim would argue. It clearly puts in place the arrangements going forward, but, importantly, it brings forward revenue into the forward estimates for budget repair.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the Help to Buy scheme, I think we again see an alliance between the Greens and the Liberal Party on measures and legislation that we are trying to pass through this chamber to improve people's access to affordable housing. This is an important commitment we took to the election. We've negotiated it with the states. There's been agreement at National Cabinet to progress this legislation. And now, similarly to what happened with the HAFF bill, we see the Greens and the Liberal Party trying to slow this down. You can't on the one hand attack the government over rents and housing and then, at the same time, slow down legislation that we are seeking to pass here so that people can get access to cheap mortgages and get into the housing system from the rental system. That's what Help to Buy will deal with—it will help people who have been unable to purchase a house get into the housing ownership market.
          </p>
          <p>
           This legislation, again, is not complex. It is pretty straightforward in aiming to establish a scheme that has been operating in the states for some time and has proven to be very successful in delivering those outcomes. We get that the Liberals and the Greens want to gang up on matters about housing and then go out and campaign on that, but here is a piece of legislation that very clearly creates access to the housing market for people who, for whatever reason, are currently locked out.

           wants to move into this space. We agree that the Commonwealth should provide leadership on housing, as we've been doing through Minister Collins's work, through establishing the HAFF and through all of the other arrangements that we're putting in place.
          </p>
          <p>
           But, by delaying the legislation, kicking it off to April and not having it dealt with, instead of coming back and dealing with it in the first sessions of next year, we're saying 'no' to potentially 40,000 applicants under a Help to Buy scheme being able to access affordable mortgages and enter the housing market. It's just nonsensical that the Senate would be standing in the way of that. We've got legislation in the House. It could easily be dealt with. The schemes have been operating. Talk to your state colleagues about how they're working, but please don't stand in the way of the government making progress in the area of housing.
          </p>
          <p>
           We've seen it with the HAFF. It delayed the HAFF by months and months. We expect it from those opposite—the 'no-alition'. We've come expect it from the Greens on housing, which is extraordinary. But please consider what you're actually doing out there, which is preventing thousands of Australians out in the suburbs in your communities from being able to access affordable mortgages through the Help to Buy scheme. It's a good scheme. It works; it's been proven to work. The states and territories are behind it. The first ministers and the Prime Minister have agreed on arrangements to put this in place. And then the Senate and the coalition—or the 'no-alition', which has been building up on a number of different measures on legislation in this place—are standing in the way of thousands of Australian families being able to enter the housing market. There is no logical argument for it other than that you want to delay, point-score and campaign but you don't actually want to be part of any solutions to fix the decade of delay and neglect that we inherited from those opposite on housing policy.

            First of all, I put on record that we will be supporting the Greens' amendments to this

            </a>
            report. I find it quite extraordinary that the minister opposite would come in here and deny this place its actual role. This is the place of review. Today, we've seen the government try to push for these two bills to be reported on by February, throughout a period when we're hoping that some people in this place may have the opportunity to spend some time with loved ones. Instead, the government want senators, in the family-friendly environment that they've created here, to work through the Christmas break and January so that the government can get these bills through committee inquiries in an expedited time. Given the time-critical nature of these particular bills, all we're talking about is probably seven or eight weeks to enable two really important committees of this parliament to have the opportunity to fully scrutinise bills which the minister herself has said are extremely important. If they are so extremely important, what is the problem with providing a little bit of extra time to enable the committees to do their job, to do it fully and to report back to this place?
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the things that has become part of the track record of this government is that they rush things through and then we have to go back later to fix up the mess. In fact the bills we are currently debating in this place, that Senator Paterson has been putting through this place this week, are an absolute classic example of making haste too hastily. If you'd bothered to take the time to get it right in the first place, or if you took the opportunity to start the process when the process was flagged that it should have been started, then some of these things could have been expedited in a more timely fashion.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the things that we will not do as a coalition, we will not allow the government to rush things through this place when the consequences often have an impact on Australians. That's because this government don't always get it right because they're in such a hurry to fix a problem. It seems a completely and utterly reasonable thing for these bills to be referred until April, as has been done by the Greens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another part of their other track record that we are seeing here is this complete and utter aversion to any transparency at all. One of the big problems we see with a lot of the legislation that comes in here is it's all very high level, it's all very 'frameworky' but there is no detail in it. Time and time again we see legislation with so little detail and so much left to the delegated legislation, which they will not show you until after the bill has been passed. The opportunity for the committees to flush out some of this lack of detail that's contained in the legislation is one of the most important processes of Senate committees. What the Greens have done here, and what we are going to support—we're calling out the government and saying: 'You need to provide greater transparency. You need to let some sunlight shine on your legislation because of your refusal to provide the detail of much of the legislation.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Once again, lack of consultation means legislation often isn't developed properly. So instead of us having to come in here and clean up your mess after the mess has been created, we think we should do what this place is supposed to do, as the house of review of this parliament, and have a thorough look at it in the first place. Let's get everything right. Let's make sure that if there are amendments that need to be put to any of this legislation, we have the opportunity for the stakeholders to have their say. Because you know what? Policy that is not informed by the people it impacts is policy that is invariably poor.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we're asking this place to do and what we're asking the chamber to vote for is to have adequate time so that we can scrutinise what this government doesn't want scrutinised. Every single time we see any bill of any consequence, it is pushed through here with great speed. And it seems almost ironical, doesn't it, that the very day we have sat in this place and guillotined one of the most important pieces of legislation for my home community in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            and many communities up and down the length and breadth of the Murray-Darling Basin, the government want to truncate the time that is available for this place and for a very important Senate committee to actually scrutinise these bills. We're starting to see a really troubling track record here from those opposite: they come in here, they push their way through and they try to deny scrutiny. And if they don't get their own way, they guillotine it. We will support the Greens amendment because we believe in transparency.

                  The Digital Identity Bill may be the most significant piece of legislation this 47th parliament will introduce. The effect of this bill is to tie every Australian to a digital identity that unlocks services necessary for life. This bill does not make identifying oneself online easier. It will facilitate making a digital identity check mandatory. That onerous measure comes at the price of putting identifying information for every Australian in the one spot and emits a giant, flashing, neon sign above everyone, saying, 'Hack me.' The

                  , Greens and the crossbench have rightly condemned the robodebt tragedy, yet the program was based on the same hubris and arrogance that informs this legislation. Time will be needed to review four key areas: the technical feasibility of a digital identity in light of previous data-matching failures; security over the data; the outcomes from identical legislation in other jurisdictions; and implications for misuse of digital identity. If those in this chamber are unaware of the significance of this legislation then they are proving the need to extend the inquiry period.

                   This reform started in 2014, when it was recommended. There have been nine years of work. I have been getting representations from the opposition—from the shadow minister—to say that we are being too slow in putting this in place, and now the opposition are going to vote to delay it. When you meet with business and small business, this is the thing that they want in place. They want a regulator in place. They want legislation around it. It is not about giving anybody a digital identity. It is about people being able—

                    Minister, I'm sorry, please resume your seat. Senator Roberts has just moved his amendment, Senator Canavan, and he was heard in silence. I remind senators who are being disorderly that, for one, you are not in your seats, so you are being even more disorderly. The minister has the right to be heard in silence.

                     This bill is about reducing the amount of information that is being held to verify your ID. That information is currently being held in a number of places. Every time you have to prove your ID, where you provide information to different organisations—this is about reducing that. This is in response to Optus. It's in response to Medibank. The private sector wants it in place. They want it regulated. We have the system in place now, and we have private sector ID providers who are unregulated. There's no regulator. The

                     is going to be put in place. This is a system that's operating now. If people choose to get a digital identity—whether it be a public identity through myGovID or through one of the private sector ones—they are operating in it now. This is about enshrining it in legislation and making sure we've got an accreditation system in place.

                     I can see all of those up there laughing. I can see what's going to happen. We know what's going to happen. You're going to misrepresent this bill, like Senator Roberts did just then. It is not mandatory. It's voluntary. It's secure. It's safe. People get to control the information that they provide to verify their identity. It's about personal control. The hypocrites on this side, who are sitting here—the opposition—are going to vote against it.

                         I withdraw. The opposition, who, in one breath, are arguing for it to be put in place faster, are now arguing for delay. You're making people less safe. You're making their identity documents less safe. That is what you are doing by supporting delaying this report until 14 May. It means that we will not have this system in place by July 2024, which is what has been sought and what has been consulted on for nine years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I inherited this from the opposition, who had failed to get it to legislation stage after eight years of working on it. This has not come out of the blue. This does not require a long committee process. There have been exposure drafts. There have been consultation processes. This is about making sure that people's information and the amount of information they have to share is reduced. It's about making sure there's a legislative framework. It's about making sure there's a regulator in place to ensure that the system works efficiently. It is about protecting individuals' own information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I cannot believe that those opposite are going to side with people who are going to pretend this bill is a whole range of things that it absolutely isn't. When they say it's mandatory, it's not. When they say it's going to steal your identity or it's a big government conspiracy, it is not. This is about personal control of your own information. It is completely voluntary. It's an important economic reform that needs to happen, and it needs to be done quickly so that we can respond to Optus and Medibank, where people's documents have been taken and have been misused and their privacy and their control over those documents has been abused. Please support the government's position, which is for a committee inquiry to report by the end of February.

We're asking for February, March and April—three months to have an inquiry on a massively significant piece of legislation.

                             Senator Canavan, please resume your seat. Once again, senators on my right are being incredibly disorderly. You're not even in your seats. The interjections are disorderly. Senator Canavan has the right to be heard in silence, and that is what I am requesting.

                              The minister is saying that somehow it will be unsafe if we wait another few months while we have an inquiry into a significant piece of legislation. This government has been in power for 18 months. If this was so important, why has it taken them 18 months to bring this legislation forward? If it's so important, why is all our data already contained and safe, apparently, and no problems?
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              We know there are already issues with the security of people's data. We know, from the Medibank fiasco that occurred just recently, that people can't always trust governments to keep their data safe. That's why there should be a significant and comprehensive inquiry that gives all Australians the opportunity to have their say.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              What the government is trying to do here is to rush this through without proper scrutiny, without Australians being able to understand what the government is doing with their data, with their security and with their privacy. This should go through because it is our job to scrutinise legislation, and there is nothing lost by waiting a few more months to get this right.
