        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Senator Payne. When the government announced its much anticipated support package for the tourism industry, 13 regions had been identified for support. At that time, Darwin, Adelaide, Hobart and Townsville were not included in the successful list. A document quoted by Hobart's

        shows that these locations were in fact originally included but then removed by the government at the last minute. Why were Adelaide, Darwin, Hobart and Townsville dumped from the government's announcement?

         I thank Senator Chisholm for his question. I believe that I indicated the locations for the half-price ticket program in my earlier response. I listed those to the chamber. I indicated that the number of questions which I have received on these matters from those opposite in recent times have specifically asked about those locations. What I was going to say, before my time expired in my earlier response, was that destinations were chosen in consultation with airlines in regard to relevant routes, using Austrade data to determine the regions that were most impacted by the loss of international tourists. There is capacity to add to the list, based on further consultation, based on consumer demand, based on the capacity of 13 destinations—

            I'm listening very carefully to the minister's answer. I've allowed you to restate that part of the question, Senator Farrell. I'm going to continue to listen, but the minister was going to the very point of the determination of which places were included. I'm going to consider that to be directly relevant. I can't instruct her on the terms in which to answer.

             As I was saying, the destinations were chosen in consultation with airlines in regard to relevant routes and using Austrade data to determine the regions most impacted by the loss of international tourists. I indicated to the chamber that there is capacity to add to the list, based on further consultation, consumer demand and the capacity of the 13 destinations and the success of the program. As I understand it, the Prime Minister has said that this is an initial list of destinations and that more routes will be added. Indeed, after further consultation with airlines and industry and advice from Austrade, Townsville, Hobart, Darwin and Adelaide have been added to the initial rollout list.

               In a confusing and embarrassing series of backflips, Darwin, Adelaide, Hobart and Townsville have now been re-added to the list, only days after the announcement.

It's a very simple proposition. The minister might want to obfuscate by creating straw people arguments, but the question is, with your announcement, why were they taken out and then re-added?

It is, however, directly relevant if the minister is talking about the determination of the locations.

                    I believe that I had said to the chamber that, after further consultation with the airlines and industry and advice from Austrade, Townsville, Hobart, Darwin and Adelaide have been added to the initial rollout list. What I don't understand is why those opposite don't support that. Why don't they support Townsville, Hobart, Darwin and Adelaide?

                         Senator Watt, I'm trying to rule on your leader's point of order. The move from relevance to direct relevance has always been interpreted to contain the nature of an answer. When ministers answer a question, further material that is provided, in my view, still needs to be directly relevant and to meet that test. I can't instruct a minister to accept the premise of a question, however. So the minister can answer in the terms that a minister deems fit. But it isn't appropriate to assign a motive to a person asking the question. Senator Payne? You have concluded your answer.

                          After being dumped from the list, Darwin was re-added within hours, while Hobart and Townsville took three days to be reannounced. Was Senator McMahon more convincing in her arguments, or did Senators Abetz and Canavan just take longer to complain to the Prime Minister?
