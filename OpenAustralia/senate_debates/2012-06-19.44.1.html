         I thank the senator for her question and her interest in the future of Australia's economy. The Gillard government recognises that today our economy is already a digital economy, and the pace of change continues to increase. The need for high-speed broadband has been demonstrated in Cisco's latest forecasts, which stated that 'internet traffic will grow in Australia sevenfold from 2011 to 2016'. That is a compound annual growth rate of 49 per cent. In Australia the average broadband speed will quadruple in the next five years from eight megabits to 36 megabits. An analysis by Ericsson released last year showed that doubling an economy's broadband speed increases
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

         by 0.3 per cent. A report released last week by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM" rel="nofollow">
          IBM
         </a>
         identified the growth that will be fuelled by high-speed broadband and the industries like mining, education and retail that will gain the most.

            unanimously told the government that it should do more to communicate about the NBN and the government's policy. We have taken that advice on board. One of those initiatives is the NBN truck, which is making its way around the country. This week, it is in Canberra. It is just down the road behind

              Unfortunately, I am aware of many. We have a confusion of alternative policies. In August 2010, Mr Turnbull said that he could do everything that he needed to do with a 3.5 megabit connection. Then in October 2010 he claimed that a 12 megabit connection to the home would be enough for everybody. Then in May this year he asserted that residential premises have no need for anything more than 25 megabits. Then last week, as I have just mentioned,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
               Mr Hockey
              </a>
              said that 4G mobile has the capacity to be far superior to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
               National Broadband Network
              </a>
              . In August of last year, the National Party emerged from under their rock to announce their policy of placing a priority on rolling out fibre optic cable to a majority of consumers in regional Australia.
