        As Senator Farrell said earlier today, there was an axis of evil conspiring in the chamber today, and that axis of evil was on full show last week and again today. Today it was the Greens and the opposition delaying once again the build of 30,000 affordable and social housing properties in this country.

         Senator Polley, please resume your seat for a moment. Those on my left: please, we've listened to everybody else with quiet dignity. Could those on that side just do that for another few minutes? Thank you very much. Senator Polley.

          There is a housing shortage in this country, and homelessness is an epidemic. Those opposite and the Greens had the opportunity today to vote on legislation to change that, but, because of the evil deal that they have done, they've shut down any further debate on the Labor government's future housing fund of $10 billion. That's what they've done. After 10 years of neglect by those opposite, when the Liberals and the Nationals were in government and did nothing at all about housing, we now have their friends over there in the corner teaming up with them to stop any future debate on that bill.

          They come in here crying their crocodile tears, and when they have the opportunity to really address social and affordable housing they run to their mates on that side of the chamber. It is winter. We have the Midwinter Ball on Wednesday night, so I hope that everyone who has their hair done and gets dressed up in their lovely frocks worth thousands of dollars thinks of those people that are sleeping rough in Launceston, in my home state of Tasmania, in the middle of winter. Shame on you. Shame on the Greens. It just shows that you guys will get into bed with anyone to be able to stop the Albanese Labor government from delivering on housing and addressing the mess that you left by neglecting those most vulnerable in this community. There are women and children fleeing domestic violence who, because of you, won't have a house.
