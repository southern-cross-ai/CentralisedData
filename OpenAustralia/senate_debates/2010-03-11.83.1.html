        My question is to the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery and Minister for Employment Participation, Senator Arbib. How many workers displaced by the cancellation of the Home Insulation Program have been provided support by the Rudd government to retain their current jobs?

         Thank you to the good senator for that question. The guidelines for the government’s worker assistance package were placed on the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations website this week. The government has put in place 25 insulation project coordinators to work with insulation companies to assist them to transition workers through to the new system. I can also confirm that 1,797 workers have commenced in the government’s employment services programs and are being assisted by

         On Friday of last week I visited the Mark Group, which is an insulation company in

           , I rise on a point of order on relevance. I asked the minister a very specific question on what support had been provided to retain workers in their current jobs. I did not ask him about how many people had gone through the employment services assistance program.

             . I have answered that part of the question. The project coordinators are talking, day in, day out, to insulation companies. My understanding is my department has spoken to over 700 companies, insulation firms, about accessing the funding pool. But just coming back to it, can I say that at the Mark Group, talking to the workers, the first thing they asked me was: ‘When will the new system come into play?’ That is a pretty important question, Senator. Will the coalition support—

               In terms of the insulation package, as was announced, the government is providing 7,000 training places and 3,000 of those are structural adjustment places which will be provided through Job Services providers to these workers. But if Senator Cormann is so concerned about the workers then, as I have said before, go down the hall, talk to Mr Abbott and get him to support the new program. If you went out, Senator, and actually spoke to some of the workers, you would know what they are after is certainty—certainty that there is going to be an industry from 1 June. This is something that the Liberal Party and Liberal senators refuse to deal with. They will not commit to the new program, which will provide a lifeline and jobs—

                    As I have said, the guidelines for the insulation package were released only this week and we have insulation project coordinators in the field talking to these companies as we speak. If Senator Cormann were fair dinkum, if he actually cared about the workers, rather than coming in here and trying to make a political point he would be talking to Mr Hunt and Mr Abbott and asking them to support the new program. That is the first point that the workers in the industry want to know: when will the new system start?

                     , I raise a point of order. The minister is misleading the Senate. He keeps talking about a new program. There is no new program.

                      There is no point of order on that. I draw the minister’s attention to the question, and to the fact that you have 27 seconds remaining to answer the question, Minister.
