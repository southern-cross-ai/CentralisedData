         I must apologise to the chamber and Senator Patrick, because my scribble meant I missed his second supplementary. I am sorry, Senator Patrick; please accept my sincere apologies. My intention is to move on with Senator Brown's question because Senator Patrick just texted me then. I will own up to that: that's the first time I've done that in my time in the chair. I owe you one, Senator Patrick. I will give you an extra one sometime.

           Northern Australia

          on this particular issue is that the Australian government is committed to protecting the lives and livelihoods of Australians from COVID-19 and takes the matter of the

          incident very seriously. The

           New South Wales
          </a>
          Special Commission of Inquiry into the Ruby Princess found the incident was primarily a failing of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
           NSW
          </a>
          Health. At Minister Littleproud's request, the Inspector-General of Biosecurity reviewed matters relating to the
          <i>
           Ruby Princess
          </i>
          and made 42 recommendations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Minister Littleproud asked the department to implement all recommendations from both the inspector-general's review and the Walker inquiry as a matter of priority, and significant progress has been made. In the article published by the ABC on 24 August 2021, the Inspector-General of Biosecurity said many other improvements were also being made. He said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I'm dramatically more positive about the ability of the department to deal with these things today, than I would have been at the same time last year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Minister Littleproud has said that the department could improve but that it is not ultimately responsible for the human health assessment. In response to the New South Wales commission and the review by the inspector-general, a series of actions have already been taken to improve the department's capability to respond to human biosecurity risks. New arrangements for communicating with human biosecurity officers and port stakeholders about human health issues are working well.

                As I said before, there was a quotation and a preamble to it. A minister is entitled to address that part of the question, not just the part at the end. Short, specific questions give much less discretion to those answering them. The minister is entitled to address the quotation that was made before the part of the question that you mentioned.
