        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Is the minister aware of animal rights groups having footage of more animal welfare breaches in Australian live export markets other than Indonesia?

         To go through some of the issues, I met with the

          RSPCA
         </a>
         on 17 November 2010 and discussed evidence gathered by Animals Australia in Kuwait and Bahrain in relation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         issues. In addition to that, I met with Animals Australia on 30 November 2010, where evidence was presented. Those areas are across the live animal export area in the Middle East. I wrote to industry in January—I think you will recall this—requesting
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_and_Livestock_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Meat and Livestock Australia
         </a>
         look at the footage to work through some of these animal welfare issues. It is an area where I have been very strong with industry, talking to industry about animal welfare issues and ensuring that they provide a path forward to assist the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequent to that, the only footage I was made aware of was the ABC

         </i>
         on the particular day that it was provided. Since then there has been no—to my knowledge or to my office's knowledge; I can check on that if you like—additional footage that has been brought forward or evidence that I can act on. As I indicated, I clearly acted on the footage from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">

         . I implemented a ban on 12 of those facilities in Indonesia and subsequently, as we now know, I suspended the trade in live animal exports. In addition to that, the government shares the community's concerns about animal welfare and is taking the necessary action to provide a secure future for the live export trade.

           As the opposition quite well know, following the decision to ban the 12 facilities in Indonesia from taking any further live exports from Australia, I com­menced work with the department to provide assurance and asked for information about what regulatory options were available to me post that decision. I also looked at the live export industry and further announced that the live export examiner would look at all markets that are utilised by the live export trade—which includes all animals, not simply cattle—and the supply chain in those markets to ensure animal welfare outcomes. I met with Mr Farmer, whom I announced—

             footage. Ministers in this government also communicated with their counterparts before the order was announced. I contacted the Indonesian agriculture minister, Mr Suswono, on 7 June. In addition, Ministers Rudd and Emerson contacted their counterparts in relation to ensuring that the animal welfare outcomes of our live animal exports are communicated to our trading partners.

             Indonesia is one of our closest partners. It is a relationship of tremendous importance to Australia and this government. The Australian government remains committed to working constructively and cooperatively with Indonesia on this issue. We are doing just that as we speak.
