        </a>
        . The 'prince of centres' passed away on 11 May this year at the age of 74—one day short of what would have been his 75th birthday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reginald William Gasnier was born in the southern Sydney suburb of Mortdale on 12 May 1939. A talented all-round sportsman, he excelled at cricket, rugby union and his chosen sport—rugby league. Reg Gasnier will be remembered as one of the greatest rugby league players of all time. His greatest weapon was acceleration—he was quick off the mark, moving from a standing start to a lighting pace in seconds. He was graceful, almost floating across the field while simultaneously avoiding tackles with a magic step or a swerve. He was a prolific try scorer but never selfish.
       </p>
       <p>
        Off the field, Reg Gasnier was a true gentleman—an absolute pleasure to meet. You could not fault him. He was self-deprecating, modest about his achievements and quick to complement others on theirs. He was passionate about the red and white, hailing from an era when young men played football for the district they grew up in. They were deeply patriotic and in those days rarely changed clubs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gasnier played for Renown United Juniors and moved quickly into the ranks of St George first grade. Reg would have played even earlier if his father thought he was ready for top-level rugby league. He played centre for the Saints from 1959 to 1967. He was part of that formidable team of the late 1950s and early 1960s, playing in six of the Dragons' record 11 consecutive premiership victories. In 125 appearances for the Dragons he scored 127 tries and kicked 20 goals.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1959 Reg Gasnier made his international debut against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        in the first test of a three-test series at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Cricket_Ground" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Cricket Ground
        </a>
        . In the second test, he tore the Kiwis apart with a hat-trick of tries. In 1962 he was named Australian captain—our youngest ever at just 23 years of age. He finished his international career with a total of 39 caps—36 in tests and three in World Cup matches—scoring 26 tries for Australia and captaining the side on eight occasions. He retired prematurely, at the age of 28, after breaking his leg against a French provincial team on the 1967 Kangaroo tour. Following retirement, Reg Gasnier embarked on a successful career in the media. Many would remember his words of wisdom on ABC Grandstand's television coverage of the Saturday match of the day during the 1970s.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1985, Reg Gasnier was selected as one of rugby league's four original immortals, along with

        player and was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame and the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame. He was a

         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>

        </a>
        and the

         Centenary Medal
        </a>
        . He is celebrated in bronze in a life-size sculpture in the forecourt of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Football_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Football Stadium

        . It is appropriate that he be remembered here in the Senate, particularly in the presence of one of our number, Senator Lazarus, who himself, of course, was a rugby league great.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those of my generation, Reg Gasnier was simply part of our lives—a prodigy, a hero and, now, a loss for so many. Vale, Reg Gasnier.
