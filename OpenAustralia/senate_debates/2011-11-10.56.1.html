         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Network" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Network
         </a>
         is a core element of Australia's overseas broadcasting network and a major public diplomacy platform. It makes a significant contribution to the promotion and protection of Australia's national interests. The Gillard government is determined to ensure the Australia Network has a strong and effective operator that will advance our national interests. The tender process was terminated on legal advice that it was compromised by the leaking of information confidential to the process. I would like to emphasise that at all times the government has acted within the terms and conditions of the tender process.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the benefit of the Senate it is worth again explaining both how the Australia Network has come to this point and the absolute priority of the government's actions at every stage of the process. The government announced that it would conduct—

          , I rise on a point of order. The point is that the minister is not being directly relevant to the question. He was asked whether the government had sought legal advice about one matter—that is, the potential exposure of the Commonwealth to a liability and damages at the suit of the tenderers. He has referred to other legal advice on a different matter. He is now proposing to rehearse the history of the tender. He has not approached or gone near the question he was asked.

           There is no point of order. Senator Conroy has been giving a direct and full answer to the question asked of him. The question went to the tender process and the legal issues associated with it, and Senator Conroy has been directly relevant to those questions and is putting in context the issues of the legal advice to the government in dealing with the tender process. He is directly on the point and has about 50 seconds to go to complete his answer, which will be a full answer to the question asked of him.

             in November last year, and, as is normal practice for these matters, placed an official public notification of the tender on AusTender on 4 February of this year. Tenderers were given until 25 March to respond. The tenders were considered by an independent panel of government officials in a process which, again—as is normal practice for such a large tender—took several months.

My supplementary question is this: what is the government's estimate of the costs suffered by the Commonwealth as a result of the abandonment of the tender process and the additional costs which the Commonwealth will incur as a result of the tender process having to be repeated? Does the minister accept that responsibility for this debacle must lie somewhere within the government and that the liability for the damages caused by the leak must also fall upon the person or persons within the government who corrupted the process?

                      Senator Conroy is dealing with a complex issue. He is dealing with an issue that involves an inquiry into the leaking of information during the tender process. Senator Conroy has made it clear that his primary response to the questions asked of him is that the government is acting on that legal advice. That is perfectly directed to the questions asked of him. He is then trying to provide some information regarding those processes. He has made it clear there is an ongoing investigation and an ongoing process inside government, and I think he is directly relevant to the question being asked of him.
