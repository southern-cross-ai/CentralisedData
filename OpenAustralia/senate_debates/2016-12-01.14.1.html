        I also table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments. The government amendments to the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill give effect to the government's acceptance of all 24 recommendations of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        , and also some further amendments, arising from further consideration, of a minor nature. All states have indicated their agreement to these amendments under the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Counter-Terrorism Laws. The amendments improve the safeguards, operations and oversight of the post-sentence preventative detention scheme for high risk terrorist offenders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments will provide that an application for a continuing detention order may be commenced up to 12 months, rather than six months, prior to the expiry of a terrorist offender's sentence. The scope of the offences to which the scheme applies will be limited by removing offences against subdivision B of division 80 of the Criminal Code—that is, the offence of treason—and offences against subsections 119.72 and 119.73 of the Criminal Code—that is, the offence of publishing recruitment advertisements. The government has accepted the view of the PJCIS that those two categories of criminal offences are not appropriate to be comprehended within the regime of the post-sentence detention scheme. The Attorney-General must apply to the Supreme Court for a review of a continuing detention order at the end of the period of 12 months after the order began in force or 12 months after the most recent review has ended, and the failure to do so will mean that the continuing detention order will cease to be in force.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments provide that the Attorney-General must undertake reasonable inquiries to ascertain any facts known to a Commonwealth law enforcement or intelligence or security officer that would reasonably be regarded as supporting a finding that a continuing detention order should not be made or is no longer required. They provide that the application for a continuing detention order or a review of a continuing detention order must include a copy of any material in the possession of the Attorney-General or any statements of facts that the Attorney-General is aware of that would reasonably be regarded as supporting a finding that an order should not be made. They provide that on receiving an application for an interim detention order the court must hold a hearing where the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for considering that a continuing detention order will be made in relation to the terrorist offender.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments also provide that each party to the proceeding may bring forward their own preferred relevant expert or experts, and the court will then determine the admissibility of each expert's evidence. They provide that any responses to questions or information given by the terrorist offender to an expert during an assessment will not be admissible in evidence against the offender in criminal or other civil proceedings. They provide that the criminal history of the offender that the court must have regard to in making its continuing detention order will be confined to convictions for those offences referred to in paragraph 105A.31A of the bill, that is terrorism offences. They provide that if the offender due to circumstances beyond his or her control is unable to obtain legal representation, the court may stay the proceeding and/or require the Commonwealth to bear all or part of the reasonable costs of the offender's legal representation in the proceeding.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments provide that when sentencing an offender convicted under any of the provisions of the Criminal Code to which the continuing detention scheme applies the sentencing court must warn the offender that an application for continuing detention could be considered. Finally, they provide that the continuing detention scheme will be subject to a sunset period of 10 years after the day the bill receives royal assent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, to enhance oversight of the continuing detention scheme, the amendments also provide that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2

             I wish to ask the Attorney some questions that I flagged in my contribution to the second reading debate—which he did respond to, to be fair to him, in his summary on the second reading. But I want to indicate that his responses have raised further issues in the minds of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Greens
             </a>
             . Firstly, I just want to reject the categorisation of the Australian Greens as a left-wing authoritarian party--although it is reassuring to me that you believe that, Attorney, because it says to me that you do no understand what drives the Australian Greens, and while you do not understand what drives us you will never defeat us. So, it is reassuring to me that you have miscategorised the Australian Greens so egregiously.
            </p>
            <p>
             With regard to the standard of proof, you have referred the Senate to the Briginshaw standard. I mentioned the Briginshaw standard, not by name but by effect, in my second reading contribution when I mentioned the term 'comfortable satisfaction'. Now, you said in your summary on the second reading that the standard of proof that this legislation creates, which is 'a high degree of probability', falls between the civil standard of 'balance of probability' and the criminal standard of 'beyond reasonable doubt'. You then referred us to the Briginshaw standard of 'comfortable satisfaction'.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, Attorney, I have a couple of questions for you. Firstly, if it is your intent that the courts interpret a standard of high degree of probability as the Briginshaw standard of comfortable satisfaction, why did you not use those words—'comfortable satisfaction'—in this legislation? Secondly, can you please confirm that it is your intent that the courts interpret 'high degree of probability' as 'comfortable satisfaction'? I do think it is important that you place it on the record, because the courts may well come back to this debate in order to assist them in interpreting the legislation. Thirdly, I want to remind you that I have asked you whether there is any other legislation in any Australian jurisdiction that establishes a standard of proof of high degree of probability or comfortable satisfaction. That is a question specifically in regard to legislation, not to jurisprudence and previous decisions of any court in this country. Finally, could you also, if you are able, point the Senate to any other legislation, anywhere in the world, that uses the Briginshaw standard or the term 'high degree of probability' in establishing a standard of proof?

              To deal with the last point first, every state, other than
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               South Australia
              </a>
              , uses the term 'high degree of probability' as the standard of proof in relation to state laws concerning the postsentence detention of serious violent offenders or serious sexual offenders. You are looking questioningly at me, Senator
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKim" rel="nofollow">
               McKim
              </a>
              , but that is what I am advised. In fact, in preparing this legislation we have been very mindful of trying to ensure that we have followed the existing state legislation quite closely, because the existing state legislation was upheld in the High Court some years ago in a case called Fardon's case. Therefore, to inoculate this legislation against the possibility of a constitutional challenge, we wanted to ensure that we based it on legislation which, as I said, the High Court has upheld.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am reminded that Tasmania does not have a postsentence detention regime. Perhaps that is why you were looking at me doubtfully a moment ago, Senator McKim. But all of the other five states do, and, of the other five states, only South Australia does not use the term 'high degree of probability'.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator McKim, you also invited me to comment on the difference between the so-called Briginshaw standard, 'comfortable satisfaction', and the standard of 'high degree of probability'. I think it is prudent to leave that to the courts; I do. In closing the second reading debate I did respond to some questions you raised as to where 'high degree of probability' sits in the hierarchy of standards of proof between the traditional civil standard, 'balance of probabilities', and the traditional criminal standard, 'beyond reasonable doubt'. I think it is uncontroversial to say that it sits above the former and beneath the latter, as does the Briginshaw standard. In a parliamentary debate, to commentate on the way in which courts might interpret the standard and apply it to a particular case is I think something best avoided. I think that the application of an acknowledged and well-established standard of proof is something best left to the courts, before whom applications under this legislation will be brought, so I will refrain from doing that.
             </p>
             <p>
              You asked me whether there is any other jurisdiction in the world which has such a standard. Senator McKim, I know that in the United Kingdom, with whose Attorney-General and Home Secretary I have had discussions, there is legislation very much akin to this. I believe that is the case in other states the European Union as well. Certainly, in the United Kingdom there is legislation akin to this.

              <p>
               Thank you, Attorney-General, for your response. I will check the other state legislation to which you have referred. The reason I was looking doubtfully at you is that the advice you have just provided to the Senate is not consistent with the advice I have, but I am happy to double-check that. I do not seek to challenge you on that today. My advice is that some of the statutes at a state level actually do require a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, not a high degree of probability. But I will check that and, if necessary, we can resume the conversation a later date.
              </p>
              <p>
               I wanted to now go to your view that an interpretation of where 'high degree of probability' sits in relation to the Briginshaw standard of 'comfortable satisfaction' is best left courts. I think the view that that is best left to the courts reflects to a degree, if I might say, your legal background here. As you know, I do not have a formal legal background and would regard myself more as parliamentarian than a lawyer, if I can put it in those terms. I will just respectfully say that I do not agree with you. I think it is the parliament's job to be clear with the courts about how they ought to interpret legislation. It remains my view the you ought offer some guidance to the courts in this debate in regards to how they ought to interpret the term 'high degree of probability' in relation to or in comparison to the Briginshaw standard of 'comfortable satisfaction'.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I wanted to ask you a further question, which goes to the policy intent of this legislation. It is very simple one: why have you decided to make the standard of proof 'high degree of probability' rather than 'beyond reasonable doubt', which is obviously the criminal standard? I might add, that is standard those who the legislation applies to will have been convicted using.

                , I acknowledge your point about the parliament, being the authors of the legislation, being perfectly entitled to entertain a discussion about the meaning of terms in the legislation; but I do think it is a little dangerous, where we are dealing with nuanced language that has to be applied by courts, to in this debate be making remarks that might be regarded as too prescriptive.
               </p>
               <p>
                In relation to the policy issue that you raise, I think it is very simple: this is an unusual power. The reason for your opposition to it, and of Senator Leyonhjelm's opposition to it, is that you do not think the state should have this power. I acknowledge the force of that argument. It is for me to make the case that the circumstances are so exceptional, the safeguards are so extensive and the resort to these powers by government is so rare that we ought to create an exception to the general rule. The general rule is where a person has served their period of detention, if they receive a custodial sentence upon conviction for a crime, then they are a free man or woman. That is the basic position of the criminal law. It is the basic proposition upon which the penal system works. What we are doing is adding a new jurisdiction which will be rarely used and only in circumstances of extremity, defined by a serious risk to public safety in relation to likely recidivist terrorist criminals.
               </p>
               <p>
                For that very reason, we do not think that the ordinary civil standard of proof—which, as I say, in layman's terms might be expressed as 'more likely than not'—is good enough. We do not. Just as we do not think that the civil standard is appropriate for the conviction of a crime upon criminal trial nor do we think the civil standard is appropriate to make such a serious order affecting the liberty of a person whose term of imprisonment has expired. But nevertheless, if this unusual jurisdiction is to be exercised, then it seemed appropriate to us—because this is not an application of the criminal law; this is a protective measure and not a punitive measure—that something more than the civil standard but something less the standard of proof in a criminal trial was the appropriate level of satisfaction that the decision-maker, a

                judge, needed to have.
               </p>
               <p>
                I might say, in relation to that, that it is also relevant to point you to another provision of the act. That is, that a judge before whom an application of this kind is brought also has to be satisfied that there is not a less invasive way of dealing with the risk posed by the criminal who sentence is about to expire, such as, for example, a control order. The decision-maker, the judge, needs to be satisfied not only of the level of the risk but of the appropriateness of preventative detention as the most invasive form of protecting community safety in such a case.

                 I just want to address a couple of points there, Attorney. Firstly, we will just have to agree to disagree on the wisdom or otherwise of you, as the country's Attorney-General, offering more prescriptive guidance to the courts. I still maintain the view that it would be appropriate for you to do so, but, nevertheless, you have determined that, in your view, it is not, and that is a matter on which we will simply have to agree to disagree.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With regard to the standard of proof, you have spoken about the high degree of probability in the context of both the civil standard of proof and the criminal standard of proof. Just for clarity, I am not arguing that, if you are going to proceed with legislation of this type, you should be applying a lower standard of proof—that is, the civil standard of proof. I am not arguing that at all. I am actually arguing you ought to be applying a higher standard of proof, which is the criminal standard of proof.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I just need to make the point again that the people to whom this legislation might apply will have been convicted under criminal law using a standard of proof of 'beyond reasonable doubt'. I am just saying this to place it on the record. I know I am not going to convince you to change your view here, Attorney, but I do think it needs to be placed on the record. You are now proposing that the courts can imprison someone because they might commit a crime, and that they can do so using a standard of proof that is significantly lower than the criminal standard of proof. I just think that needs to be placed very clearly on the record.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You have categorised this as an unusual power, and that is a matter on which we completely agree. This is a very unusual power. You have indicated, Attorney, that it is your view that this power will be used sparingly, and I am paraphrasing you here. And can I say that, if I have paraphrased you correctly, that is a matter in which I join you in fervent hope—that it will only be used sparingly. But I do want to place on the record, Attorney, that you cannot make commitments on behalf of future parliaments, future attorneys-general or future holders of statutory offices in this country. You are simply not in a position to make commitments.
                </p>
                <p>
                 History is replete with examples of the misuse of powers that have been previously created. I could take you to those at length, if you wish, but I think that, given where we are on the last day of sitting, I will restrain myself. But I simply want to say that there are plenty of examples through history of parliaments that have created powers for a specific purpose to address a specific perceived issue and then in the future, and sometimes a long way in the future, those powers have been arguably misused. So the Greens still maintain our view here that there is a possibility that these powers would be used more often than sparingly in the future. We acknowledge that there is a sunset clause now attached to this legislation, but our concerns remain, and we remain opposed to this legislation.

                  The criminal standard 'beyond reasonable doubt' is just not apt to make what is essentially an evaluative judgement in the application of this legislation. The test that the

                   Supreme Court
                  </a>
                  judge has to turn his or her mind to under proposed section 105A.7(1)(b) says:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  … after having regard to matters in accordance with section 105A.8—
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  to which I will come—
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability, on the basis of admissible evidence, that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious Part 5.3 offence if the offender is released into the community …
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It also says:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  (c) the Court is satisfied that there is no other less restrictive measure that would be effective in preventing the unacceptable risk.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The term 'unacceptable risk' is not a defined term, so that is why I say there is a level of evaluation in this judgement that the court must make. The criminal standard 'beyond reasonable doubt', which means you cannot have a reasonable doubt if you are going to reach a deferment of conclusion on the basis of the criminal standard, is just not apt in the application of that test because I daresay it could be always asserted that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether or not an offender—a prisoner, I should say—convicted of a serious terrorism offence would pose an unacceptable level of risk.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The criminal standard of proof is, in fact, a very rigid standard, and it is, as I say, just not apt to apply to a decision which involves a degree of evaluation of this kind. The matters to which the court has to have regard in proposed section 105A.8 include:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  … the safety and protection of the community—

                 <p class="italic">
                  … any report, relating to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community … prepared by—
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  competent bodies; the offender's participation in—
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  … any treatment or rehabilitation programs—
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  while in prison—
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  … the level of the offender's compliance with … obligations to which he or she has been subject while—
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  imprisoned, on release, on parole or—
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  … subject to a continuing detention order or interim detention order;
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  … the offender's criminal history …

                  of the conviction; and any other information that the court may have regard to. All of those matters set out quite a comprehensive list of relevant considerations to which the court needs to have regard. Those matters are only considered on the basis of admissible evidence, by the way—so hearsay is not allowed and other forms of information that are often allowed before decision-making bodies of this kind are not allowed here. It has to be admissible evidence, and the court has to make that evaluative judgement as to the unacceptable level of risk the offender poses to the community. That is why we have not used the very inflexible and, in this case, I suspect, practically impossible to satisfy, criminal standard of proof.
