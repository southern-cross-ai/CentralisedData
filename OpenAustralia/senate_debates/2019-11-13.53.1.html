        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie" rel="nofollow">
         McKenzie
        </a>
        . In a deal with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        , the minister has finally released the draft dairy code of conduct for consultation. The minister's Nationals colleagues have been left fuming, with one complaining of the minister: 'She can deliver for Hanson but she can't deliver for us.' Another colleague has said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We've been busting our arses on dairy, holding the line because we were told it couldn't be done, and then Hanson rolls out and claims the whole bloody lot.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why did it take One Nation to get the minister to bring forward the release of the dairy code of conduct?

         Order! Before I call the minister, I did hear some interjections about language. The precedent that has been adopted, generally, is that if something has been used in
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         repeatedly it is not going to be ruled out of order. I would encourage all senators, however, that just because it has been used it doesn't necessarily mean it's appropriate or meets the dignity of the chamber to keep using it. Senator Bernardi on a point of order?

           Obviously, Senator Bernardi, I do not have the facility to check that as we speak. I have, however, been asked about words of that calibre previously, and they have been in the
           <i>
            Hansard
           </i>
           for decades. My view is that where something has not been ruled out of order previously, unless it is egregious, it's not for the chair to change a standing precedent. However, as I urge all senators, just because something has been done it doesn't necessarily mean it is great for the dignity of the chamber to do it again. Senator Bernardi?

              Secondly, it may have been your ruling previously that just quoting bad language, because someone else has said it—I think it was in respect of Senator Cash—was not an appropriate excuse or rationale for using it.

               I was very aware of my predecessor's ruling on that matter, which was in 2017, which is why I referred to, shall we say, more egregious language. I would describe that language as interpreted by most people as being substantially more offensive than what people are objecting to in that question. I ask senators to use their discretion. Senator

                I did. In my defence I would have to say that I'm hardly known for using this sort of terminology in general parlance. However, the question remains a very accurate representation of the outrage within the National Party, and I think it should stand.

                  , for your question. The National Party is standing with our nation's dairy farmers ad nauseam, as we've debated through question time this week. We're very proud to be the only party that took to the election what the dairy farmers in this country wanted. They came together and voted as one for a mandatory dairy code on the back of the

Joel had a whole suite of initiatives that he was going to do. They didn't want that. They wanted the mandatory dairy code of conduct and a whole raft of measures that we committed to: legal and financial advice within the

                      On winning the election we, as a government, as a party, took every step to actually bring forward the release of the dairy code. I actually wrote to my department in August seeking, on the back of the lobbying from my own party members, to bring forward the code. So the department and the Office of

Why did it take a threat to her leadership for the minister to consider this measure for farmers?

                         place on the department's website around the dairy code, because we're consulting not only on the code but on this innovative approach to trading platforms for milk products, as Mr Gillespie absolutely raised.

Another said she 'couldn't organise a piss-up in a brewery'. Is the minister confident she retains the support of the Nationals party room?

                                I am not going into my private conversations with colleagues other than to say, given you've raised it, Senator Rennick, that I think I recommended against its use. The context of first speeches is also that they avoid contentious elements given the courtesy extended by all senators in the chamber, and I did go through that with an explanation. I am going to check that word. I'm certain it's been used before. If not, I'll come back and ask the senator to withdraw. I ask senators to show some discretion in the use of their language and maybe allude to the terms that some in the public might find offensive or inappropriate for the decorum of the parliamentary chamber.

                                    , please resume your seat. There is a ruling by Senator Parry on the use of very contentious language with respect to quoting, I believe, a court case transcript of a highly contentious issue at the time. Senator Parry ruled that, when it came to that particular language, quotation of something does not make something parliamentary. I will check whether that word is parliamentary—

                                      . I will check the use of this term. But this problem won't arise if senators don't use it and maybe use other words to allude to it rather than use words that set the chamber off. Some self-restraint is not a bad idea in the chamber.

                                          Senator Parry's ruling, to paraphrase it, was that quotation of unparliamentary language does not make it parliamentary. That was about a particularly offensive term, if I recall correctly. Context does matter. I don't think this word has been ruled unparliamentary before. I will check that. If it has, I'll come back to the chamber. As I've said, my view is that, if a word has been used and other presidents have allowed it, so will I. If the chamber wants to express its view that it's unparliamentary, I'll enforce it. But I'm not going to make a unilateral ruling on a word that has been used.

                                          repeat my plea: this problem doesn't arise if senators don't use the language. An allusion can be made to language without necessarily quoting it and then we won't have this distraction. I'll come to Senator

                                           We're interested in actually delivering a dairy code for the dairy industry to strengthen their power against the egregious behaviour of processors. That's what our party's interested in doing. In terms of any events that I may or may not have the capacity to hold, I do give this commitment to the chamber: it will be an open bar and an open invitation for all.
