        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Senator Canavan. Can the minister outline how the Liberal-National government's sound budget and economic management is strengthening vital infrastructure investments to support Australian families and businesses, including in my home state of

         I thank Senator Antic for his question and his keen interest in seeing better infrastructure built in his home state. There is one role that government can play in our economy, and that is building infrastructure around our country. That's why we are managing the nation's budget carefully. That's why we are making sure we are careful spending other people's money, so that we can spend record amounts of investment in infrastructure to build a better country. That is why we are investing over $100 billion in 130 projects, creating over 80,000 jobs across Australia, and lots of that is happening in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         too.
        </p>
        <p>
         In South Australia, in this year's budget, an additional $2.6 billion was allocated to infrastructure projectsâ€”part of the broader infrastructure package for South Australia. That package includes $4.5 billion to upgrade the north-south corridor. It includes $361 million for the Urban Congestion Fund just in South Australia. It includes $260 million for the Rural Roads Safety package. It includes $220 million for the Gawler rail line infrastructure upgrade as well. That is just in our existing portfolio package.
        </p>
        <p>
         But we are also making sure that we can bring forward this investment as soon as possible to help create jobs in our economy and get our states moving, including South Australia. That's why last month we announced that we'd bring forward $78 million of infrastructure spending in the Adelaide and metro region of South Australia and that we would also bring forward $250 million of projects in regional South Australia as well. They include, as I mentioned, the Rural Roads Safety program that we are funding and bringing forward funding on the

          Victor Harbor Road
         </a>
         and Horrocks corridor as well. All of these investments will create jobs and opportunity and build a better South Australia.

            and Burgoyne Street, a big investment there, and starting the $143 million of investments in the Rural Roads Safety package, making sure we can put in place more overtaking lanes, which are very important on rural roads to make sure that we have safe outcomes. It also includes a $90 million project at

                South Australian
               </a>
               economy is also in the unique position of being able to benefit from the broader infrastructure spending around the country because, as many of us would knowâ€”and as I know Senator Antic knows wellâ€”the South Australian economy is where we produce a lot of our steel. A lot of our steel is produced in Whyalla in South Australia. The federal government has supported the continuing production of steel in Whyalla and now it can reap the benefits of making sure that Australian steel can build Australian infrastructure projects. So, on the inland rail projectâ€”not in South Australia, but between Melbourne and Brisbaneâ€”we're using Whyalla steel, supporting South Australians' jobs and making sure we spread the benefits of our infrastructure boom right around the country. Already, 38,000 tonnes of Whyalla steel are being used to upgrade the Inland Rail in western
