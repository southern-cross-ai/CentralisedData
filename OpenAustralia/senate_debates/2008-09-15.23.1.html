What implications does that have for his promise to commence construction and offer services over the new network by the end of this year?

         I thank Senator Nash. She is one of the few senators on the other side of the chamber who have a genuine interest in this particular issue. The national broadband network is the biggest national investment in broadband infrastructure ever made by an Australian government. It represents a long-overdue investment in our nation’s future prosperity. After 11 years of inaction by those opposite, the state of broadband infrastructure has fallen behind that in countries we consider our international peers. The Rudd government has committed up to $4.7 billion and will consider regulatory changes to facilitate the rollout of the new network that will boost Australia’s productivity. Furthermore, it demonstrates that, unlike those opposite, we understand technology and the future broadband needs of Australians.

         The government is moving quickly and methodically to fulfil its election commitment. In March the government established a panel of experts who bring a strong blend of technical, regulatory, business, investment and policy skills, reflecting the complexities of the telecommunications sector.

            In June we received over 80 submissions on the regulatory structure for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
             NBN
            </a>
            , which my department’s specialist advisers as well as the expert panel are considering. In May I announced that proponents would have 12 weeks to consider the necessary network information before lodging proposals. On 7 August the government released final instruments setting out the network information that carriers are to provide for the NBN and the rules to safeguard the information. On 3 September I announced that the last of the network information requested from carriers was available to national broadband network proponents. Accordingly, proponents then had 12 weeks to consider the network information before lodging their proposals on 26 November 2008.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a major step forward in the government’s comprehensive plan to provide Australians with higher speed broadband services. Once proposals are received the expert panel will have two months to consider submissions before making a recommendation to government. Once the recommendation has been considered, the government will be in a position to make a formal announcement.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is somewhat ironic that those opposite criticise the government’s NBN process, as they have no idea what side of the fence they are sitting on regarding this matter. The shadow minister originally called the process’s time lines ‘dangerously truncated and unrealistic’. That was the shadow minister. Yet only weeks later the flip-flopping shadow minister changed his position again to criticise the government for ‘time table overruns’, asking ‘Why has it taken so long?’ Even more embarrassing is that the backflip came after Mr Billson in a press statement on 22 May stated:

             , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware that the private sector has frozen further investment in broadband infrastructure as a direct result of uncertainties surrounding his national broadband network process, and does the minister recognise that further delays will stagnate the rollout of affordable high-speed internet access to working families?

              I thank Senator Nash for the supplementary question. I was in the middle of going through Mr Billson’s quote. On 22 May he said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I have made it perfectly clear that I would not criticise the Minister for extending his deadlines ...
             </p>
             <p>
              If those opposite could communicate with each other—have a chat between chambers—you might not get such embarrassing questions being bowled up in question time. The timetable provided in the request for proposals is clearly stated. It is indicative. It was always based on the presumption that proponents would have access to relevant network information to prepare and cost their proposals. Exactly what is the opposition’s line with respect to timing? What is your line?
