              's policy capitulation sells out working people by putting nurses and teachers on the same income tax rates as managers and consultants on up to $200,000 a year. It sells out anyone who is struggling with the cost of housing by continuing to allow property investors to rack up their third, fourth, fifth, 10th or 20th investment property with the help of a massive public subsidy. This is urgent because these decisions mean cuts, into the future, on essential services like health and education.

                   is either acting in defiance of your rulings or is not understanding your rulings. The motion before the chamber is one to suspend standing orders. The debate, that you have been seeking to inform Senator McKim that he should be undertaking, is one about why it is that the motion itself needs to be considered now and warrants the suspension of standing orders. Just framing his statements with the words 'This is urgent because' and then going on to debate the policy substance of the motion he seeks to have debated is not mounting a case in relation to the suspension of standing orders. Thank you,

                   , for your ruling, but I would certainly urge all senators to understand the nuance of what the question before the chair is and relevance to that particular question.

                     On the point of order, if you were to accept the proposition put to you by Senator Birmingham, you would effectively be saying that in order to stay within the bounds of the standing orders no reference at all can be made to the substantive issue. That is, patently, a ridiculous proposition that Senator Birmingham is putting and would constitute an unnecessary restraint on this debate, and I urge you to reject his point of order.

                      , I have ruled. It is a rule; it's not a debating point. Of course you can reference your motion, but what I've heard you speak to since you got to your feet is only the motion, and you have not referenced why it is that this motion is so urgent that we have to stand aside the business of the Senate for today and deal with this motion. That's the issue at heart. It's not for you to immediately go to the motion but to explain to the Senate what's urgent about it. I would ask you to respect my ruling and to explain to the Senate, without a great reference to the actual motion, of why it's urgent that this matter be dealt with now.

                           It is urgent. We need to suspend standing orders because the planet is cooking. Neoliberalism is taking over in this country because every time the Labor Party caves in the Liberals take the win and move the contest further to the Right. Climate change is critical. It is an urgent issue and it should be debated as a matter of urgency by the Senate. This kind of approach by the Labor Party is how we've ended up in the neoliberal mess that we're in on tax, on housing and on public subsidies for fossil fuels. They're very uncomfortable about this in the

                             President, with the absolute greatest of respect to you and your position; Senator Wong and hers; and anyone else in this chamber, is simply that the debate that we are seeking to bring on relates to critical and urgent issues in the Australian public conversation and the point that whenever Labor adopts a small-target strategy the Liberals take the win and move the goalposts further to the Right. That is the urgency of this matter. That is why it should be debated by the Senate today. The Australian people want the
