        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. Is it correct that you instructed Austrade to overturn a merits based selection process for Australia's Consul-General and Senior Trade and Investment Commissioner in

        that had already been completed and had recommended the appointment of a highly skilled trade expert, Ms Kirstyn Thomson, to fill that role?

         I thank Senator Hume for her question. I am a little bit surprised that this question is being asked at this time, given the announcement in respect of former senator Ketter was made some months ago. We very publicly announced that the vacancy that was open in

         You might not like this, Senator Canavan, but we have followed all the usual processes that apply in the selection of people who represent us in these missions overseas. I'm very comfortable, I have to say, with the appointment of Mr Ketter. His—

           A point of order on direct relevance: Senator Hume's question did not raise Mr Ketter at all. Her question went specifically to the merits based process that had led to the selection, apparently, of Ms Kirstyn Thomson, a fact that had not been made public, notwithstanding the minister's insinuations, and whether or not it is correct that he had overturned that process. I ask you to draw him to the detailed part of the question, which is clearly about the merits based selection process that was undertaken.

              I do believe the minister was being relevant to the question, because it did go to the nature of overturning what was alleged to have been a decision. But I will listen carefully to the minister's continued answer, and if he strays from the question I will draw his attention to that, Senator Birmingham.

               The government, when they're making these sorts of appointments, considers—and I in particular consider—a number of factors where there is a clear advantage to be represented by people who've had distinguished careers beyond the Public Service, such as businesspeople and former parliamentarians. I'd note that that was frequently done by the former government. That's the process that—

He's talking about the selection process and the reason for the decision. I am listening carefully, and if there is a deviation from the question I will remind him and draw him back to it.

                          As a result of overturning the merits based process following the selection and notification of a preferred candidate, has Austrade had to provide an alternative opportunity to Ms Thomson to avoid paying compensation for ministerial cancellation of that merits based process? Is it true that Ms Thomson even had to train her replacement, Senator Farrell's former union and Senate colleague Chris Ketter?

                                 President, it is not directly relevant for a minister just to say, 'I've answered the question,' when the question has so blatantly not been answered. It was a very clear question about whether or not Ms Thomson had had to be offered an alternative role to avoid compensation payments. Senator Farrell has not come remotely close to answering that question.

                                   I would make the point that my recollection is that in a previous answer, in fact, there was a reference to which appointment had been made. I make the point that, if Senator Birmingham is correct and reference to a previous answer is not appropriate, there'd be a lot of former ministers on that side who did not comply with that order for many years. So I submit to you that—
