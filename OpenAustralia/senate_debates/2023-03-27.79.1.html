        My question without notice is to Minister Farrell representing the Minister for Housing. Minister, reports last week revealed Australia is one of the worst places in the developed world to be a renter. Rents are a staggering 22 per cent higher than they were in 2020, and renters in Australia are projected to pay $10 billion in rent increases this year alone. More people than ever are living in cars, caravans and tents. More and more people are struggling to pay rent and having to make the choice between rent and food, between rent and medication, between rent and childcare fees. Will the government finally do the same thing they did for energy caps and coordinate a national freeze on rent increases and coordinate national tenancy standards?

         I thank Senator Faruqi for her question. I note her sincere concern about the plight of renters in this country, which the Albanese government shares with you. Of course, this government has been coming to the parliament with solutions to the difficult issue of housing in this country. We know that a lot of people across Australia are struggling right now to find an affordable place to rent. We hear their concerns and we hear your concerns, Senator Faruqi. We are acting to address them. The answer to rental stress is a sustained boost in the supply of homes to rent and a substantial investment in new social and affordable houses. That's what this government is aiming to do, Senator Faruqi. The government struck a national housing accord between all levels of government, investors and industry to build the affordable homes our country desperately needs to boost the supply of new houses. In addition to the accord, we've now passed legislation for the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund through the House of Representatives, although I note not yet the Senate. Our ambitious reform agenda, to deliver more social and affordable homes right across the country, includes the widening of the National Housing Infrastructure Facility with up to $575 million available to invest in more social and affordable—

           homes while proposing a fund that gambles $10 billion on the stock market, which doesn't guarantee a cent to be spent on housing and, last year, would have lost $120 million. Do you accept that currently the government's housing plan will make the crisis worse for renters?

            I thank Senator Faruqi for her first supplementary question. No, I don't accept that proposition, Senator Faruqi. For instance, the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee was brought forward by three months by this government, and more than 2,000 places have already been taken up, with hundreds of Australian families now in their new homes with Help to Buy, a new program to help Australians get their own home sooner. We're establishing a permanent National Housing Supply and Affordability Council. The interim council has been operating since 1 January this year, and it provides independent expert advice to government but particularly developing a new National Housing and Homelessness Plan. The government has been talking with state and territory housing—

              Minister, the government's own National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation has reported that Australia needs at least $15 billion a year in investment in public community and affordable housing. How does the government justify proposing to spend $368 billion on nuclear Attack class submarines and only a maximum of $500 million on housing?

               (—) (): I thank Senator Faruqi for her second supplementary question. With due respect, Senator Faruqi, I think you are conflating two separate issues. One of the obligations, like it or not, that federal government have is to ensure the defence and security of Australia, and the Albanese government takes that issue seriously. That's why we've made some announcements in the last couple of weeks in terms of defence. We are bringing to this parliament a very significant reform package in terms of housing which will, we believe, assist both people getting into their own homes but, more particularly, renters, ensuring that they have an opportunity to rent and there is downward pressure on those rents.
