        , 14 March, Goulburn held a huge community celebration of its sesquicentenary. I was delighted that the Senate unanimously supported a motion of recognition of this event and that the Prime Minister sent a message of goodwill to the city because Goulburn holds the unique distinction of being proclaimed a city on two occasions. The first, unofficial, proclamation was claimed by virtue of royal letters patent issued by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Queen Victoria
        </a>
        on 14 March 1863 to establish the Diocese of Goulburn. It was a claim made for ecclesiastical purposes, as required by the traditions of the Church of England. The letters patent also established
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Saviour's_Church" rel="nofollow">
         St Saviour's Church
        </a>
        as the cathedral church of the diocese. This was the last time that letters patent were used in this way in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">
         British Empire
        </a>
        , because they had been significantly discredited for use in the colonies and were soon to be declared formally invalid and unenforceable in this context. Several legal cases had already established that the monarch had no ecclesiastical jurisdiction in colonies possessing responsible government, and this in fact had been granted to

         New South Wales
        </a>
        in 1856—seven years earlier. So the letters patent held authority only over those who submitted to it voluntarily, and then only within the context of the church. It had no legal or civil authority or implications. So Goulburn was again officially proclaimed a city on 20 March 1885, removing any lingering doubts as to its status.

        , and it was completed in 1889.

        In 1962, Goulburn was the focus of the fight for state aid to non-government schools. An education strike was called in response to a demand for installation of three extra toilets at a local Catholic primary school, St Brigid's. The local Catholic archdiocese closed down all local Catholic primary schools and sent the children to government schools, declaring that they had no money to install the extra toilets, so nearly 1,000 children turned up to be enrolled locally and the state schools were unable to accommodate them. The strike lasted only a week, but generated national debate and resulted in state aid for non-government schools.

        This is only a tiny snippet of Goulburn's colourful history, but it reminds us that the city is renowned for much more than Rambo, the big merino. Goulburn's history sets the city apart as the first inland city in Australia. With a thriving wool trade, bustling railway yards, breweries, factories and workshops, wide streets and glorious architecture, Goulburn was a beacon of prosperity for many travellers heading south and west from Sydney. It has sheltered many figures of national prominence—writers, explorers, political figures, sportsmen and women, soldiers, bushrangers and larrikins. We have embraced them all as part of the colourful tapestry that is the story of Goulburn.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 150-year celebrations provide many snippets of the past—re-enactments, maps and plans, photographs, old machinery, archives. All these elements considered separately might be seen as merely nostalgic, but the community's celebrations are the product of the residents coming together, pooling their knowledge and expertise and synthesising those pieces into a cohesive story that is accessible to all, and represents the city's character. We do not offer a manufactured or sanitised version of the past in Goulburn, as authenticity, which we have in abundance, is what people want to experience. And all of this is now available on a great new app, developed for Goulburn by AppyTravels with the support of a grant from Minister Burke's department. We have a beautiful children's book with a sound track, the
        <i>
         Talking Piano
        </i>
        , which captures many historic landmarks of the city. We have patchwork quilts and a 30-metre scarf adorning Rambo.

        On the weekend I had too much choice. In two days I attended: the street parade; an art exhibition opening at the South Hill Gallery; a community concert; a wonderful play by the local theatre group the Leider Theatre, about the life of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Franklin" rel="nofollow">
         Miles Franklin
        </a>
        ; fireworks; bellringing; night-light displays; and, on Sunday, a tour of the crypt of Sts Peter and Pauls Catholic cathedral. I want to congratulate everyone who has been involved in the celebrations that continue throughout the year: the Goulburn Mulwaree councillors, the community committee, the Regional Conservatorium, the many, many volunteers and of course the

        and local radio stations, 2GN and Eagle

        , for a wonderful celebration.
