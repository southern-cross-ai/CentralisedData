        My question is to the Minister for Tourism and International Education. I note that the popular Flavours of Tasmania event will be held in the great hall this evening. Will the minister update the Senate about Tasmania's high-quality food and beverage offering, which is a key feature of the state's tourism industry?

         Yes, tonight is in fact one of the more famous events that occurs in

         , Flavours of Tasmania, which is organised by our good Tasmanian friend and colleague Senator Abetz. He needs to take great credit for the initiative of pulling the team together and delivering such a brilliant program that will be held in the great hall tonight. I am certain that people will enjoy that.

         Tasmania's fine food and beverage is indeed a key element in our state's tourism offering. It is one of the things that makes our great state famous and it is one of the things that brings people back to Tasmania again and again. Tonight in the great hall we will see a number of those people display their fine goods and wares. We will have people like Providence Vineyards, Pipers Brook,

         At the recent National Tourism Awards, to build on the strength of the Tasmanian tourism industry, we saw Tasmania win 10 of the 29 tourism awards that were awarded at that event recently. And

             (—) (): The sudden enthusiasm from the opposition for the tourism industry is very welcome I have to say. The government does recognise the importance of the tourism industry, particularly to regional areas such as Tasmania. It is a very important industry in regional Australia. Last year 45 per cent —which amounts to $42.7 billion—of tourism expenditure was spent in regional Australia. To support this industry, earlier this year the Australian and the Tasmanian governments announced almost $800,000 in funding to boost tourism infrastructure in Tasmania. The project—

               It is a very important question. Earlier this month I announced with the Tasmanian Premier, who is the Tasmanian Minister for Tourism, the development of a Tasmanian tourism employment plan which focuses on the north-west coast of Tasmania. This will deliver projects to help local industry attract high-quality staff, reskill its workforce and create capacity to handle the strong growth in tourism numbers that we are experiencing in Tasmania. We are reacting to that strong growth in tourism numbers in Tasmania as a responsible government should. The Industry Skills Fund will fund more than 250,000 training places to Australia's workforce and support services staff and employers. Tourism businesses are eligible to apply for skills advice and training grants.
