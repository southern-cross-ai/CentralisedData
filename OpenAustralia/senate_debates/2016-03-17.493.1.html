        I note the opposition supports these bills and I seek leave to incorporate the opposition's second reading speech in Hansard to facilitate proceedings in the chamber this evening.

        I rise to express Labor's support for these two bills.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As Senators would be aware, there have been numerous enquiries since 1979 with regard to matters pertaining to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk" rel="nofollow">
         Norfolk
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island" rel="nofollow">
         Island
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Central to these enquiries have been the sustainability and appropriateness of the governance arrangements, the capacity of a community of around 1800 people to be financially sustainable, and the delivery of services and infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It has become clear that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Norfolk Island
        </a>
        community is not able to provide Federal functions. This includes functions such as immigration, quarantine and customs, social services and taxation as well as state and local government services in a sustainable way.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Successive Federal governments have sought to reform governance arrangements of Norfolk Island to ensure a decent standard of services and infrastructure for the people of Norfolk Island.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When in office, Labor started the reform agenda for Norfolk Island with the passage of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories" rel="nofollow">
         Territories
        </a>
        Law Reform
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Bill
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We also initiated the road map for reform in 2011 in partnership with the people of Norfolk Island, together with providing emergency funding assistance and investments in infrastructure to lift economic opportunities on the Island.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the significant economic and financial challenges facing Norfolk Island, governance, administrative and legal reform is required to bring the jurisdiction in line with mainland standards for health and community services and taxation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian citizens on Norfolk Island deserve equal access to services as other Australians, whether on the mainland or the other external territories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor is committed to working in partnership with the people of Norfolk Island to ensure this occurs and to harness the opportunities before them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And that is why Labor supports these bills.

        <p>
         The bills being considered today also have bipartisan support, and I look forward to continuing this approach as we put
