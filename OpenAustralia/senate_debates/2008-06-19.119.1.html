        My question is also to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to her answer to the excellent question from Senator Milne yesterday. Can the minister advise how many ‘millionaires’ have been paid the solar panel rebate?

            I am pleased to take the question because it enables me to provide a further response to Senator Milne, which I was going to provide at the conclusion of question time, in relation to the statistical information about the uptake of the solar power rebate. I can advise the chamber that the department publishes a range of information about the installation of solar photovoltaic power systems. These include the number of systems installed by month for residential and community buildings, the number of watts installed by month as a result of system installations and the cumulative number of installations by state. I am advised that these statistics are generally updated on a quarterly basis. The last update was done in April, for February data.
           </p>
           <p>
            The department advises me that Senator Milne asked her question yesterday at 2.47 pm and, for the record, the installation statistics for March and April were available on the department’s website at 2.15 pm—obviously prior to the senator’s question. So I can give an indication that these statistics are available and the information that is included on the department’s website is set out in what I have provided. The statistics for March 2007 were updated in May 2008. I am not sure if that is actually correct; that might be a typo in this brief. The statistics for June 2007 were provided in August 2007. The September 2007 statistics were provided in November 2007. The December 2007 statistics were provided in February 2008. So there is obviously a system in place whereby the information in relation to the solar photovoltaic power systems is placed on the website. I am pleased that I have been able to assist the chamber with the provision of that information.

                      As I indicated in the primary answer, the information that I have been advised that the department retains about this program is the number of systems installed by month for residential and community buildings, the number of watts installed by month as a result of system installations and the cumulative number of installations by state.

                         , I rise on a point of order on relevance. Senator Wong, in her answer yesterday, indicated that millionaires were being paid the solar rebate. My question was: how many millionaires have received the solar rebate and could that question be answered?
