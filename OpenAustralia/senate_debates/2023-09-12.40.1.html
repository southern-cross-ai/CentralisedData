        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Albanese Labor government is delivering on its promise to build more homes for Australians through the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund? Can you please confirm the fund will create a secure ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable rental housing?

         I thank
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_White" rel="nofollow">
          Senator White
         </a>
         for her question and I thank her, not only for her continued support for more housing in Australia for Australians who need it but for her advocacy for social justice and equity for all of her working life including in this Senate. We do have an ambitious housing reform agenda and we welcome the new support for the Housing Australia Future Fund. We look forward to the Senate dealing with the legislation expeditiously.
        </p>
        <p>
         This fund, the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, will ensure there is consistent and ongoing funding for social and affordable rental housing. Returns from the fund will help deliver our commitment to 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes in the fund's first five years. And it will deliver the Albanese government's commitments to help address acute housing needs, including $200 million for the repair, maintenance and improvements of housing in remote Indigenous communities. It will provide $100 million for crisis and transitional housing options for women and children impacted by family violence and for older women, who, we know, are increasingly at risk of homelessness, and there will be funding to build housing for veterans who are experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of homelessness. We've announced additional funds of $1 billion to be invested in the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to support new homes.
        </p>
        <p>
         So despite persistent ongoing and unconscionable opposition from those who presided over the housing crisis, we are now tackling the Liberals and Nationals, who sowed the seeds of housing crisis in their wasted decade in government, who neglected those most in need. Those on this side of the chamber are working to deliver more homes for Australians, something that you consistently oppose.

            We know that renters are doing it tough. I want to emphasise that the 30,000 homes in the first five years of the Housing Australia Future Fund are rental homes—social and affordable rentable homes. We are providing additional funding on top of the Housing Australia Future Fund for social and affordable rental homes. We have worked with the states and territories on the National Housing Accord to build 1.2 million homes over the next five years. These are important measures that will put downward pressure on rental prices by increasing supply. We are also working with states and territories to secure a better deal for renters to improve renters rights across the country. This government is delivering the largest increase in Commonwealth rent assistance in more than 30 years, as well as working to get more Australians into home ownership with the expanded home guarantee—

              Australia's peak housing and homelessness bodies have been steadfast in their support of the Albanese government's housing reforms. Can the minister explain why the sector wants all parliamentarians to pass the Housing Australia Future Fund bill?

                    The supplementary question went to the attitudes of peak housing and homelessness bodies. I do understand why Senator Ruston is embarrassed about discussing this. I do understand why she finds it hard to defend their opposition to more homes.

                            Thank you. I do understand why those opposite are embarrassed about their position on housing, which is what the intervention by the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate demonstrated. They are so embarrassed about their position that they don't even want a government dixer on it. That is a new level of sensitivity from the opposition, and that is because their position is an unarguable position. It is an illogical position. Just ask Homelessness Australia's Kate Colvin, who said:

The Urban Development Institute have spoken out in support of this. You are on your own in your relentless negativity and in your opposition to new houses.
