         I thank Senator Crossin for that question. The Rudd government is committed to ensuring that regional, rural and remote areas of Australia are prosperous and sustainable. In the last budget the government announced it would commit up to $400 million to respond to the regional telecommunications review chaired by Dr Bill Glasson. The Glasson review, tabled in parliament last year, catalogued the failures of the previous government to deal with deficient regional telecommunications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last Friday, the government tabled its response and made a down payment of $60 million, in line with the regional review’s recommendations. Of that, $46 million will be directed to a Digital Regions Initiative that will boost innovation in health care, increase the use of digital technology to improve emergency responses and extend digital education services. The government also committed $11.4 million in new funds to increase and extend the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme. The subsidy has been increased to 85 per cent of the handset cost, from the 60 per cent set by the former government, and includes the replacement of handsets purchased over three years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, the government has committed an additional $3.7 million to a $30 million refocused Indigenous Communications Program. The Rudd government understands that regional communications has a critically important role in supporting regional Australia’s economic development and continued prosperity.

           I am glad that those opposite keep raising OPEL, because I am sure that there is much more that can be put on the record about OPEL.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer and for raising the issue of OPEL. I further ask: is the minister aware of claims that the former government’s failed broadband plan, OPEL ‘would have delivered high-speed broadband to 90 per cent of Australia by the end of 2009’? What is the minister’s response to this?

             I have seen those claims by Senator Minchin. They are incorrect and grossly irresponsible. The conditions precedent of the funding agreement signed by the former government, signed by Senator Helen Coonan, required OPEL to provide coverage reasonably equivalent to 90 per cent of 527,747 underserved premises. In other words, OPEL was required to cover approximately five per cent of Australian premises identified as underserved. OPEL’s coverage would have been far less than the 99 per cent figure claimed by Senator Minchin. In any event, the assessment showed that OPEL failed to demonstrate that it was able to meet its required coverage. By calling for OPEL—

               </a>
               will deliver high-speed broadband services to 98 per cent of Australia’s homes and businesses—a significant number of them in regional Australia. The Rudd government understands that access to broadband services is essential for the long-term prosperity of our regions. It will enable new services and drive productivity. I note the comments made by Senator Barnaby Joyce today relating to Telstra’s

               is so important and the government remains committed to building it. Telstra’s announcement is purely about serving metropolitan Australia. That is exactly why the former government failed so miserably in communications and broadband policy—because they were not interested in all of Australia.
