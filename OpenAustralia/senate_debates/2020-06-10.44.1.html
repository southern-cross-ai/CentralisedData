        <p>
         Thank you very much, Senator O'Sullivan, for the question and also for your dedication to defence industry in our home state and right across this nation. This government's record in defence industry capability is playing an important part in our economy in four ways. Firstly, it's delivering the economic lifeline Australians need to get through the virus. Secondly, it's reopening our economy and our society for a clear road ahead. Thirdly, it's building confidence and momentum in our economy. Fourthly, it is contributing to positioning our economy for long-term growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Defence is the Australian Commonwealth's largest employer. Defence also directly employs and engages over 120,000 Australians—120,000 Australians! From this position of workforce strength and stability, Defence is leading in its contribution of job creation and opportunities in this nation. Many tens of thousands more Australians across defence industry are now benefiting from this government's $200 billion investment in new ADF capability.
        </p>
        <p>
         In naval shipbuilding alone direct jobs will grow by over 2½ thousand over the next five years, growing to 15,000 new Australian jobs nationwide. In just two years this government has already delivered six new Australian-built naval vessels with another nine under construction, which is creating a pipeline of thousands of jobs which will continue to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our Army modernisation program will create 1,800 direct jobs over the life of the boxer and protected mobile fires program. The Morrison government is investing in our bases and training Australia wide, which is supporting local jobs in construction, maintenance, subcontracted work and supply chains. Through local industry capability plans for major construction contracts around 80 per cent of all subcontracts are now going to local companies right across our nation.

            I'm very proud of the work Defence as also Minister Price is doing to assist defence industry in this very difficult time. Defence has fast-tracked nearly $7 billion of invoices to Australian defence industry to help mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, particularly on their workforces. This is not only enabling Australian companies to retain their staff but also to employ other workers who have been impacted by COVID-19. For example, Airbus Australia and Northrop Grumman Australia have taken on more than 100 civil aviation sector engineers and technicians to support maintenance and operations of our ADF aircraft fleets.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Naval Shipbuilding College is working closely with industries affected by COVID-19 to assist their workers reskill for careers in naval shipbuilding. To date over 2½ thousand people have signed up to the Naval Shipbuilding College workforce register to undertake this training. During this time more than 300 new companies have entered the—

               Indeed I can, Senator O'Sullivan. Defence is currently growing and reshaping its workforce to meet new and evolving capability requirements for our nation. As I can personally attest, the ADF is an excellent career for young Australians who wish to serve, whether it be full or part-time. Defence has been incredibly agile throughout COVID-19, adapting its recruitment practices and procedures to allow for online testing and selection.
              </p>
              <p>
               Between March and May this year, Defence Force recruiting applications were up by a staggering 35 per cent compared to the same period last year. The Defence Work Experience Program and our ADF Gap Year program both continue to provide young Australians the opportunity to sample a career in defence. Defence is also attracting an increasingly diverse talent pool through the
