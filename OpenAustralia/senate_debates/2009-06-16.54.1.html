           <dt>
            (i)
           </dt>

            (ii)

           <dd>
            the committee eventually received a response from the Treasurer on 3 February 2009 refusing the committee’s request stating ‘The Treasury is obligated, under contractual agreements … to not disclose or make public any Confidential Information of the other party’,
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (iii)

            on 5 February 2009, Senator the Honourable Ursula Stephens, Parliamentary Secretary for Social Inclusion and the Voluntary Sector, made a statement in the Senate on behalf of the Government that the ‘Treasury is obligated, under contractual agreements … to not disclose or make public any confidential information of the other party’,

           <dt>
            (v)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            the committee again wrote to the Treasurer on 6 February 2009 pointing out that the Senate in passing the order of 4 February 2009, had accepted the judgement of the committee that contractual obligations to consultants did not constitute a valid reason for declining to produce documents because parliamentary privilege overrides any contractual obligations,
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (vi)
           </dt>

            following the response from the Government, the committee wrote to Monash University and Purdue University on 11 February 2009 seeking to work with the universities to protect the intellectual property of the universities while allowing the committee to properly scrutinise the material,
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (viii)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            on 12 February 2009 the committee received correspondence from Purdue University stating that commercial harm to its Global Trade and Analysis Project, would be avoided by the simple purchase of a licence,
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (ix)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            on 19 February 2009 the committee received correspondence from Monash University which stated that ‘The University wishes to assist your Committee in every way possible’,

            (x)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            on 11 March 2009, the Senate made a further order requiring the production of information by 13 March 2009 and specifying that some of the requested information was to be treated as confidential, meaning that any disclosure or use of the information otherwise than in accordance with the order would be a contempt of the Senate and a criminal offence under the
            <i>
             Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987
            </i>
            ,

            (xi)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            on 12 March 2009 the committee again wrote to Monash University informing it of the Senate’s order of 11 March 2009 and seeking to establish whether the protections afforded by the Senate sufficiently protected the university’s intellectual property in relation to the Monash Multi Regional Forecasting model,
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (xii)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            on 17 March 2009 Senator Stephens made a further statement to the Senate in response to the Senate order of 11 March 2009, in which she stated ‘the government continues to believe that the provision of the proprietary model code and data related to the modelling conducted for
            <i>
             Australia’s low pollution future: the economics of climate change mitigation
            </i>
            would cause commercial harm to organisations that were contracted to assist Treasury’,

           <dt>
            (xiii)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            the committee received further correspondence from Monash University on 18 March 2009 attaching a letter the university had sent to the Treasurer which stated that ‘Monash University waives its requirements of confidentiality on the basis that confidentiality is protected under the provisions of Order SJ61-11 March 2009’,
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (xiv)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            following receipt of the 18 March 2009 correspondence from Monash University, the committee wrote to the Treasurer on 18 March 2009 once again requesting the relevant information and reiterating the committee’s judgement ‘that contractual obligations to consultants do not constitute a valid reason for declining to produce information’ and pointing out that ‘given the information is required under an order of the Senate, parliamentary privilege overrides any relevant contractual obligations of the government’,
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (xv)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            the committee heard evidence from the Department of the Treasury on 2 April 2009 stating that it was the Government’s position that ‘there is potential for commercial harm for aspects of the information to be provided’, and
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (xvi)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            following this evidence provided by the Department of the Treasury, and in the absence of a response to the Treasurer’s letter of 18 March 2009, the committee again wrote to the Treasurer on 3 April 2009 seeking the information as ordered by the Senate on 11 March 2009 and stating that the committee views the response from the Government and the Department of the Treasury ‘as unnecessarily bureaucratic, baseless and deliberately unhelpful to the Committee’;
           </dd>
          </dl>
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (c)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          that the committee has gone to considerable lengths and provided robust protections to accommodate any issues of potential commercial harm to Monash University and Purdue University;
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (d)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          that the Government has failed to respond to either the committee’s letters of 18 March 2009 and 3 April 2009;
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (e)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          that the Government has failed to provide any information to the committee despite the considerable efforts taken by the committee to avoid any commercial harm, and the Government’s claim of commercial harm only applying to some of the information sought; and
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (f)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          that the Government has failed to provide any explanation to the Senate or the committee as to why the remainder of the information was not provided or responded to the fact that Monash University has informed both the committee and the Treasurer that the university is prepared to waive its requirements of confidentiality in accordance with the order of the Senate of 11 March 2009.
