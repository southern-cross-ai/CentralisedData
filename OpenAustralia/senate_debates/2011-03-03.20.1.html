         Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is nothing in this Schedule of the Bill that requires urgent passage. This is unlike the situation regarding its predecessor, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Television" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Television
        </a>
        ) Bill 2010, which during its final passage in the Senate on 24 June 2010 required to be passed for the Mildura / Sunraysia analog switch-off to go ahead just 6 days later on 30 June 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Schedule 1
        </b>
        of this Bill is likely to represent the only time for Parliamentary scrutiny of the principles guiding the most important spectrum allocation for broadcasting for decades. The guidelines to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
         ACMA
        </a>
        governing the process of this reallocation and subsequent sale of freed up spectrum were withdrawn from the previous Bill on Opposition pressure on 24 June.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        ’s reaction to this was to ‘house’ the vital policy objectives for the Digital Dividend in a Directions Instrument to ACMA not subject to any Parliamentary scrutiny. Schedule 1 of this Bill represents the last opportunity for such important guidelines, which will dominate broadcasting for the foreseeable future and quite possibly fixed wireless aspects of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        , to be considered and, if necessary, have them altered and enshrined in legislation (rather than housed in a Ministerial ACMA Direction) for the public good.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Schedule 2
        </b>
        - In essence, the provisions in this section of the bill deserve further scrutiny as they raise significant issues on the future balance of terrestrial versus satellite services for regional viewers. A Senate Committee provides a unique opportunity for the parliament to scrutinise more broadly the progress on digital switchover to date as well as consumer safeguards for digital switchover in regional Queensland and beyond.

        These Bills requires a quick reporting date as it is crucial that it be passed asap to provide certainty to taxpayers and allow adequate time for software providers, businesses, employers and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        to prepare their systems for the new financial year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the legislation does not commence until 1 July 2011, the ATO, employers and their software providers need to have certainty ahead of time to get systems in place, such as new withholding schedules and updated software. Delaying passage could mean these systems are not in place for the commencement of the levy. Taxpayers also need to have this certainty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All of the affected parts of the community will have to come to terms with the workings of the levy, adjust their payroll systems (in the case of employers, many of whom will rely on payroll software providers), and understand whether they may qualify for an exemption (for flood affected taxpayers) before 1 July 2011.
