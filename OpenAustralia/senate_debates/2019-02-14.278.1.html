        53. Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.

       <p class="italic">
        Amendment (1)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The effect of this amendment is to permit the regulations to prescribe different charges or methods depending on the value of industrial chemicals introduced by a person during a financial year, rather than a registration year. It is covered by section 53 because the bill is a proposed law imposing taxation.
