       <p>
        I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Community Development Program) Bill 2018. Labor will not be supporting the bill. In our remote
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        communities far from labour markets, jobs are scarce and sometimes non-existent. The design of these programs has been constantly changing as governments of both persuasions have tried to manage and balance the rights and responsibilities in what is really an artificial labour market.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has created a program called the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP" rel="nofollow">
         CDP
        </a>
        , the Community Development Program. Of the 35,000 participants, around 85 per cent are First Nations people. This government has sold the rights to manage the program in communities to the private sector, to big foreign owned companies like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAX" rel="nofollow">
         MAX
        </a>
        Employment. The program settings, designed in Canberra and rolled out in the bush, are fatally flawed, as the Senate committee report has shown. The penalty regime for breaches of the program is ruthless, draconian and discriminatory. It creates hardship and hunger for kids in communities where there are breaches. Being off an income for four weeks is certainly not humane.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the CDP was introduced, the number of financial penalties applied to people in remote areas has increased sevenfold, from 5,900 per quarter to 45,000 per quarter. By comparison, jobactive has fewer financial penalties for participants per quarter on average, at 37,000, despite being a program which has 20 times more people. The impact of these financial penalties on the most disadvantaged, marginalised people in Australia is well known to our communities. It leads to overcrowding, to family violence and to poor health.
       </p>
       <p>
        This coalition government promised substantial reform to CDP. The bill is not that substantial reform. The bill does not fix the real problems but does tamper around the edges. If the bill were to pass, it would create more hardships. Our approach if we were to legislate, from the Labor point of view, would be to underpin greater empowerment of local communities in administration and management; provide quarantined funding for the benefit of the Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        communities managing the program; separate out the mainstream policy and administration scheme to confine it to a discrete Aboriginal community; focus upon wage parity and conditions; and focus the scheme upon community development and training. The current CDP is a failure, and the government's proposed amendments will make it worse. Labor will not support this legislation.

         I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Community Development Program) Bill 2018 as well.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          The Greens
         </a>
         oppose this bill. We are highly critical of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP" rel="nofollow">
          CDP
         </a>
         program and have opposed it since it started because of its discriminatory nature. This bill entrenches that discriminatory nature despite the government saying it's better. The fact is that different rules will apply to people living in remote communities, and let's face it: those are overwhelmingly Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people. The bill still entrenches discrimination, because different rules will apply to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote communities. The number of hours that will be required will be reduced from 25 to 20, but that will be for 46 weeks of the year—in other words, most of the year—and it starts immediately, whereas in the broader community, the broader Work for the Dole program, it's 15 hours, you don't start for 12 months and it's for six months of the year. So it's discriminatory in its very nature.
        </p>
        <p>
         We believe that the program should be scrapped. We believe that there is a need for reform. We start from the Aboriginal Peak Organisations
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         submission to the committee but also their much broader proposal that has been out there for a while—and they did submit it to the committee review of this bill. They have a much more supportive, less punitive, less top-down approach that would genuinely deliver funding for training and jobs. Along with this proposal go 6,000 subsidised jobs. Firstly, the community is very clearly calling for community wages and to go to an approach similar to that of the former program, CDEP. So the government has not delivered what the community asked for in the first place. Secondly, the job opportunities just aren't there in these communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         This program seeks to apply the targeted compliance framework, commonly known as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCF" rel="nofollow">
          TCF
         </a>
         , which the CDP participants were exempt from when the welfare reform bill went through. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are subject to CDP will unfortunately have much more interaction with the system, so they'll have more chances to be subjected to compliance failure and will end up in the basket where very significant penalties apply which are not able to be waived. So, from every front that you look at this, it is bad legislation and should be opposed.

          I'm pleased also to have an opportunity to contribute on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Community Development Program) Bill. Along with a number of other senators in this chamber, including Senator McAllister, Senator Dodson and Senator Siewert, I participated in the inquiry conducted by the Finance and Public Administration References Committee into the Community Development Program. I found that to be an enlightening and very useful process. I attended the committee's hearings in Kalgoorlie, Townsville and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Palm Island
          </a>
          . There's no question that, through the committee, the government received very valuable feedback on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP" rel="nofollow">
           CDP
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the things I took out of that inquiry process and the evidence we received was that there was substantial feedback to the government on the running of the program, particularly the administration of the program, the frustrations some people had in dealing with Centrelink and the breaches regime. Overwhelmingly, the evidence was that everybody agreed the principle of mutual obligation is important and should stay and that we should never go back to the system, as it has been in the past, of passive welfare because of the shocking damage it has done to remote and regional communities and, in particular, Indigenous communities. I cannot remember a witness from a remote or regional area, from an Indigenous community, who said they thought it was a good idea to go back to passive welfare or it was a good idea to get rid of mutual obligation altogether.
         </p>
         <p>
          On one level, I'm not surprised to see the Greens come into the chamber and say they're going to oppose this bill. They're unconvinced about the concept of mutual obligation full stop. They are unconvinced about the idea that people should need to work in exchange for receiving welfare. But the Labor Party is not. The Labor Party says that they support the concept of mutual obligation—that they understand the need to have work requirements in exchange for receiving welfare—yet, as we heard from Senator Dodson, they are opposing this bill. I accept that the Labor Party might not agree with every recommendation the government has adopted. I accept that there may be a different path that they would like to take with the CDP, and, should they have the opportunity of forming government in the future, they, of course, will have the opportunity to do that. But what they are doing today is standing in the way of reforms that the communities we heard from asked us to implement. The Labor Party are saying that the program should stay as it is today until they have an opportunity to perhaps rewrite it in the future. I think that is a mistake.
         </p>
         <p>
          This bill brings forward reforms to one of the most important priorities for Aboriginal and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
           Torres Strait Islander
          </a>
          communities. Communities are strong when adults are engaged in work or meaningful activities that contribute to the benefit of the community. Since its introduction in July 2015, the Community Development Program has improved employment and participation outcomes for remote jobseekers. The CDP has supported remote jobseekers into more than 26,200 jobs, and on more than 8,800 occasions they have stayed in a job for at least six months. The CDP turned around the failings of the Remote Jobs and Communities Program, which had replaced the previous Community Development Employment Projects, or the CDEP. The Remote Jobs and Communities Program allowed the return of the misery of sit-down money, and engagement dropped to a shocking rate of seven per cent. The CDP has worked because it ensures that jobseekers have real mutual obligation requirements and because communities are increasingly at the heart of the delivery of the program. While the CDP is successfully getting jobseekers off welfare and into work, the government does recognise that there are areas of the system that can be improved.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government has listened to the outcomes of the Senate inquiry process, as I mentioned, including the submissions and the public hearings, where many stakeholders took the opportunity to voice their views and concerns, including the Aboriginal peak organisations of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
           Northern Territory
          </a>
          , as Senator Siewert mentioned. The government has also taken on board the Australian National Audit Office's performance audit outcomes. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
           Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
          </a>
          released a discussion paper in December 2017 which received 40 public submissions and which provided a range of constructive views and suggestions. What we hear from the community, what people are asking for, is this: more jobs in remote Australia, access to real wages, reduced complexity in the income support system, and simplified actions with Centrelink. We have heard the consistent message that jobseekers need to be engaged to ensure that there is a clear pathway to a job and that the misery of passive welfare does not return. These CDP reforms create a fairer and simpler system, provide more local control, and drive a focus on employment and engagement with jobseekers. The introduction of the targeted compliance framework will significantly reduce the number of breaches, and that is one of the key pieces of evidence that we heard from communities during the hearings.
         </p>
         <p>
          Critics of the program, particularly from the east coast, who are often driving a lot of the media coverage about this program, can't have it all. They can't, on the one hand, complain that the current CDP doesn't work and then use that same data to block the reforms that we're proposing, which would create a simpler and fairer system. They are standing in the way of improvements to a system that they say needs improvements.
         </p>
         <p>
          On 8 May 2018 the government announced reforms to the CDP as part of the 2018-19 budget. There are three key changes to the program and they include, firstly, reducing income reporting requirements to Centrelink for jobseekers who have a mutual obligation of less than 15 hours a week. We certainly heard the frustrations of many remote communities in dealing with Centrelink. We've heard that concern and we are responding to it. Secondly, we're improving the assessment process so that barriers to employment are better identified and local health workers can provide the medical evidence needed to reduce the required participation. This is another key theme of the feedback that we received during the inquiry—that often it was other failings of government, and sometimes at different levels, and other systems have let them down, which was preventing proper participation and engagement with the CDP. So anything we can do within the CDP to help respond to those other issues will help the success of the CDP. Thirdly, we're reducing required participation from up to 25 hours a week to up to 20 hours a week.
         </p>
         <p>
          These changes will commence, if the bill is successful, from February 2019. What they will do is support local control and decision-making through a much more community based approach. We are strengthening the community and the say that they have in how the CDP is delivered locally by contracting with more Indigenous service providers and linking with local governance arrangements. I think it's really important that there are excellent Indigenous service providers out there who are keen to be involved in and have a greater say on the delivery of this program in the local area. With the superior local knowledge they have, they will be able to help deliver the program more effectively.
         </p>
         <p>
          Importantly, the government will work with local communities to support 6,000 subsidised jobs across remote Australia. This will provide access to real wages and it will move people off welfare and into work. These will be jobs in community, identified by community, and delivering for the community's needs. Things like housing managers, local government workers, community health support, teaching assistants, construction or aged care are some examples of the kinds of jobs that could be delivered under this program. These jobs will only be available to CDP participants. They will help grow the size and capacity of the remote labour market and support the development of more local businesses and more local economies. I take up Senator Dodson's point that the labour market in a lot of remote and regional areas is in many ways an artificial labour market, and we should do whatever we can to help create the ecosystem for a stronger and more genuine economic activity and a proper local jobs market.
         </p>
         <p>
          The subsidised jobs package is part of a pathway to employment, and it will provide real work experience for jobseekers while also paying them real wages. Again, that is one of the consistent pieces of feedback we received during the inquiry: people want real jobs and they want to be paid real wages. That's fair enough, and we are taking a step to achieve that. Jobseekers will continue to access support from employers and CDP providers to help them to stay in a job for the long term, which is critically important. It's no good getting people into a job that doesn't last very long. It's no good getting them into a job that lasts only a few months. We want to get them into permanent, long-lasting jobs and continued employment.
         </p>
         <p>
          These jobs will provide meaningful employment, and the participants will be subject to the same pay and conditions that would otherwise be attached to those positions. Many participants who are placed in these jobs will continue to also qualify for the reduced rate of their income support payments after the applicable income test is applied. Some of these participants will not have had a job before or they may have been unemployed for quite some time. They might also need some additional support in making the transition into the workplace. We want these participants to succeed in taking that pathway to meet their career goals and their aspirations. That's why we are removing from them all of the other requirements that would usually apply under social security law. That's so their focus can be on attaining and retaining that meaningful real employment.
         </p>
         <p>
          The subsidised job program complements what's in the legislation before the Senate today, but it will also be at the heart of the CDP going forward and the pathway to a job. Under the CDP going forward there will be, as I mentioned, 6,000 remote jobseekers being supported into a job at any time. This is a really exciting change and one that allows communities to support more jobs for locals and to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not only engaged in work but also more engaged in the delivery of services to their own communities. The reforms build on the early successes of the CDP and continue to drive employment in remote Australia by helping to improve the skills and employability of jobseekers, increasing their participation through a greater range of work-like activities in the community.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill before us today amends the social security law to support the introduction of a new targeted compliance framework in remote Australia consistent with the arrangements across the rest of Australia. Following the passage of this bill, if it is successful, the CDP participants will be subject to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCF" rel="nofollow">
           TCF
          </a>
          . This means that there will be one national jobseeker compliance framework for all jobseekers, both remote and nonremote. I think that, in part, addresses the concerns that Senator Siewert was raising—that a different system applies to remote and regional jobseekers, who, as she says, are predominantly
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
           Indigenous Australians
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The TCF commenced across jobactive, ParentsNext and Disability Employment Services on 1 July 2018—the rest of the welfare system—and it will commence in the CDP from February 2019, if this bill is successful. CDP jobseekers will see considerable changes in how they interact with providers and Centrelink. The new TCF has additional protections for vulnerable jobseekers. It reduces the interactions with Centrelink, which is again responding to the concerns that we heard directly from communities about being frustrated in their dealings with Centrelink, and builds in more checkpoints to ensure that all jobseekers are fully capable of meeting their requirements. We want jobseekers to be successful in meeting their requirements; we don't want them to breach them. We don't want them to spend their time interacting with Centrelink when it's not necessary. There will be a greater role, importantly, for local CDP providers, who are on the ground and closer to the communities and know them better, to work with the CDP participants in the application of the TCF. That will mean there will be less interaction with Centrelink compared to the current framework. That will mean less time waiting on the phone, which, as we heard from many remote jobseekers during the inquiry, they find to be a very frustrating experience.
         </p>
         <p>
          The reforms will see a significant reduction in the number of penalties applied to CDP jobseekers. The introduction of the TCF will remove penalties for one-off breaches of mutual obligation requirements, and financial penalties will focus on those who are persistently and wilfully noncompliant. Again, we heard about the impact that breaches have on participants in the program and also local communities. Breaches should not be applied unless they are persistently and wilfully noncomplaint. They shouldn't apply for occasional noncompliance or incidental or accidental noncompliance. They should really be focused only on those wilful and persistent noncompliant participants in the program.
         </p>
         <p>
          To assist CDP participants in meeting their requirements, mutual obligation hours—as I mentioned earlier—will be reduced from up to 25 hours per week to up to 20 hours a week, and that will depend on the jobseekers' assessed work capacity. Alongside the application of the TCF, the reforms include a number of changes to increase the role of local health service providers to support participants in their communities. As I said earlier, participation in the CDP is often hampered by other issues with government service delivery in the community. The more we can help the people participate in the program and remove those barriers to participation, the more likely it is that the CDP will also succeed. Changes will include, for example, the provision of local health workers to supply evidence for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Human Services
          </a>
          to use when deciding whether to reduce a participant's mutual obligation hours.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill also introduces specific exemptions for participants in subsidised employment, removing interactions with Centrelink and focusing on engagement with the employers. Participants in subsidised employment will be exempt from the activity test requirements and will not incur mutual obligation failures under the TCF. This seeks to emulate one of the positive aspects of the old CDEP, where participants were paid wages outside of the income support system. We heard a lot of affection for that former program, the CDEP, which was abolished by the former Labor government and replaced by the remote jobs scheme. Crucially, entry into subsidised work will be voluntary. Therefore, CDP participants who for any reason refuse an offer of subsidised employment will not incur a work refusal failure. This provides CDP participants with the freedom to determine whether the subsidised employment opportunity available to them suits their personal commitments, their career aspirations, their skills and their experience. CDP participants will continue to have appropriate JobSearch requirements as part of their mutual obligation requirements determined by their provider. Similarly, participants in subsidised employment will not be subject to a work refusal failure if they refuse an offer of suitable unsubsidised employment.
         </p>
         <p>
          Participants in subsidised employment will also not be subject to an unemployment failure if they voluntarily leave their position or are dismissed due to misconduct. This approach provides participants with the opportunity to leave subsidised employment without penalty if, after commencement of the position, they determine that the role is not suitable for them or their personal circumstances—for example, due to a requirement to relocate or family violence. As each subsidised position is funded for two years, this will also free up the subsidised job opportunity for a jobseeker who may be better suited to the role. This bill ensures that the local community is at the heart of our remote employment services. That was probably one of the main themes that came out of the inquiry: local community control to address local community problems. It listens to local views and local priorities, will be delivered by local community organisations, will ensure local jobseekers are engaged and better supported, and will provide a clear pathway to a job.
         </p>
         <p>
          Without this legislation, though, the government will not be able to fully deliver the subsidised employment program as participants will still be subject to compliance under social security laws. I assume that would be a seriously unintended consequence of the decision by other parties in this chamber to vote against it. I presume they don't want the existing compliance regime to apply to subsidised workers, but that will be the effect if they follow through on their decision to vote against this legislation in the chamber. Without this legislation, CDP participants will continue to be subject to a different compliance model than the rest of Australia. We heard from Senator Siewert earlier that one of the Greens' criticisms of this system is that people in remote communities, who are predominantly Indigenous, are subject to a different set of rules than the rest of Australia. This bill attempts to bring it more closely into line with the requirements for other welfare recipients around Australia, and the Greens are proposing to vote against it. The legislation ensures remote jobseekers will have the support they need to move along the pathway to work. I hope the Greens and Labor reconsider their opposition to it.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to make one final point about consultation. The minister has personally visited more than 200 communities since the commencement of the CDP. The government has listened to the outcomes of the Senate inquiry process, which I have talked about, including the submissions and the public hearings, where many stakeholders took the opportunity to voice their views and concerns about the program. This process of consultation has not finished. We will continue to consult with remote communities, remote jobseekers and Indigenous leaders as we work to implement these reforms. It is a little bit disappointing that others in this chamber have listened more to academics on the east coast than to the people who live in remote Australia.

           I too rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Community Development Program) Bill 2018. Following on from Senator Paterson, I think it's very important to understand that, when we're talking about Indigenous employment opportunities, this is only one building block in a complete plan to enable every Australian to have the opportunity to find and keep a stable and reasonably paid job. We see right across the economy the work of the minister to try and build the capacity of Indigenous businesses, to employ
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           and to build the capacity of other businesses to do so. We see changes to things like the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP" rel="nofollow">
            CDP
           </a>
           to try and enable the building blocks to be put in place to grow the economic base, particularly in those remote communities where the economic base isn't necessarily available to sustain long-term, well-paid jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
           But part of the problem in that regard is that, in order to develop the economic base, particularly in remote and regional Australia, we actually need to have development. Recently, in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           , we had the Thunderbird project in the Pilbara, which has, thank goodness, recently gained its final environmental approval and heritage approval, but the process took far too long and was far too expensive. Why is that relevant to this bill? Because one of the commitments that Thunderbird made to communities in that remote part of Western Australia was that 40 per cent of their workforce—a significant workforce—were going to come from the local Indigenous communities. That is what we want to do. That's what this government wants to do. We want to build capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was talking to the mayor of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Laverton" rel="nofollow">
            Shire of Laverton
           </a>
           about work being done on the

            Outback Way
           </a>
           . They have a road building contractor team, construction companies and Indigenous-run businesses employing local people to do the work and to deliver long-term, sustainable jobs. We have to grow the economic base of the regions and grow the economic base in rural and regional Australia, and to do that we need development.
          </p>
          <p>
           The CDP is an important part of allowing people to gain some skills and experience, but it is part of a series of building blocks which we need to put in place in order to give people the opportunity they deserve to build a better life for themselves; to stay on their country, if that's what they choose to do; and to stay engaged with their friends and families, if that's where they choose to stay. But, in order to do that, we actually need development. We actually need real jobs out in the regions. So I certainly support this bill. It is a building block for what we need to do.
          </p>
          <p>
           I will go through some of the detail of the bill, but, before I do so, I want to talk about some of the other things that have been done in this space and some of the other things which the minister, in particular, and this government have been focused on. The support we provide to growing the Indigenous business sector is fundamental, as I've said. It is vitally important that people both see success stories and find a path to work through those success stories, through those businesses. I will again go back to a case in WA. I met with Minister Scullion a couple of times recently. There is an electrical business located in Fremantle, Western Australia, called Wilko. This business has a really strong focus on Indigenous employment. They are doing great things. They are providing apprenticeships in the Indigenous employment space. They have gained support from the government in order to grow their business, to keep those people in jobs employed and to get the training they need to actually build better lives. The whole point of growing the Indigenous business sector is to create more jobs and to provide economic independence, which is so vital to a successful future.
          </p>
          <p>
           Growing the Indigenous business sector doesn't happen in isolation; it happens in the framework of generally good government policy settings. We've seen a commitment in the other place, and we saw it here this morning, locking in those tax cuts and accelerating those tax cuts for small and medium-sized businesses. It helps all businesses, including Indigenous businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have seen, through this government's Indigenous Procurement Policy, a drive in demand for those services from Indigenous businesses. That is tapping into the extraordinary capabilities that those businesses can provide and that haven't always been as well recognised in the past as perhaps they should have been. This is an example of how government policy can actually help spread the word and give those businesses an opportunity. Since the Indigenous Procurement Policy was launched, the Commonwealth has purchased just over $1 billion worth of goods and services from or through Indigenous businesses. That is over $1 billion, up from just $6.2 million in 2012-13. That alone is a remarkable achievement and is delivering positive impacts on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
           Through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, the government is supporting around 58 jobs per day for Aboriginal and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
            Torres Strait Islander
           </a>
           s. It is not just in employment that we are making a difference for Aboriginal and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders" rel="nofollow">
            Torres Strait Islanders
           </a>
           . By supporting education we are also giving Indigenous children the best possible start in life. Through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS" rel="nofollow">
            IAS
           </a>
           , the government is investing over $220 million in 2018-19 to improve education outcomes from early childhood and schooling through to higher education. In secondary schools, we have committed more than $400 million since the start of IAS in activities to help over 25,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people to stay engaged with the education system. Obviously, a key part of building an individual's capacity over time is to keep kids engaged with the education system.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's also important that people live in a safe environment. Through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, we have invested around $245 million in 2018-19, including funding for 14 specialist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander family violence prevention legal services. These services supported around 4,000 victims of family violence last year. That $245 million, through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, funded community night patrols, operating across 81 communities in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           , nine in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           and one in Western Australia. That employed a total of 403 patrollers, of which 96 per cent are Indigenous. We have continued to support, through this Indigenous Advancement Strategy, the rollout of low-aromatic fuel.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Since_October" rel="nofollow">
            Since October
           </a>
           2013 a total of 46 new sites have been added and have started stocking the lower-aromatic fuel, taking the total number of sites around Australia to 175.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government is also supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander jobseekers in remote areas through a number of new business initiatives. The Indigenous Entrepreneurs Capital Scheme, which I did speak about earlier, is a $90 million facility within the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, which provides one-off grants for the purchase or lease of business plant and equipment, as well as tailored business advice to assist businesses to identify opportunities, plan for sustainability and access appropriate commercial finance. It is exclusively for Indigenous businesses in regional and remote areas, unlocking business opportunities for jobseekers in those areas. The plan there is that you build up the businesses and give them the capacity to employ more people. They will then employ more Indigenous people. They will, in that way, grow the capacity of the entire communities.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government has also announced that it is investing an additional just over $3 million in Indigenous Business Australia to deliver start-up grant, loan and lease packages over the next 12 months to Indigenous customers in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Land_Rights_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Aboriginal Land Rights Act
           </a>
           areas, community living areas and remote native title areas of the Northern Territory. As part of those packages,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBA" rel="nofollow">
            IBA
           </a>
           will provide tailored assistance in the form of ongoing management activities to support Indigenous business growth and a capital mix of low-interest rate loans and/or low-interest lease plus grants up to a combined value of $100,000 per customer.
          </p>
          <p>
           Additionally, the Commonwealth government supports remote businesses through Many Rivers Microfinance Limited. Many Rivers Microfinance is funded by the IAS to deliver micro-enterprise development support to approximately 800 Indigenous entrepreneurs in remote areas and economic development support to local remote Indigenous community organisations in 40 locations over the next three years. Once again, you can see this is part of the government's plan to put the building blocks in place to actually develop the economic base out there in remote and rural Australia, particularly, to give those communities a chance to have long-term, sustainable jobs that pay a decent wage and can give people a long-term path to employment.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government is also assisting Indigenous businesses in the construction industry, who face unique challenges because many projects need a construction guarantee in order to win work. These requirements present a significant barrier to entry, particularly for those businesses that are in remote areas or may not have a large book of projects in front of them. The new $20 million performance and warranty bond facility, which Indigenous construction firms can use to win road and construction contracts, has been introduced. Again, we see these kinds of businesses already in operation in building parts of the Outback Way.
          </p>
          <p>
           So the package of reforms to the CDP builds on all these other things that we are doing in the space of Indigenous employment. They were developed directly in response to feedback from communities and will increase support to vulnerable jobseekers in remote Australia, providing more pathways to jobs, moving people off welfare and into jobs, and improving outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to go to some of the detail in the bill. In particular, I wish to address in detail the Targeted Compliance Framework. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCF" rel="nofollow">
            TCF
           </a>
           is a demerit point system where jobseekers incur demerits through noncompliance with their mutual obligation requirements but generally no financial penalties in the initial stages. The TCF is split into three zones: the green zone, where there are no demerits; the warning zone, where there are one to five demerits in a six-month period; and the penalty zone. Generally that means more than five demerits within a six-month period. Once a jobseeker has accrued five demerits in six months, financial penalties may start to apply for latent noncompliance. However, the jobseeker will have two separate assessments before this point. This is very important: jobseekers can move back into the green zone by consistently meeting their mutual obligations. Obviously, all jobseekers will commence in the green zone with no demerits. If a jobseeker in the green zone fails to meet a mutual obligation requirement, the provider must speak with the jobseeker following each event of noncompliance to discuss if the jobseeker had a valid reason for not attending. If so, they would generally have the requirement rescheduled, but the accrued demerit is removed and any payment is unsuspended and back-paid. If there is no valid reason for noncompliance, the accrued demerit is confirmed and the jobseeker's payments remain suspended until they re-engage with their missed requirement, although there are exceptions to this.
          </p>
          <p>
           After three demerits in the warning zone, a capability interview is triggered between the jobseeker and their provider. The capability interview is an additional protection for the jobseeker. The provider is required to meet again with the jobseeker to ensure that they are fully capable of meeting their current requirements and understand their obligations. The interview provides the opportunity for the jobseeker to disclose circumstances that may be impacting their ability to meet their requirements. It also ensures that providers consider the jobseeker's requirement against their level of capability, anything which might be affecting their ability to comply, any other supports they may need, their personal circumstances, their skills and the local labour market. Providers must discuss recent noncompliance and ensure that the jobseeker understands that ongoing noncompliance could result in financial penalties. If it is found that the jobseeker is not capable of successfully meeting their job plan or does not understand the requirements, a reconsideration of requirements for the jobseeker is required. This can occur if a newly disclosed—
