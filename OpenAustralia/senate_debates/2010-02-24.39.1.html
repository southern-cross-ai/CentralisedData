        , my question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sherry. Is the Assistant Treasurer aware of the latest analysis from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         International Monetary Fund
        </a>
        on exit strategies from the global recession? Can the Assistant Treasurer inform the Senate on how this independent analysis of the global response to the world’s worst synchronised economic downturn in 75 years relates to the Rudd government’s timely, targeted and temporary response to the crisis?

          Senator Abetz would do better to look at the performance of Senator Barnaby Joyce this morning in the media. I understand it is well worth a look. The

           IMF
          </a>
          , a very respected international economic forecaster and analyser, has released a document called
          <i>
           Exiting from crisis intervention policies
          </i>
          . The executive directors of the IMF noted:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The bold and extraordinary measures taken in response to the crisis have helped lessen the severity of the global recession and stabilised financial markets, allowing normality to return in many countries.
         </p>
         <p>
          That, of course, would be the bold and decisive action that the Rudd Labor government took to introduce stimulus at the onset of the crisis.

             Senator Fielding
            </a>
            and Senator Xenophon—but the strong opposition of the Liberal and National parties to that stimulus package. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
             IMF
            </a>
            also cautions in its report that ‘available data does not advocate a broad based withdrawal of stimulus’. It is warning against too rapid a withdrawal of stimulus. It also notes that the ‘recovery still appears sluggish’, Senator Joyce. It still appears sluggish ‘especially in advanced economies, and there is little evidence that private demand is self-sustaining’. Importantly, the IMF says:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Letting the fiscal stimulus expire should be straightforward from a technical standpoint because much of the stimulus has consisted of temporary measures.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is true of Australia. Our stimulus peaked last year and has a phase-out within it. As the Rudd government has said from day one, stimulus measures have been timely, targeted—

                   state what fiscal measures government should take to reduce their debt levels? Are there obstacles to the Rudd government’s plans for fiscal restraint—in particular, the Rudd government’s initiatives to help Australia meet the challenges of a growing and ageing population?

I can tell you one thing: I will give Mr Costello a compliment. If you look at Senator Joyce, if you look at Mr Hockey and if you look at Mr Abbott, Mr Costello is a three-time winner of the
