        My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Senator Birmingham. Can the minister outline how the Morrison government's $76 million bushfire recovery package is helping to support affected communities?

         I thank Senator

          McGrath
         </a>
         for his question. Senator McGrath is a passionate Queenslander with a passionate interest in the tourism industry. I thank Senator McGrath in particular for the many representations and the feedback that he's been providing to me in terms of the impact of the coronavirus especially and also the reputational impact in relation to bushfires on Queensland tourism businesses—as have so many coalition members.

         The government, as is well known, has applied a $76 million step-up in terms of tourism funding. Many have commented that this, so far as they're aware, is the single largest additional investment made in Australian tourism by an Australian government, in terms of support for recovery during this time. In implementing this package, the government is seeking to activate increased domestic tourism through a $20 million campaign, and we are particularly working to help states and territories, who will receive the bulk of that $20 million funding. Matching money is on the table for those states and territories, so they step up and put in extra money and we put in extra money. Today we will also release guidelines for the regional grants program. The regional grants program is a $10 million component of the $76 million package specifically for fire affected communities. Those communities are in a position to be able to invest in regional events, in other promotional activities, and quickly secure grants under this program to lift and boost visitation especially during non-peak periods. Those non-peak periods are important to make sure that we lift and make up for the loss in visitation that has occurred and is occurring. We note that the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus have had a continual slowdown impact on many regions across Australia, including some of those fire affected regions. That's why it's important that we get the investment of this funding absolutely right.

            As I indicated, the bulk of the $20 million in funding is available for the states and territories. I welcome those states that have made the decision to put in matching funding, which helps to nearly double the commitment that is already there in terms of the partnerships that exist. I welcome the fact that companies such as Qantas, Virgin, Jetstar,

            Kings and Rydges have all come on board and are partnering with

             Tourism Australia
            </a>
            in seeking to drive the sale of products and help lift travel across Australia. I note the fact that the 'Holiday Here This Year' campaign has featured on cover-wraps across 24 Australian newspapers, 376 advertising panels, 53 airport screens and advertisements in over 600 office towers. It has been broadcast on radio nearly 3,000 times and a bonus of nearly 12½ thousand free charge spots. I thank the many Australian media outlets for providing free or discounted space to help us get campaign-reach further and drive taxpayer dollars further in our support for tourism businesses.

               It is early days still and, in terms of a recovery in those international markets, we see globally a downward trend in terms of international travel. This is not a problem affecting just Australia; it is a problem affecting visitation and travel right around the world as a result of coronavirus. I heard the interjections before from those opposite. I was on the

               the week before last talking to tourism providers there, and I know that they are hurting intensely. Let me make it very clear: they are hurting for a range of reasons that some of those opposite seem to ignore. Getting road access from Victoria up into some of those South Coast communities has been ongoing work. It is a real problem. We have been offering additional resources to the Victorian government to get those roads open. Frankly, those opposite ought to deal in the reality of the challenges that are there. And we are working—
