         I thank the Senate. I should explain that the Greens are not supporting this suite of motions from Senator Cormann, although we support the active component of it. I have spoken with the good senator about this. We do not agree with the preamble. Without going into detail, it is a politically loaded preamble. There are assertions amongst motions 4, 5 and 6 that we cannot back without going into a long debate in this place. While we are in support of the active component, to support these motions would be to support the information asserted by Senator Cormann in the lead-up to that active component. We cannot in this situation do that. That is why we are opposing the motions.

            A committee of the Senate and individual senators have sought access to information for three months now in relation to key assumptions which underpin the government’s estimates for mining tax revenue. The government has for three months declined to provide that information—without any proper claim of public interest immunity and without providing a proper statement of reasons as to why the release of that information would not be in the public interest. It is not earth-shattering information that we are seeking either. The first motion relates to the commodity price, production volume and exchange rate assumptions used by the government. Changes in assumptions between the original mining tax and the revised mining tax had a significant impact on the revenue estimate outcome, yet the government continues to keep those assumptions secret. We think the release of that information is critical for the Senate and the public to be able to properly scrutinise the impact of this tax. It is information which, for example, state governments of both persuasions in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Western Australia
            </a>
            publish as a matter of course in their budget papers. I do not understand why the government is treating this as if it is a national security related state secret. As such, I commend those motions to the Senate—particularly in the context of the stated commitment from the government to a new era of openness and transparency which has been asserted by the Prime Minister on a number of occasions.

                 I thank the Senate. I will give an instance of why it is difficult to support the preamble. It begins with ‘that the Senate notes that the executive director of the Revenue Group had not assessed where certain revenue would come from’. Straight after that it says, ‘despite repeated requests since, the government has refused to provide that information’. On the one hand ‘it has not been assessed’, and on the other hand the government is being asked to provide it. It is not good drafting, it is inherently nonsense, and a much shorter preamble would do. Again, we support the active component, but it is not clear what the preamble means. It is not logical and it ought to have been put more clearly.

                    This issue was the subject of two lengthy Senate fuel and energy committee hearings with Dr Henry. During those meetings Dr Henry and senior Treasury officials were asked whether they were able to identify where the mining tax revenue would come from by state and territory on the basis that the Regional Infrastructure Fund, which had been committed in the context of this tax, would be allocated proportionally to where the money was raised from. We asked the obvious question: are you able to assess this? Treasury told us it would not be a difficult piece of analysis to do, and they took it on notice. When the answers on notice came back, the government essentially declined to provide that information. After Treasury took the question on notice and senior Treasury officials told us it would not be difficult to identify this information, the government made this decision, I would suggest, because they did not want the people in

                    and Queensland in particular to know how much of the mining tax revenue would come from those states. The government made a decision to decline to provide that information. We think it is in the public interest for that information to be provided so that, again, the impact of this particular tax on the economy, on jobs, on the budget and on individual states and territories can be properly assessed.

                       In relation to motions 4, 5 and 6 moved by Senator Cormann, I note that the government opposed those motions. However, we recognise that the opposition had the support of at least Senators Xenophon and Fielding and therefore had the majority. So the government did not call for a division.
