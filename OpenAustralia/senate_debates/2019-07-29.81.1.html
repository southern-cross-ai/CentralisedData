        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Birmingham. I refer to Minister Taylor's claim that a letter from farm organisations dated 3 October 2017 is evidence he was making constituent representations when he sought a meeting with the Department of the Environment and Energy six months later. How can a letter written six months later inform the purpose of the meeting?

         Once again, I would refer—this time Senator Wong—to the statement made by the member for Hume in the House today. In that statement, he was very clear, speaking about representations and engagements he had with farmers in late 2016 and early 2017 regarding these issues—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Senator Cormann
         <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">
          interjecting
         </a>
         —
        </p>
        <p>
         and, indeed, as Senator Cormann indicates, this was consultation dating back some period of time. This is about a local MP acting on behalf of his local constituents. We know that the only constituents those opposite are interested in acting on behalf of are, of course, their trade union mates. They don't seem to ever listen to local constituents otherwise. They certainly don't listen to the Australians who rejected their type of policy agenda at the last election. But on this side we expect our MPs to listen to their constituents, engage in their issues and, where appropriate, represent them.

           The minister has also tabled a letter from farm organisations sent in 2014 in relation to the listening. Can this minister confirm that Minister Taylor took no action in relation to the issues raised in the letter of 2014 until the day after Jam Land Pty Ltd was advised of its potential contravention of federal environmental laws some three years later?

              Minister Taylor has sought to justify his actions by tabling a letter from three years prior to the meeting, which he didn't act on, and a letter after the meeting. Isn't the truth this: Minister Taylor sought special treatment, and he got it.

               The answer to that is, emphatically: no. As the officials involved have been emphatically clear, at no point have the compliance issues been raised by Minister Taylor or in discussions with Minister Taylor.
