        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        . Minister, can you confirm that, earlier this year, there was a significant disturbance or riot at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        detention centre that involved up to 200 canisters of tear gas being fired into the compound? What was the nature of the disturbance and were there any injuries? What steps were taken to ensure the safety of the family from Biloela who are detained nearby? Was the family, in particular the young children, impacted in any way, including psychologically? What measures has the government taken since to assess the impact on the family, in particular the children, and to ensure their wellbeing?

         I thank Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKim" rel="nofollow">
          McKim
         </a>
         for the question. I understand you are referring to an incident that occurred in February 2021 in which a male detainee was seen on the roof of a building at Villawood detention centre. I will need to take that on notice and get you some further advice. In relation to the Biloela family, we have talked through this before and I think it is one of those issues we will need to agree to disagree on. You would be aware that the judgement by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Court" rel="nofollow">
          Full Court
         </a>
         of the Federal Court was recently delivered. The department is now considering the implications of that decision, as you know.
        </p>
        <p>
         Going back to the history of the Biloela family, I would just remind the chamber that both adults arrived in Australia as illegal maritime arrivals; they paid a people smuggler and arrived in Australia illegally by boat. After arriving in Australia illegally by boat, they met and they had two children. Senator McKim, I know you are aware of these facts, but I will just ensure that we are again placing them on the record. Since 2012, the family's claim to engage Australia's protection obligations has been comprehensively assessed, as you know, and the family has consistently been found not to be owed protection. Again, to the extent that I can, I will seek further information for you in relation to the issue that you raised at the beginning of your question and ensure that you are provided with that information.

            , we're going to have to agree to disagree. You and I have done this dance before, and I don't propose to do the dance again. I need to remind the chamber that a fundamental difference between the Morrison government—those on the coalition side of politics—and, in particular, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">

               , that was the first part of the question. The second part was much more widely written. It was: 'how can you possibly justify?' I think, with respect, that the minister has a lot of discretion in answering such a wide question. I regard that question as quite wide. The first part was quite specific, I grant you. But, in this case, I think the minister's being relevant to the second part of the question.

                  . In regard to your first ruling that the second part of my question was, 'How can you possibly justify this expenditure?'—that is, the expenditure that I referred to in the first part of my supplementary question—I would put to you, respectfully, that, in fact, it's quite a tightly worded question and the minister is not being relevant to it.

                   I do regard the first part of your question as a factual question. The second part of the question asked the minister for an explanation. Your point of order goes to the content or the validity of that explanation, and I think that's a matter for debate after question time.

                      As a final supplementary, I ask the minister to clarify: was she actually saying that she has spent $17 billion imprisoning and in illegal action against the Biloela family? Could you first address that, Minister? Second, why are you ignoring the hundreds of thousands of Australians who've called for this innocent family's release? How much more money will you spend trying to deport them and in needlessly detaining them? Why will you not do the right thing and return them to Biloela, where they are loved and supported?

                       , I'm just going to have to completely reject the premise of your question. In answer to your question, let me just remind you that on this side of the chamber, the Morrison government's side of the chamber, we believe in sovereign borders. We will determine who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. When you refer to the Biloela family, I need to remind you that the principle is this: both adults arrived in Australia—
