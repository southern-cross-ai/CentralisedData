        The amendment will extend the work bonus to other income support recipients. This bill, as we know, creates a work bonus so that age pensioners are able to earn significantly more before their pension gets reduced, which is a good thing; we're supporting this bill. But it really points attention to the fact that you have got people on other income support benefits who aren't getting the same benefit. In fact, they're even more deserving of being able to earn more because their income support is considerably less. Age pensioners get $73 a day, but people on JobSeeker only get $48. This bill will allow age pensioners to earn up to an extra $11,800 in work bonus over a year, but JobSeeker can only earn a work credit of $1,000 before their benefits get slashed. In fact, they face an effective marginal tax rate of somewhere between $60 and $80 for every extra dollar that they earn when they take a few extra available shifts, when they take the opportunity to do the work that's there so they can pay a few bills, so they can get the lawnmower fixed or so they can pay off a loan that somebody has very generously given them.
       </p>
       <p>
        What this amendment would do is to extend that work bonus that we are now going to put into legislation for age pensioners to other income support recipients to allow them also to get the benefits, to allow people on JobSeeker, people on the disability support pension and people on youth allowance to earn more so that they too don't have to suffer the huge increase in the cost of living. It would mean that they might actually, at least in some weeks, be able to scrape by and afford to put food on the table as well as pay the rent and pay for their medical costs.

         I indicate that the government will not support this amendment. The purpose of the bill is to provide the relief and the incentive that have been set out at the Jobs and Skills Summit by the proponents of the bill more broadly in the community and by the government to extend that support to age pensioners and categories of people on veterans payments. The effect of adopting the amendment proposed by the Greens party would be a very significant change to the bill. Indeed, it would take it away from its primary purpose and, in our view, would have unintended consequences. I understand that that is not material for the proposes of the amendment because they want to make a political point about the system more broadly. I understand that, and I do appreciate that some of those points have been made and the manner in which they have been made over the course of yesterday. I expect more courtesy today, but the government won't be supporting this amendment. I urge the Senate not to support it either.

           The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to a payment period that commences on or after the commencement of this item.

          <p>
           This amendment would raise the rate of income support to all income support recipients to $88 a day—to above the poverty line. I know the government is going to say, 'You're just making a political point.' This is not a political point. This is an attempt to improve the lives of millions of Australians who are living in poverty, who are starving, who are suffering from malnutrition, who are suffering from scurvy, who cannot afford to live in a home at the same time as putting food on the table or at the same time as paying their medical bills. We can afford this, and this parliament—this government—should be doing this. While they are not doing this, they are saying, 'We're going to go ahead with the stage 3 tax cuts and give the richest people in our country—the billionaires, the wealthy—$250 billion over the next 10 years.' That's the choice that's being made.
          </p>
          <p>
           Poverty is a political choice, and the Greens have decided that we will not stand for it any longer. We are going to take every opportunity we can to be advocating, to be pushing and to be working so hard for the people who are mired in poverty at the moment. We need to raise the rate of income support. We need to raise it above the poverty line. We need to raise it above $88 a day. And we need to do it now.

             and I thank you for the cheers. I welcome the fact that Senator Rice adopts the position that she advocates. There are many people in the community who live on the Newstart rate and find it very difficult to live on. The government has made it very clear that if we could raise the rate, we would, and that we will consider it in the light of every budget. The government is responsible for managing the fiscal circumstances of the budget. We've made it clear that we will consider it in the light of every budget, in terms of its circumstances as we come on, and we will not be supporting the amendment today.

                  Amendment (2) is framed as a request because it amends the bill to increase the income concession amount under the work bonus scheme. The income concession amount contributes to the amount that certain recipients of a social security pension, a service pension or income support supplement can earn before their payment begins to decrease. This means that increasing the income concession amount would result in recipients receiving a higher payment.

                  I outlined the coalition's rationale for these requests in the second reading debate, but I will quickly recap. There has been a lot said about our desire to improve the capacity for pensioners and other recipients of income support to contribute to the economy and receive income without it penalising them. Currently, under subsection 1073AA of the Social Security Act 1991, pensioners are limited to earning income concessions of up to 300 bucks over an instalment period of 14 days. The amendment request we're making here is in relation to doubling that amount to $600 and enabling those recipients of the pension payment to continue to receive that without the penalty that they would otherwise be exposed to.
                 </p>

                  Noting all of the benefits that flow from that, given the worker shortages we have across Australia, particularly in regional communities, a couple of points have been made by organisations like the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Chamber_of_Commerce_and_Industry" rel="nofollow">
                   Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
                  </a>
                  . They said in their prebudget submission of last December:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  There is an army of older workers with the skills Australia needs who would still like to work, but don't participate in the workforce as it reduces their pension.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The same organisation, in its submission to the Senate inquiry on the bill we are debating now, stated:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  Considering the deeply rooted labour market conditions, faltering productivity rates, and downgrades to domestic and international economic growth forecasts, these amendments will end long before the challenges facing businesses and the economy are solved.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That relates to the provisions the government have contained in their legislation without the further changes that the coalition is proposing now.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On that basis, I would commend the proposals before the chair to senators and seek their support.

                   I'm grateful to the opposition for dealing with them cognately, but they don't really stack up singly or together. They aren't affordable. They won't incentivise older Australians to take up work in the immediate term where the workplace shortages they claim to be concerned about are. After a decade of mismanagement in this area, with a trillion dollars in debt and very little to show for it, these guys want to double the incentive. That is not a serious proposition. It's not supported by anybody serious out there in industry. We can't sustain it as we go about a focused approach on sustainable budget repair.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The former government used social services as a political football and had a new minister in social services about every 12 months. They didn't take social services seriously, either. The idea that the new opposition can claim to have an interest in labour shortages, after a decade of policy failure in this area—of falling productivity, falling wages, falling capital expenditure and the remarkable achievement of an enormous reduction in temporary labour—and the idea that they'd come here today proposing to double the incentive, are pretty extraordinary. The government urges the Senate to oppose the amendments.

                    won't be supporting these amendments. We negotiated with the government to get an amendment in the House to extend the time period of this scheme until December next year. We think that that's a good period of time to have this workplace bonus in place. We're happy with a date towards the end of next year, potentially, to see whether it should be continued. But at this stage we are not supportive of moving the amendments that would extend it now.
