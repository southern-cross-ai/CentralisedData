        , my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the government aware that each year 19 million women and girls will face serious injury or illness and that 70,000 women will die as a consequence of abortions performed by unskilled people or in unsanitary conditions? Is the minister aware that almost all of those who suffer and die will live in the poorest countries in the world? Does the Australian aid program aim to reduce these unsafe abortions and, if so, how?

         Thank you to Senator Allison for the question. The subject matter, of course, is extremely serious. However, I should say that the government does not fund abortion services through the aid program, for three reasons. Firstly, the government believes it is more effective to support family-planning initiatives and education to avoid the problem of unwanted pregnancies in the first place. Secondly, there are strong legal restrictions on abortions in most Pacific island countries and, of course, throughout many parts of Asia. Thirdly, the government in these circumstances cannot be sure that all terminations in the region are performed voluntarily. This is a key concern for government and for anyone concerned with the human rights of women so affected.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, Australian aid funds can be used to provide information on the risks associated with unsafe abortion procedures. AusAID is undertaking a limited review of the aid program’s family planning guidelines. The focus of the review is to streamline the procedures within the guidelines. In 2006-07 estimated funding for reproductive and sexual health related activities, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">

         -
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , is $116 million, which is 4.4 per cent of the total aid budget, excluding Iraq debt relief. So, in response to Senator Allison, the government is undertaking this review with the kinds of matters to which she alludes in mind, against the background of the government’s policy position and the real difficulties that are in the face of the kind of action that she implies should be taken.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer and I ask whether this limited review may include possible change in the case of countries where abortion is not illegal. Can the minister provide the Senate with evidence that in some countries these terminations are involuntary?

           In response to Senator Allison’s supplementary question, I think it is appropriate to wait for the review. It will then be obvious as to the basis upon which the government might take some action in relation to some of the practices that have been the subject of the substantive question. I would have thought that Senator Allison would have been well aware of the allegations that abortions are involuntary in some countries. I do not know whether Senator Allison was on a committee I was on a few years ago—certainly Senator Bartlett was on it—where that was the very subject of a particular inquiry. These matters are serious. They are matters of concern to the government, and the review will address those concerns.
