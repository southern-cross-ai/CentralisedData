         Here we have a government yet again seeking to rearrange the procedures in this place. This is a dysfunctional government, a government that is now seeking to exempt legislation from the normal cut-off. It is doing that because it has not been able to get its house in order. No doubt Labor will once again move the gag in relation to this because they do not want to have explained to the Australian people how dysfunctional they are. This is a government that is self-focused. It is internally focused. All it talks about is whether our Prime Minister should or should not be ringing the boy in Bali. Why on earth would the Prime Minister be doing that? There is only one reason: to try to gazump the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Rudd, who has been making some headway, I understand, in relation to the Labor Party leadership stakes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is seeking to stop debate on all sorts of issues today. Why? Because it wants deceit, not debate. Let's make no bones about this. The Labor Party went to the last election promising no carbon tax, and today through the lower house they have forced it. Every single one of those Labor members, including the Prime Minister, was elected on a promise of no carbon tax. When I say that they are Labor members, they are only Labor members in name, because they have deceived and betrayed the Australian people and those that they used to champion. Before the election they promised those people that there would be no carbon tax.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note there is a Labor representative in this place, from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Democratic Labor Party
         </a>
         , who opposes the carbon tax, who supports manufacturing jobs and who is conscious of the cost-of-living pressures that people face. He has voted and undoubtedly will vote accordingly. But here we have a request seeking to exempt four bills from the cut-off. The minister just got up and moved it and thinks he can do so without explaining to this place why it is necessary, why they could not have brought in the legislation earlier so they did not need the cut-off. He is treating this place with the sort of contempt that we have now got used to under this Labor-Green alliance, a Labor-Green alliance that is betraying the trust of the Australian people.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let's never forget that the privilege we have to serve in this place, especially in a democracy such as ours, is based on a lot of convention, a lot of tradition and, most importantly, a lot of trust. When that trust goes, you start shaking the very foundations of the democratic process. That is why it is so important that the Australian people have confidence in the people they elect to keep their election promises. That is why the Australian people are so disgusted with the current government. Indeed, they have a right to be disgusted with what occurred in this place earlier today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let's not forget that five out of the six senators elected from each state at the last election were elected on a promise of no carbon tax, two out of the two senators elected from each of the territories were elected on a promise of no carbon tax, and 148 of the 150 members of the House of Representatives were also elected on a promise of no carbon tax. So the Australian people have a right to ask: 'What on earth has happened to the mandate that we gave to the people we elected? They promised us no carbon tax. How is it that, with 148 out of 150 members of the House of Representatives being elected on this promise, it passed the House of Representatives?'
        </p>
        <p>
         How come? Because they have betrayed the people that elected them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ms Gillard made that promise of no carbon tax for one very simple reason: she knew that if she had said the opposite, that there would be a carbon tax, she would not have been re-elected as Prime Minister. She knows that. We all know that. She holds the prime ministership in a very tenuous set of circumstances and she has betrayed the Australian people—there is no doubt about that—as has every single Labor member, as has every single
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         senator in this place who is now conniving to ensure that this deceit that has been perpetrated on the Australian people might actually come into law.
        </p>
        <p>
         This motion seeks to exempt four bills from the cut-off. They deal with matters as diverse as business names registration and the national vocational education and training regulator—all good issues and ones that in general we as a coalition would support. We will be supporting the passage of this exemption from the cut-off. Why? Because we are willing to assist this government when they are unable to run their own agenda. But when they commit a deceit on the Australian people, as they have done with the carbon tax, we will not be a party to it. We will oppose and seek to oppose on every possible occasion the implementation of this carbon tax, which the Australian people were solemnly promised they would not have.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do not know how the Labor Party members and senators look themselves in the mirror of a morning and say, 'Yes, I am really and truly representing the wishes of my electorate.' Indeed, I ask the same question about the two country Independents. I would have thought, if there was one thing that the Independents ought to be doing, it would be representing the wishes of their electorate without fear or favour. They go to the electorate saying, 'We can do this because we are not tied down by a party.' Also, an Independent surely should keep the government honest and keep it to its promises. The members for Lyne and New England have spectacularly failed on both counts in their role as Independents. They have betrayed the trust of the people that elected them. I fear that they know that and that is why they are going to keep this hapless, hopeless government on life support for as long as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         In doing so they may well get another year or so of parliamentary entitlements, but they will be doing untold continuing damage to the Australian nation and our economic fabric, especially if the carbon tax were to come into play, a carbon tax which will be destructive and corrosive in relation to the cost of living, where all Australians are battling. It will be destructive and corrosive in relation to jobs and job security. We know it will do nothing for the environment because day after day we ask this hapless, hopeless government at question time, 'What difference will it make to the environment?' No answer. We ask about the impact on jobs and they pretend there will be jobs growth. They pretend there will be economic growth because of it and that it is all good. The only problem I have is that, if it is all so good, why did they say 'no carbon tax' before the last election? What has happened in the last 12 months?
        </p>
        <p>
         As I am on my feet I fear that the hapless Clerk, who undoubtedly does a wonderful job but has been given the task of presenting these bills to the Senate, has arrived at the Senate door—a very sad day, a very sad moment. I am sorry to pick on the Clerk. I do not do so in a personal manner. All the clerks in both houses do a fantastic job and act according to the will expressed in votes by either house. But this Clerk has the task of presenting these bills that are a deceit on the Australian people. They are bills that should never have seen the light of day because we were promised no carbon tax. They should never have got through the House of Representatives because the members who were elected down there, 148 of them, all promised no carbon tax. They rolled over, I fear at the behest of Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
          Bob Brown
         </a>
         and the Greens. It is a tragic day for Australia that this has happened and now these bills have been, as I speak, transmitted up here, which is also a very sad occasion. We will have a debate on those bills, but they are a betrayal of the Australian people and the trust that they placed in their elected representatives.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said earlier, the government have trouble with their timetable. The government are struggling in relation to the cut-off for certain legislation. Why? Because they cannot get their house in order; they cannot run the show as a mature and proper government should be able to run the show. We will assist them in allowing the cut-off to be exempted in relation to legislation which we in general terms support. Nevertheless, we say to the government: if you want an exemption on a matter, do the courteous and decent thing. Explain to the chamber why it is necessary and important. Do not just rely on the Labor-Greens alliance to shunt everything through this Senate without even explaining anything. Do not rely on them to continually guillotine legislation. You might be able to win the votes in this place, but one thing you are not doing is winning the hearts and minds of our fellow Australians in relation to this important matter of the carbon tax. I will conclude my remarks by saying we will always cooperate to make sure that this place works as efficiently as possible, but we will never be party to the sort of deceit that Labor and the Greens are seeking to perpetrate with the carbon tax.

          I wish to contribute to the series of debates this morning and to this one in particular on exempting the Business Names Registration Bill 2011 and related bills from the cut-off. As our leader in the Senate, Senator Abetz, has said, we will be supporting that. It is a bill that is relatively straightforward and can run the passage of debate in this place without the normal cut-off procedures. It is so different to the cut-off for the other bills that have been debated this morning.
         </p>
         <p>
          I call upon members of the Greens political party to explain why all of Senator
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
           Bob Brown
          </a>
          's very pious and very principled speeches over the whole of his parliamentary career against guillotining debate and gagging individual senators has suddenly changed. Why is it that Senator Brown—who, for as long as he has been in this chamber, has got up and wasted the time of the Senate by calling votes on motions that he knows have no chance of passing—has spent hours in this Senate railing against the guillotine? Why has he spent literally hours in this Senate arguing against the gagging of individual senators wishing to speak on any bill? But on a bill as important as the carbon tax legislation—which will change the way of life for all Australians; which will add to their cost of living; and which makes things, particularly for those of us who live in rural and regional and remote Australia, even more expensive—why has he now abandoned his former principled opposition to guillotines and gags and gone along with his mates in the Labor Party?
         </p>
         <p>
          I think that Senator Brown's supporters—those many people who I think are misguided, but there you are, they are there—have always thought Senator Brown was worth a vote because he believed in parliamentary democracy. He believed that every person had the right to have their say. He believed that this chamber and this parliament was a place where the views of Australians could be put without restriction. But what has happened today? So far this morning, Senator Brown has led his little band of senators in guillotining debate on no less than three occasions in a couple of hours. Some of Senator Brown's supporters may well say: 'That's not why we voted for you. We voted for you because you've always portrayed yourself as the upholder of parliamentary democracy.' Those of us who sit in the chamber know that is completely wrong. But Senator Brown has been able to hoodwink many people who have voted for him over many years into believing that he does believe in parliamentary democracy and that he does believe that matters should be fully debated.
         </p>
         <p>
          Before the last election the Prime Minister put her hand and on her heart and said solemnly to the Australian people on two occasions at least, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' How can you trust anything that this Prime Minister might ever say today, tomorrow or at any time in the future, when she has clearly, as result of the vote today in the other place, abandoned that solemn promise?
         </p>
         <p>
          Some would say the Prime Minister is a liar. I would not say that because I know it is unparliamentary. But what I would say is that this is a policy and this is a principle based on a lie. If the Prime Minister thinks that it is genuine, she should do the honourable thing—although we understand she is incapable of honourable things as a result of this debate—and go back to the people of Australia and say: 'I did promise you this. I have now changed my mind because I wanted to stay Prime Minister and the only way I could do that was if I got the Greens on side, and they wanted me to do this. So I've changed my mind. But as a democrat, I will put back to the Australian people my change of mind. I promised you 12 months ago there would be no carbon tax but now I want a carbon tax, so I am going to ask the Australian if they support that.'
         </p>
         <p>
          You would not have to be Einstein to understand that the Australian people do not want a carbon tax. You do not always believe opinion polls but they cannot be that wrong. More than 50 per cent of the Australian people clearly oppose the carbon tax. In fact, at the last federal election there were 150 candidates in the House of Representatives. They all stood for election. They confronted their electors and said: 'We want you to vote for us. These are the policies we stand upon.' What was the policy that 148 members of the lower house supported? It was that there would be no carbon tax, and please vote for them. So all the people in those 148 electorates around Australia said, 'I can vote for Mr Perrett because he is not going to support a carbon tax; I can vote for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Livermore" rel="nofollow">
           Kirsten Livermore
          </a>
          in the electorate of Capricornia in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           Central Queensland
          </a>
          because she is going to vote against a carbon tax.' Kirsten Livermore, the member for Capricornia, actually said before the election, as did her leader, 'There will be no carbon tax.' The electorate of Capricornia in Central Queensland incorporates Rockhampton and mining towns such as Moranbah, Dysart and Middlemount—towns that produce Australia's wealth, that supply employment to the people of Central Queensland. The industry in those towns gives people who live in the area good wages, allowing them to build new homes down at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_Park" rel="nofollow">
           Emu Park
          </a>
          on the Yeppoon-
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_Coast" rel="nofollow">
           Capricorn Coast
          </a>
          . All those people said: 'We can vote for Kirsten Livermore because she is going to oppose the carbon tax. We do not want the carbon tax because we know what it will do to our jobs, we know what it will do to our pay packets and we know what it will do to the mortgage that we have to pay on the new home that we have just built down at Emu Park.' So they voted for Kirsten Livermore, confident in the fact that there would be no carbon tax in this term of parliament. What has happened today? Kirsten Livermore and the very principled Mr Perrett have breached that promise to their electorate and voted for a carbon tax that they promised we would not have.
         </p>
         <p>
          How can you believe anything Prime Minister Gillard would ever say? How can you believe anything anyone in the Labor Party would ever say? I challenge Senator Furner, Senator Ludwig, Senator McLucas and Senator Moore—the senators from Queensland elected at the previous election—to explain to the people of Queensland why they promised just a year ago that, if elected, they would not introduce a carbon tax. I ask them to come into this chamber and tell the Senate why they went to the last election and promised there would be no carbon tax, and today they are part of a party that has voted for it in the House—and I am sure that in a few weeks they will be part of a party that will vote for the carbon tax in the Senate. They themselves will vote for it.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like Senator McLucas, who sometimes comes from the north, where I come from, to get up and explain to the people of Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Moranbah, Dysart and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa" rel="nofollow">
           Mount Isa
          </a>
          why she went to the last election promising that she would not impose a carbon tax on them. I want her to come into this chamber and explain now why she has gypped those people, why she has completely broken her promise and done something quite contrary to what she promised she would do. It is important that Senator McLucas does that, because she knows that this carbon tax will add even more to the cost of living of people in those towns that I have just mentioned because we are all going to pay more for fuel. When you pay more for fuel you pay more for transport. You do not have to be Einstein to work out that the further you live from the capital cities and the further you live from the major ports, the higher the transport costs. Costs in the electorate that Senator McLucas claims to represent in the north are going to increase quite substantially.
         </p>
         <p>
          A lot of people still think air conditioning is a luxury. In the north where I come from—along with Senator McLucas, Mr Snowdon and Senator Crossin—air conditioning is no longer a luxury. It is an essential part of life. But the cost of air conditioning will become prohibitive. Many pensioners will have to turn off their air conditioners and try and live through the heat of a northern summer without that support because they will simply not be able to afford the electricity bills that will increase substantially as a result of this carbon tax being imposed by a Labor Party that promised it would never be imposed. This is a very serious matter. People will die without air conditioning. I can guarantee you that there will be pensioners and people on limited incomes in the north who will not be able to afford to turn on their air conditioners once this carbon tax comes into place. I want Senator McLucas and Senator Crossin to come into this chamber and explain to me why they are putting these people at that risk.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of all the senators that the Labor-Greens government comprises at the moment, Senator Waters, who I see has just come into the chamber, is the only one that can hold her head up high. I concede that Senator Waters did at least have the honesty and courage to go to the last election and say, 'Elect me and I will vote for a carbon tax,' because that has been the Greens policy, wrong though it is. At least she was honest about it. But the other people that the Labor-Green government comprises at the moment are completely dishonest because they have abrogated their duties and their honour to their electorates.
         </p>
         <p>
          As senators will know, there are not many Labor members from Queensland in the lower house. There are not that many Labor senators from Queensland either. The people of Queensland have long since worked out that Labor cannot manage money. They cannot be trusted. What further evidence do they ever need than what has happened in the lower house today? To those few Queensland Labor members who are left, I say to them: guys, your days are numbered. You had the opportunity today to stand by your promise. You had the opportunity today to stand by the people of Queensland, the people who elected you to this parliament.
         </p>
         <p>
          The people of Queensland—and I can talk about Queensland; I am a senator for Queensland—clearly do not want a carbon tax. Mr Swan, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, promised everyone before the last election that there would be no carbon tax. In fact, when
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
           Tony Abbott
          </a>
          , the Leader of the Liberal Party, said, 'Elect Labor and you will get a carbon tax,' Mr Swan said of Mr Abbott: 'He is being hysterical. There will be no carbon tax. Our leader has said it. I as deputy leader say it. There will be no carbon tax under a future Labor government.' This is Mr

          . He has already lost his seat of Lilley once because of his arrogance—the way he treated his electorate with disdain, the way he completely ignored their wishes and spent his time floating around Australia doing whatever Labor members of parliament do. He did not look after his electorate of Lilley, and they voted him out. I can assure Mr Swan that at an election this year, next year or the year after: brother, you will not be there. It happened once before that his arrogance was understood by his electorate, and they got rid of him. This time they will not forget. I can guarantee that.
         </p>
         <p>
          And that goes for the other Queensland Labor members of parliament. I cannot remember them all, although it is not hard since there are so few in Queensland: Mr Emerson and Ms Livermore—and Mr Perrett, whom we cannot forget. I think that is about it. None of the others reach the radar screen. None of them will be there. In fact, opinion polls conducted by the
          <i>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_Mail" rel="nofollow">
            Courier Mail
           </a>
          </i>
          showed that an election held anywhere in the near future would result in only one member of the Labor Party being elected in Queensland. That would be Mr Rudd, the past and future leader. A lot of the Labor Party backbenchers are now looking at their own futures, looking at their own pension entitlements, looking at the avalanche of voter anger coming their way. They are thinking that Mr Rudd, although they got rid of him a year or so ago, is not looking so bad after all.
         </p>
         <p>
          So I predict that Mr Rudd will be back as Labor leader. But do not take any notice of my prediction. Some of the Labor members also predict that Mr Rudd will be back as leader. And those who protest the most loudly against that are most likely the ones who will be supporting him. That is fortunate, because at least there would be a Queensland Labor member in parliament. On recent opinions polls, Mr Rudd is the only Queensland Labor member who would be left in parliament. And something like that has happened before.

Senator Collins may take a point of order on that, but they are all accurate descriptions of a leader who went to the last election and promised solemnly that under no circumstances would there be a carbon tax under the government she led.

                Here we are today seeing the disgrace of all of those Labor members who were voted for by their constituents on the policy of no carbon tax now voting for a carbon tax. They will get their retribution, and they know it. Mr Perrett, with his marvellous, selfless indication that if Labor changed their leader then he would resign from the parliament, can read the figures as well as I can. He is on a one per cent margin, and nothing will save Mr Perrett from his dishonesty in promising his electorate that he would not vote for a carbon tax.

A year ago Ms Livermore promised the people of Rockhampton, Moranbah, Dysart and Middlemount that she would not vote for a carbon tax—a tax that will impact very, very heavily on the jobs, mortgages and future lifestyles of her constituents. She told those constituents that there would be no carbon tax, yet today she has breached that promise, that obligation—that duty, almost—to the people who elected her, and she has voted for a carbon tax. I can only wait for the next election, whenever it is held—next week, next month, next year or in two years time. The people of Capricornia will take their revenge.

                 As has been indicated by the leader, the coalition will support this issue of exemption for these bills. But I make the point that there is a reason for the government to ask for an exemption for bills. It is usually a timely sort of issue but, yet again, the facilitation by the coalition in this particular instance highlights the mismanagement, as the leader said earlier, by this 'hopeless, hapless government'. If they actually had an ability to properly run their affairs in the chamber and to properly run the government then they would not need to be bringing these bills to the chamber to make this request. Is that not reflected in their absolute inability not only to manage their chamber affairs properly but to manage their policies properly and to manage the economy properly? They have an absolute inability to manage anything properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In this instance we will be supporting the exemption for these particular bills. But I do question the processes the government has brought to this chamber this morning. Earlier this morning we saw debate on an earlier motion on a controversial exemption for the Clean Energy Bill. And what did we see? We saw Senator Fifield's excellent contribution, reflecting very strongly the position of the coalition with regard to this. And what did Senator Ludwig do? What did the Manager of Government Business do? He gagged debate after only one contribution—excellent though it might have been—from this side of the chamber, with no opportunity, I might add, for the Leader of the Nationals to have a contribution or for the Independents to have a contribution. Bang! He shut it down—'Controversial; don't listen to any debate.' What do we have here? Another similar motion for exemption. Debate is ensuing. There is no commentary from the other side of the chamber; in fact, everybody on the other side of the chamber has disappeared. This is exactly the same process as applied to the earlier bill. But no—everybody has disappeared now. They are quite happy for debate to run on this. It makes absolutely no sense and shows yet again this government's complete inability to properly manage chamber affairs and affairs of the government.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I return to my earlier point: with the requests for exemption, there is usually a reason. There are obviously some good reasons for these particular bills we are discussing at the moment. With the previous bills, though—colleagues, you might well be as perplexed as I am—what is the urgency? We had Senator Evans in here earlier waxing something—I would not say 'lyrical', because it was not quite lyrical; he was waxing, anyway, in quite a loud voice—and saying that the timetable has been set out for these bills coming in, that the coalition should have known about that and that it was appalling that we wanted to contribute to the debate at that point. But at no point did Minister Evans give us any reason for the urgency for the cut-off—not one.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is interesting to note that the clean energy legislation is not due to kick off until 1 July 2012. So why are we here on 12 October 2011 being told by the government that this is a matter of urgency? It simply makes absolutely no sense—unless, of course, we look a little further. I shall refer to the excellent interim report from the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 on Scrutiny of New Taxes, and I again commend Senator Cormann for the work he has done on this. I will just read this for the chamber, because I think it may well relate to the request for exemption for the earlier clean energy bills:

                  South Africa
                 </a>
                 , in December. I wonder if perhaps that is not the driving factor for the request by the government today for the exemption, because nothing else makes any sense. If this legislation is not coming in till 1 July next year, what is the imperative? What is the biting imperative that we should be doing the bills in the next few weeks? That is the only reason I can see—which, of course, the government has not raised and never would and is trying to keep very quiet. Of course, there are the Greens, as you said earlier, Senator Macdonald; I will refer to your conclusion. Perhaps the Greens may have driven the government to change its mind on this. Isn't it a sad day when we have the Greens, who have 10 members of parliament out of 226, telling the government what to do? That is not democracy in any way, shape or form.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So what we have is a request for exemption for the clean energy bills so that the government and others can go to South Africa and strut their stuff on a stage—'We've got our clean energy bills through the parliament in Australia.' Do you know what this is, colleagues, from the Prime Minister? This is nothing but vanity legislation. This is vanity legislation because she wants the ability to strut her stuff on the world stage, saying, 'Look what I've achieved.' The only thing is that she has achieved absolutely nothing except creating a huge burden for the Australian people—a huge financial tax and an impost that the Australian people are going to have to carry but that is not going to change the climate one little bit. So that is the reason for all this rush. That is the reason that we have to get these bills through so terribly, terribly quickly, and that is so wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Colleagues, you might remember that recently Senator Penny Wong was asked why we were actually moving to a carbon tax and why we had to have a carbon tax. Let me just remind you that the minister's reply was: 'Because the Australian people are not shirkers.' That is apparently the bones for this important legislation. That is apparently why we have to have a carbon tax: because the Australian people are not shirkers. We in this country apparently have to lead the rest of the world even though it is not going to make the slightest bit of difference to the climate—even though the carbon tax is not going to do anything to change the climate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We have on occasion had bad legislation come through this chamber—there is no doubt about that—but usually, if it is bad legislation, at least there is an intended reason and an intended outcome from that legislation. The intended outcome from the carbon tax legislation, to change the climate, simply will not be effected by this piece of legislation, and that is what is so wrong, and that is what the Australian people understand. They understand that they are going to get hit with a massive new tax that is not going to change the climate one little bit, and that is why they are so against it. Australia emits 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions and, in spite of any protestations from the other side, you only have to look at the work from the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                  Productivity Commission
                 </a>
                 to know that no other country is doing what we are about to do with this carbon tax. That is not me; that is coming from the Productivity Commission. That is not
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fiona_Nash" rel="nofollow">
                  Senator Fiona Nash
                 </a>
                 ; that is the Productivity Commission.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So why are we doing it? It is hard to understand why we are doing this. I can only go back to Senator Macdonald's very perspicacious comments, I believe, that the Greens have pushed the government into doing this, because something must have happened. Before the last election the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Other colleagues have said this and we will continue to say this: you cannot get any clearer than what the Prime Minister said. You cannot get any more straightforward than a statement like that. But what do we have now? We have a government that is foisting a carbon tax on the Australian people that they do not want. If the government were honest with itself, it would know that the Australian people do not want a carbon tax. Last time I looked this was a democracy. Last time I looked, you could have your say in this country and you could have your views and your voice heard. On this particular issue, this Prime Minister has taken away from the ability of the Australian people to have a say.
                </p>
                <p>
                 At the last election, the Australian people believed the Prime Minister when she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' They believed her. Why wouldn't they? In this country, we are brought up to respect office and expect honesty from those holding high office. But what did we get? We got a lie. No matter which way you look at it, no matter which way you turn it, for the Prime Minister to have said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and then to give the Australian people a carbon tax under the government she leads—it is a lie. The Australian people are quite rightly looking at this government and saying, 'What did we vote for?' When we look at what this government have done, we are well on our way to an absolute dark day.

                 ? It was extraordinary. I have listened for a number of years to Senator Bob Brown and others in the Greens chastising the chamber for the use of the guillotine and how dreadful it was—I keep going back to Senator Macdonald's excellent contribution. It is interesting to note that several years ago in relation to Work Choices Bob Brown said:

Reduce them to the minimum'—and we are reduced to the minimum—'but extend the length of the sitting'—so we sat last night rather than having another week's sitting—'and then guillotine any debate that gets long so that we can get out of here and not have the government under scrutiny.'

                     Yes, it is absolutely gutless. This morning Senator Siewert ran through all the instances where a guillotine has occurred before. How about this? If Senator Siewert is so concerned about the instances of the guillotine before, why didn't she direct her anger at the Labor government side of this chamber and not the coalition? Why have a go at us about it? Why not have a go at the other side of the chamber and the Labor government? They are the ones who pulled out the guillotine. We can see it from their track record—their opposition to the guillotine is there in thousands and thousands of words in

                     so why didn't Senator Siewert and Senator Brown oppose the Labor government this morning when they called on the guillotine? I do not think you have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out. I do not think you even have to be a kindergartener to figure this out.

                     As much as the Greens have been misguided, in my view, over the years—and I agree with precious little of their policies and with what they say—at least they had a little bit of principle back then. At least they said what they believed in. But now they have lost every bit of integrity and principle regarding this issue, because today they directed their remarks to the wrong side of the chamber.

                       Yes, and a smirk. The Australian people will understand exactly the hypocrisy of the Greens on this issue. This government told us there was not going to be a carbon tax. When we say 'No' to government, when we point out all the things that are wrong with the carbon tax, when we point out the incredibly bad effect this will have on the Australian people—the cost to the hip-pocket; the cost of electricity, transport and fuel going through the roof; and all those things, most of which will hit regional Australian harder than anywhere else—those on the other side of the chamber love saying that we are scaremongering. That is their distraction to stop us having the Australian people know the truth.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Prior to the last election the Prime Minister told the Australian people, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' I also want to refer to what the Treasurer,

                        Wayne Swan
                       </a>
                       , said when he was asked, 'Can you tell us exactly when Labor will apply a price to carbon?' For the chamber, it was 15 August 2010 when he said:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       Well, certainly what we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax from the Liberals in their advertising. We certainly reject that. What we've said is that we will go back and seek to reconstruct a community consensus about how we deal with climate change.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Unbelievable! There is another lie, because it was not a hysterical allegation. The coalition was right on the money before the last election, saying that this government would bring in a carbon tax. The Treasurer rejected it—here, in black and white. Have we seen any community consensus? None. We have seen one inquiry—six days for submissions and 1,100 pages that no-one could get through. What sort of community consensus is that? It is absolutely appalling. At this point people do not know whether to be furiously angry or incredibly sad that this government is bringing such an appalling piece of legislation before this chamber. It has already gone through the other place and it is a very, very sad day indeed.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       We look at Mr Perrett sticking up for his principles because he could not possibly stay there if the Labor Party changed its leader. He could have stuck up for his principles and said: 'Before the last election we said to you that there wasn't going to be a carbon tax. Now there is going to be a carbon tax so I am going to cross the floor and stick up for my principles and vote against a carbon tax.' Then he would have been a true representative, as so many of the other Labor members and senators would have been true representatives. In their hearts, so many of them know that this carbon tax should not be coming forward. They know that and yet they are so bound by the Labor machine that they cannot truly reflect what their electorates want. They cannot truly do what their electorates are asking them to do. I can tell you and anybody listening that you do not have to be a rocket scientist. A kindergarten child could walk down the street, talk to businesses, people in the shops, teachers, policemen, workers in the abattoirs, people in regional communities and people in the cities, and overwhelmingly understand that Australians do not want a carbon tax.

                       , the Australian people went berserk. They did not want an ETS. They are going to get one in three short years. This was done under cloak and dagger because the Prime Minister promised the Australian people that they would not have a carbon tax. They are now getting one. We will keep fighting it and I promise the Australian people we will get rid of it.

That was a kiss of success based on a lie. It was a kiss of success based on deceit and a complete, utter fabrication given to the Australian people before the last election.

                        It has been said today, and I will say it again for the benefit of those in the gallery: six days out from the election, the Prime Minister promised the Australian people that there would not be a carbon tax under a government led by her.

                        I put on the record again a couple of comments from senior Labor Party ministers to put some context to this debate today, and in the other place, and to the debate which will occur in this chamber while we debate the carbon tax bills. I will read three quotes and I ask those on the other side to reflect on those quotes. It is not just the Prime Minister's quote that there will be no carbon tax under a government she leads.

                          A failed climate change minister. Out of the mouths of babes come these comments on the carbon tax. We know that the Prime Minister promised before the last election there would be no carbon tax. We know that 72 lower house members were elected on the back of a lie, including the Labor Party members in Corangamite, Corio, Bendigo and Ballarat—they were all re-elected on a lie. So how is it that we have got to the position where we are debating a carbon tax some 12 months later? We know what the reason is, and the reason is that a desperate Prime Minister, elected on the back of a lie, did a dirty, grubby deal with the

                         <p>
                          I say to my colleagues opposite—I am not going to name names but you know who you are—that you know it is a grubby deal and you know you do not support one single thing that the Australian Greens stand for. Are you, over the next month, eventually going to side with a party that you do not support and a party with whom the Prime Minister did this grubby deal? Are you going to join your colleagues in the other place by being part of this web of deceit? I suspect that you are not going to have the guts to do what you know you should be doing, and I think you will carve your names in this dirty piece of history and will support this carbon tax. You will vote against what you know is the right thing to do and vote for this grubby, grubby deal between the current Prime Minister and the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Brown.

                          I hope that those on the other side will view this morning's footage from the House of Representatives. It was quite sickening. When you celebrate a lie with a celebratory kiss, what does it say about what drives the current government? I think it says that we have a Prime Minister whom every single person in this chamber and the other place knows is under incredible pressure to hold a job, and we know that the former Prime Minister,
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">

                          </a>
                          , is on a mission to destroy the person who he believes destroyed him. So the Australian people are going to get lumbered with a carbon tax, ahead of the rest of the world—a carbon tax that the Prime Minister promised she would not introduce, that Minister Wong said would not work—to save the Prime Minister's job. Is that what politics has got to in this country—that we have a Prime Minister who will desperately sell out herself and her party to keep her job? Is that the stage we have got to? I notice Senator Cormann is in the chamber today. I encourage people to read the report he tabled last Friday and see what damage a carbon tax will do to this country. I encourage people to make a judgement about a government that would do that to its own people, and I encourage them to look at the sort of price impacts we are going to see as a result of this toxic carbon tax.

                          I am a resident of regional Australia, and every person representing regional and rural areas in this place knows full well that the impact of prices on electricity and other energy bills falls heavier outside the metropolitan areas of Australia—in my own state, there is a difference of some 30 per cent. So here we have a country that is on the precipice, along with the rest of the world, of a double-dip recession. Not one person on either side of this chamber wants us to return to recession. But it is a real risk—and that is not

                          and from other organisations. We are on the cusp. So what does this government do to protect the country from that? It puts in a carbon tax that is going to export not only emissions but also Australians' dollars.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          If ever we needed a government in this country that was prepared to stand up for its people, it is now. Now is the time for this Prime Minister to stand up for the people who elected her. Now is the time for the Prime Minister to stand up for those people who did not vote for her. Now is the time for some national leadership in extraordinarily difficult international times. What are we left with? We are left with the remnants of a grubby, get me re-elected deal. That is what it has come down to. When we need leadership, we get a lack of leadership. When we need a Prime Minister to stand up for us, we get a Prime Minister who is only interested in one job, and that is her own. The Prime Minister does not care about the jobs of working men and women in this country. The 72 Labor Party members in the other place who voted for this toxic tax do not care about those people. Those opposite have the opportunity in this chamber over the next month to say to the Australian people, 'We think your job is more important than the Prime Minister's job.' Let us see whether those on the other side have the intestinal fortitude to do that. I think I have a rough idea of what the answer is.

                            I think they are going to wimp out, as Senator Williams said. They will wimp out when the time comes. It must have absolutely galled the senator to sit there and watch Senator Brown with that smirk on his face this morning. What motivates those people on the other side? What drives them in a situation like this? Have they not got the guts to stand up for this country and for the working men and women who deserve no less than a government who is not prepared to wash them away in the interests of one person's job?
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I have some options for them, and I think these are probably options that they have thought about. Why not do the right thing and let the next election be an effective plebiscite on this toxic tax? Why not call an election? They can do what they like with their leader—we are not remotely interested in what is driving the

                            </a>
                            . The Australian people are not remotely interested in the petty little leadership disputes of those opposite. They are not interested; they do not care. What they do care about is being lied to. What they do care about is a toxic tax that will potentially destroy their jobs. That is what they want to know about.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            If the government thinks this tax is so good, why not call an election now? Why not make it a plebiscite on the carbon tax? Then we will have the decision and we can put their petty little leadership disputes behind us and get on with running this country properly. Why not take up the challenge and go to the polls? Why not do it? I think I know the answer. I suspect there are plenty on the other side in the other place who will not be here in that case. I suspect if the government keep on pursuing what they are doing then in the separate half-Senate election a few senators will be going as well. The government should go to the polls and let the Australian people make a decision about this. They can justify it because they were elected on the back of a lie. It is easy to go back and get some clarification from the Australian people about whether this government would have been elected had the people been given the opportunity to cast their vote on a carbon tax.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            If they are not prepared to do that I will give them another suggestion. Why not see out the term, get on with the job of running this country, sort out their leadership dispute and tell the Australian people that they will delay implementation of this toxic tax until after the election, making it a plebiscite in two years time. They should do one or the other but they should not impose on the Australian community a tax that they know is well ahead of the rest of the world. They should not impose on this community a toxic carbon tax that is going to risk our economic recovery and potentially put us to the back of the pack again. They should just do the right thing and stop concentrating on themselves. They need to stop this self-indulgent claptrap in relation to who wants the Prime Minister's job. Forget about that. It has been destabilising this government for the last six months. It has put the government in complete and utter policy paralysis. It is driving them to introduce a potentially job-destroying, economy-destroying, toxic carbon tax. They should just do the right thing and go to the polls. They need to let us have a decision on the community's views about this carbon tax.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I do not think there is one person on this side of the chamber who would not say that we would respect the outcome of the community's views in relation to this matter, but we have no respect for a government who imposed a tax of on the back of a lie and who did not give the Australian community the opportunity to vote on this particular matter. They must do the right thing and go to the polls, and then we will see whether this tax is or is not supported by the community. If it is, we will get on with it. If it is not—which is my strong suspicion and, I suspect, the strong suspicion of those 72 members and those on the other side of the chamber—then let us drop it.

                             This Gillard Labor government is a government which has lost the confidence of the Australian people. In her government's dying days, as the Prime Minister holds onto power by the tips of her fingernails, she is trying to ram as much bad legislation through this parliament as she possibly can. This Prime Minister wants to inflict as much damage on the Australian economy as she possibly can by putting through bad policy and bad legislation, and by taking advantage of the fact that her government, with the support of the Greens, has the numbers in this chamber.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Even though the government has complete control of this chamber, courtesy of the support of its alliance with the Greens, it still cannot manage the affairs of the chamber. There has been mismanagement after mismanagement. We well know that everything they touch in a policy sense they stuff up. But they cannot even manage the affairs of this chamber.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I will just remind the chamber what we are currently debating. We are debating a motion from Senator Ludwig asking for the exemption of the Business Names Registration Bill 2011 and a number of related bills and the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment Bill 2011 from the provisions of standing order 111(5) to (8) concerning the consideration of legislation. This is a rather uncontroversial matter. It is a matter which the opposition supports. Yet the government is quite relaxed about having an open-ended debate in the chamber about something that, in comparison to the carbon tax, is not actually that important.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Yesterday the government, supported by their trusted allies, the Greens, gagged the debate on the student tax. Today there was a motion in relation to the carbon tax, something that is going to have significant implications for the Australian economy, for families, for household budgets and for the federal budget and something that is going to have implications for many years beyond the bad government that currently is inflicting so much damage on the Australian nation. The government is quite happy to have a detailed debate about whether or not the Business Names Registration Bill 2011 and other bills should be exempt from a particular standing order of the Senate, but on issues in relation to the carbon tax—a tax which will push up the cost of everything, make Australia less competitive internationally, cost jobs, reduce real wages, shift emissions overseas instead of reducing them and make no difference to the environment or the climate at all—we are not allowed to have a debate, according to this dictatorial, arrogant, out-of-touch Gillard-Brown Labor-Green government.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Members on the government side of the chamber will stand condemned in history for the absolute contempt with which they have handled this issue. It has been well documented that this carbon tax is based on lie after lie after lie. We had the well-documented lie before the last election. The Prime Minister, facing defeat, knew that she needed to pull a rabbit out of the hat in order to hang onto government. The Prime Minister knew that, unless she gave an emphatic commitment that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, she would not be returned to government. As it happens, she was only just able to scrape in, by the fingernails of the member for Lyne and the member for New England.

                               Across both electorates, 10,000 surveys in relation to the carbon tax were returned. The question that was asked was whether people were in favour of or against the carbon tax. Nearly 90 per cent of people in those electorates who returned the survey were opposed to the carbon tax. I get distracted because I get upset—and I understand why my friends in the National Party get upset—when I see two members representing rural areas treating their electorates and the wishes of their electorates with such complete disregard, knowing that the carbon tax will have a particularly bad impact on regional Australia.

                              <p>
                               So here we are. We have a government which before the last election promised that there would be no carbon tax. Then, of course, in order to hold onto government the Prime Minister had to give in to the pressure and the cajoling of the Greens. She signed on the dotted line an alliance deal which sold out working families across Australia, which sold out people who will face increased costs of living while there will be fewer jobs and lower real wages.

                               When the obvious outcry across Australia came around, when people across Australia said, 'Hang on; that's not what we were promised,' what did the Prime Minister say? The Prime Minister, standing in her courtyard with 'Deputy Prime Minister' Senator
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
                                Bob Brown

                               standing by her side, said: 'Don't you worry. You might not like it now, but once we have put out the detail people will like it. People will like it once we've put out the information on compensation, on transitional assistance, on the money-go-round. People will like it.' You know what? The detail is out and people still do not like it. In fact, people like it less, because people understand that they are being asked to make a sacrifice which will make absolutely no difference to the environment.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               People across Australia are not fools. They understand that if you impose a cost on businesses in Australia by imposing a carbon price—a cost which is not faced by businesses in other parts of the world—if you make higher emitting businesses in other parts of the world more competitive than lower emitting businesses in Australia, if you just help higher emitting businesses in other parts of the world take market share away from even the most environmentally efficient equivalent businesses in Australia, then all you are doing is shifting emissions to other parts of the world, where the emissions for the same amount of economic output will actually be higher. So global emissions are actually going to go up.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               We know that the government's own modelling expects that emissions in Australia will continue to go up. We know that the government's own modelling expects that emissions in China will go up from about 10.3 million tonnes now to 17.9 million tonnes in 2020. Let me pause a moment here and reflect on that 17.9 million figure, because I thought: gee, that's rather high; that's a pretty significant increase—a 7.6 million-tonne
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
                                CO2
                               </a>
                               emissions increase out of China. That sounds more than what we were told only three years ago. And my suspicions were right, because when I checked the Treasury modelling in 2008, do you know what Treasury told us about Chinese emissions in 2008? They told us that CO2 emissions out of china in 2020 would be 16.1 million tonnes. So 16.1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions out of China in 2020 was what Treasury told us three years ago. Now they tell us it is going to be 17.9 million tonnes in 2020. That is an increase in the expected emissions out of China in 2020 of 1.8 million tonnes. The margin of error between the Treasury modelling in 2008 and the Treasury modelling in 2011 is more than three times the emissions across the whole of Australia in a whole year! And we think that to push up the cost of living and to reduce Australia's international competitiveness and put jobs at risk is actually going to do something to reduce global emissions. It won't.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               And of course the government knows this: the government knows that its policy does not hang together. The government knows that people across Australia understand that this is bad policy, the premise of which is of course based on a broken promise made five days before the last election. This is why the government wants to minimise the level of scrutiny of this legislation in this parliament.

                               And of course we had the sham, absolutely sham, joint select committee inquiry, which was chaired by a member of the government, deputy-chaired by another member of the government—in Greens Senator Christine Milne—and which gave one week for submissions, one week for hearings and one week to finalise the report! Senator Milne yesterday in this chamber was having a go at the Senate carbon tax inquiry, saying it was a coalition committee. Well, no, it was not a coalition committee, actually; it was and is a committee of the Senate. It is the Senate
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">

                               on the Scrutiny of New Taxes, which has on it three Liberal senators, one National Party senator, two Labor senators—and, of course, one of those Labor senators, consistent with convention, being the deputy chair of the committee. So there is an opposition chair, a government deputy chair and there have been previous Labor deputy chairs—the then Senator Hutchins; and for a week Senator Matt Thistlethwaite, until the factional powerbrokers told him that he had to resign to let Senator Cameron come in as deputy chair. But, be that as it may, consistent with convention there was an opposition chair and a government deputy chair, which of course is not what was done in the joint select committee sponsored by the government. Against any past convention, government committee members were both the chair and the deputy chair of that committee, with the member for Chisholm as the chair and Senator Milne as the deputy chair.

                               And of course our committee went through a very comprehensive process over a 12-month period, listening to evidence from a wide range of witnesses, travelling the length and breadth of Australia—instead of staying here, totally limited to the eastern-state-centric triangle of Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. But if you only have a week to hold hearings, you cannot make it all the way to

                               to listen to the views, the issue, the challenges and the aspirations of the people of Western Australia. It is way too hard to talk to people in Western Australia about the implication of the carbon tax on them—way too far to go.

                               But there happen to be some pretty specific issues for the great state of Western Australia when it comes to the carbon tax—because, as senators would well understand, the carbon tax creates some significant issues for the electricity generation industry. Out of the 500 so-called biggest polluters, as the Prime Minister describes them—where the Department of
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">

                               and Energy Efficiency has a more neutral description; it actually refers to them as the '500 biggest emitters', but in the Orwellian spin language that we have become accustomed to from this government, the government calls them the 500 biggest polluters—most of the top 20 are major energy generators. So there are significant issues for the electricity generation industry that flow from the carbon tax. But the issues in Western Australia are very different from the issues faced in the eastern states, and that is because the eastern states are part of what is erroneously described as the

                               There are two major energy providers in Western Australia:

                               , a state owned energy operator; and Griffin Energy. Verve Energy will pay about $250 million a year in carbon tax, because they put out 8½ million tonnes of CO2 emissions, times 23 and moving forward. It will average out over the next however many years, to about $250 million a year, with all of the bits and pieces. The more polluting energy generators in Victoria, like the brown coal generators, get transitional assistance. The

                               energy generators do not. Why? Because they are too clean! But these are the sorts of issues that we need to debate, and this government is not prepared to debate them. So Western Australian electricity generators, because they are less polluting than energy generators in other parts of Australia, will get zero dollars transitional assistance. And I cannot believe that Senator Glenn Sterle and Senator Mark Bishop and Senator Chris Evans and Senator Louise Pratt have done nothing to stand up for Western Australia when it come to the implications of the carbon tax for Western Australia. There they are, doing the bidding of this most eastern-state-centric, most arrogant, most Canberra-centric government we have had in the history of Federation, a government which gives Western Australia the raw end of the stick whenever it gets the opportunity, a government which sponsored an inquiry into the carbon tax which was not even prepared to go and listen to any of the people, any of the stakeholders, any of the businesses, any of the organisations that are going to be severely impacted by the carbon tax. This is no doubt why the government wants to gag debate on the carbon tax but is quite happy to have a lengthy debate on the proposal that we have an exemption for the Business Names Registration Bill 2011 and various other bills from the provisions of standing order 111(5) to (8), because people like Senator Sterle and Senator Bishop and Senator Evans and Senator Pratt are embarrassed about the fact that they have let down the people of Western Australia by supporting this carbon tax, which will hurt

Senator Sterle, who is here in the chamber, knows that the longer we talk about this the more upset people in Western Australia will become about his lack of advocacy and his lack of representation here in this chamber for the great state of Western Australia.

                               The carbon tax which the Labor Party and the Greens political party want to impose on the Australian people will impose a lot of economic pain for no environmental gain. A Senate inquiry commissioned by the Senate to look into the carbon tax has found that it will cost the Australian economy more than $1 trillion between now and 2050. No wonder that the government does not want to talk about this. The government is clearly embarrassed about this. The government does not want the people of Australia to be exposed to the sort of evidence discovered by the Senate carbon tax inquiry. A loss of $1 trillion out of the economy over the next 40 years—in today's dollars, I hasten to add—effectively means that Australians will have to work for a whole year for nothing. That $1 trillion is just about Australia's

                               Minister Combet came out and pulled the usual spin trick. He said, 'The economy is going to continue to grow, the GDP will more than double, it will increase by $2.3 trillion.' The fact that something increases does not mean that you are not losing money. No wonder these guys cannot manage our public finances. Let me give you a lesson in maths, a lesson in economics. If something grows more slowly, if there is lower growth, it costs you money. If you put money away in your superannuation account and you have it there for 40 years and it grows by 2.8 per cent less than it otherwise would have, it costs you real money. If you have money in your superannuation account for 40 years and the return is 2.8 per cent less, you are going to end up with less money in retirement than you otherwise would have. And the Treasury modelling indicates that by 2050 the GDP will be 2.8 per cent lower than it otherwise would be, costing $100 billion in today's dollars in 2050 alone. Cumulatively between now and 2050 it will—
