        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. But before I ask my question I just want to acknowledge that the situation outside Kabul, of course, is extremely difficult and fluid, and I'd like to thank Ministers Payne and Hawke for working with Greens senators over the last week to try to get people evacuated. Given the humanitarian crisis facing the people of Afghanistan, the Canadian and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        governments have announced that they will take an extra 20,000 refugees, whilst Australia has committed to only 3,000 within the existing capped program. The Prime Minister says 3,000 is just a floor, not a ceiling. Why won't Mr Morrison then do what Mr Abbott did in 2015: match what other countries are doing and give more places to refugees fleeing Afghanistan, making sure that Australia stands by those who stand by us?

         [by video link] I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her question and I thank her for the acknowledgement of those ministers who have been engaging with Greens senators in relation to assisting with the extraction of individuals from Afghanistan. Indeed, can I thank many members of the Senate and across the parliament for engagement with local constituencies on those matters and particularly, whilst I know ministers are working hard on it, I thank those many officials working around the clock to do so, especially the officials from various agencies who have been redeployed either to the

         or to Afghanistan to help in these dangerous and challenging circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Hanson-Young, indeed the government does recognise the humanitarian challenges that exist in relation to what is occurring in Afghanistan. It is why we've made the swift announcement in relation to there being 3,000 places this financial year, in this current financial year's humanitarian intake, to be dedicated to ensuring that Afghani citizens are offered permanent protection in Australia. Since 1 July 2013 more than 8Â½ thousand visas have been granted to Afghani citizens under Australia's humanitarian visa program. We remain committed to working carefully to give priority to persecuted minorities, to women and children and to those who have links to Australia, such as family members. We'll work as always through the processes to ensure that applicants satisfy public interest criteria for character, security and health, making sure that we do keep the safety and security of Australians as being of paramount importance. Importantly, we'll work with Afghan community leaders in Australia through this process. We'll also work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help to identify those most in need.

           Currently, 4,400 Afghans reside in Australia on temporary visas. Why won't the Prime Minister give them permanent protection? They're here already. Many have been here for many, many years. They can't go back. Why not end their limbo now, allowing them to rebuild their lives without the fear of the Taliban? Where is the Prime Minister's compassion for those who are already here so that they can call Australia home?

            [by video link] This is indeed a sensitive issue and topic. It is sensitive because we wish to make clear that, obviously, in all of the current circumstances and for the foreseeable future, given the security situation in Afghanistan, nobody is going to be repatriated or expected to return to Afghanistan, given the threats that may exist. However, it's also important, in terms of the protection of life and the protection of our migration system in a way that enables us to make decisions to prioritise those most in need and most appropriate to be allowed to come to Australia, that we maintain confidence and order in the migration program. That requires us to make sure that the policy settings we've put in place that have stopped the tragic flow of boats to Australiaâa tragic flow of boats that saw so many people lose their lives, that saw people smugglers gain an upper hand and take advantage of vulnerable peopleâdoesn't have any opportunity to restart. That's why we're keeping in place policies that stopped that.

              The double standard of this government never ceases to amaze. On the same day as trumpeting a new agricultural visa which provides a permanent pathway for agricultural workers, the Prime Minister is refusing to allow people who are already here on Australian soil to stay here permanently to rebuild their lives. How is this fair? How is it fair to leave these people living in limbo while opening up the door to others?

               [by video link] What's not fair is to have a circumstance where people smugglers across different parts of Asia take advantage of some of the most vulnerable people: take advantage by taking their money; take advantage by putting them on rickety boats, dangerous boats; take advantage by putting them in harm's way, where they may find themselves losing their lives on a perilous journey to Australia, as many others did before. What wouldn't be fair would be if community confidence in our humanitarian program, our migration program, were undermined to the extent that we were unable to continue to be one of the most generous countries in the world on a per capita basis when it comes to the resettlement of refugees. It wouldn't be fair if it were undermined to the extent that we were unable to make the types of decisions we have made to put a dedicated number of places in place to support Afghani citizens. That's why it's important that we maintain confident settings in those programs so that we can give priority where appropriate by maintaining that community confidence in an orderly system.
