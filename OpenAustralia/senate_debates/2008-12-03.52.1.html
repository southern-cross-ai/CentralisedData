        In the few moments prior to question time I will take the opportunity to highlight the merits of the health forum recently held in Launceston on the issues of public hospitals, rural health and the responsible consumption of alcohol. It was hosted by Senator Richard Colbeck, myself and the Tasmanian women’s council of the Liberal Party.

        Guest speaker was the Hon.

       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Jim Markos gave an outstanding address and an important contribution on the importance of adequate funding for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston General Hospital
        </a>
        and for public hospitals generally in Tasmania. Colleen McGann talked about the importance of accountability and responsibility for both private and public hospitals, and the importance of a balance between the two across the health sector. In terms of the panel session on public hospitals, we also had input from Professor Bernie Einodor, an orthopaedic surgeon based in Launceston, who gave an excellent contribution which was very much appreciated by the people participating in the forum.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of rural health we had special presentations from Mr David Downie, Chair of the Campbell Town Health Centre; and Mr Michael Ball on behalf of the Ouse Hospital Action Committee. That action committee was very vigorous in their protestations over the closure of the Ouse Hospital and referred to the closure of the Roseberry Hospital by the state Labor government in Tasmania prior to the last election. I commend them for their advocacy on behalf of their community.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Jones" rel="nofollow">

        Reference was made to the importance of the

        standing up for their community in terms of the closure of the Roseberry Hospital, and the Roseberry Hospital Action Committee was acknowledged as well. In terms of the responsible consumption of alcohol panel, we had a contribution from Mr Sam McQuestin, Manager of Jimmy’s Liquor outlets in Launceston, who is also president of the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party.

          Indeed, Senator Mason, he is a fine individual and he gave an excellent presentation. Mr Chris McIndoe from the Heritage Hotel in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
           George Town
          </a>
          presented his own views on the importance of the supply of alcohol and the importance from his perspective of limiting supply. We appreciated his input. Dr Michael Aizen is a past president of the AMA in Tasmania and presented his own views on the responsible consumption of alcohol.
         </p>
         <p>
          We also had the benefit of Inspector Reynolds from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania_Police" rel="nofollow">
           Tasmania Police
          </a>
          . We want to thank the police for the important role they play in ensuring that alcohol is consumed at an appropriate time and place. A number of recommendations have been prepared and they will be an important contribution to not only the state and federal levels of the Liberal Party but also public policy, and we appreciate the contribution—
