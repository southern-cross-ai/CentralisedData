        The Bill outlines specific provisions in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Criminal Code
        </a>
        1995 related to the definitions relating to terrorism offences, provisions relating to the proscription of `terrorist organisations', offences relating to interaction with 'terrorist organisations', 'reckless possession of a thing' and the offence of sedition, provisions in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Crimes Act
        </a>
        1914 relating to detention of terrorism suspects, provisions in the Australian Security In formation Organisation Act 1979 relating to the questioning of terrorism suspects and the detention of terrorism suspects; and repeals the National Security Information Act 2004. The Bill seeks to implement the recommendations and findings of reviews that have been held in response to particular situations arising from the terror laws, Haneef etc, and the objections of leading legal organisations and advocates to particular provisions of the anti-terrorism laws, which were passed in haste. Australia's parliament and community did not get an opportunity to hold a thorough, calm and considered debate over the terrorism laws when they were introduce, an inquiry into these components of the laws offers such an opportunity.
