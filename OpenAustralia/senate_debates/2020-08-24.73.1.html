        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. The explosion in Beirut was a shocking and distressing event that has rightly mobilised the international community. Can the minister detail Australia's support to the people of Lebanon in the wake of the shocking explosion on 4 August?

         I thank Senator Molan very much for his question. Many Australians have been deeply saddened by the catastrophic explosion in Beirut, and our thoughts and sympathies go to all those affected by the tragedy, both here and in Lebanon, and most particularly to the family and the loved ones of Australian toddler Isaac Oehlers, who tragically died in the blast.
        </p>
        <p>
         Soon after the explosion, Australia was able to announce $5 million in humanitarian assistance, which has been provided through international organisations, particularly the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme" rel="nofollow">
          World Food Programme
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">

         and Red Crescent Movement, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Children's_Fund" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Children's Fund
         </a>
         . We have also delivered urgently needed humanitarian supplies, prepositioned at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai, and have provided those to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
          NGO
         </a>
         partners leading the response in Beirut. On Friday 14 August, a Dubai based ADF C-130 delivered mobile warehouses to help replace critical storage facilities destroyed in the blast and also shelter kits and tools for the up to 300,000 people left homeless. Then, last Friday, the ADF completed a second delivery of additional shelter materials. I acknowledge the support of those personnel in effecting those deliveries.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those supplies were chosen after consultation with the humanitarian organisations that are leading the response in Beirut and were certainly targeted to fill the gaps and meet the most urgent needs. We'll continue to work with other international donors on possible further support. Our support will be based on need, on our ability to provide assistance in a timely manner and also, in particular, on what other countries are already doing in the context of the international response.

            The Australian embassy in Beirut was itself significantly damaged in the blast. Fortunately, only minor injuries were experienced by staff, and we appreciate the support provided to them to address those injuries. I don't, however, underestimate the psychological challenge that accompanies the experience that those staff have had, and I acknowledge the ambassador and her team for the very professional work that they are doing. They've been working constantly to help Australians, and we deployed additional staff to Beirut to assist in the response as well. Our staff are providing consular assistance, working actively to identify opportunities for Australians in Beirut to depart, particularly in terms of the current incoming passenger restrictions, which do make that harder. They're providing many essential services, including the provision of emergency passports, and are also continuing to make inquiries of local authorities—there are always many dual nationals in Beirut, and in Lebanon more broadly—about any further support that may be required by people in those circumstances.

               There has certainly been an outpouring of support from Australia's Lebanese community. It's admirable. It reminded us of the close relationship between our two countries, particularly through the almost quarter-of-a-million Australians of Lebanese heritage. Since the explosion, the government has convened a series of special teleconference meetings with leaders of the Australian Lebanese community. Minister Tudge and I attended one of those meetings, Minister Hawke another. They've been very important chances both to convey our condolences and to listen to the community's priorities as they are applied here in Australia and also to family and extended contacts in Lebanon. For any Australians who wish to help, we do encourage them to provide a cash donation to trusted organisations that are delivering this urgently needed humanitarian assistance. We're working with the Lebanese community on the best mechanisms to achieve this, and we certainly thank them for the commitment that they are bringing to the task.
