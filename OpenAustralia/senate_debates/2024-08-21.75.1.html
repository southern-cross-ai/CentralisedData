        Two weeks ago, Australia's general terrorism threat level was raised to 'probable'. That means there is a greater than 50 per cent chance of an onshore attack or attack planning in the next 12 months.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        , has warned Australians that religiously motivated violent extremists and ideologically motivated groups are increasingly hard to track. So why is an organisation like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hizbut_Tahrir" rel="nofollow">
         Hizbut Tahrir
        </a>
        still operating in this country? This group's stated aim is to establish an Islamic caliphate and call Muslims living in Western countries like this one to—and I quote—'come out of the illusion of their cozy relationship with the West and embrace the struggle of Islam versus nonbelievers.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Twenty years ago,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        police and counterterrorism departments had a list of organisations they wanted listed as terrorist organisations. One of the groups they were tracking was—guess who? That's right: Hizbut Tahrir. Twenty years later, not only is this group still operating; it is infiltrating protest groups on our streets and in our universities, spreading their extremist filth and whipping up hatred.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the
        <i>
         Age
        </i>
        , Hizbut Tahrir are using front groups to infiltrate the university encampment and pro-Palestinian movements. One of these groups, Stand for Palestine, works in coalition with other Palestinian groups who are often unaware of their extremist connections. In just a few months, this organisation has gained thousands of followers, has stepped up its presence in our mosques and is radicalising our youth. In May, a Sydney sheikh led protesters through Sydney university chanting free Palestine slogans, and just hours later the footage was edited by Al-Aksha Bhuiyan and spread online by Stand for Palestine. In social media posts, Bhuiyan has written that Muslims will 'continue resisting until Israel is completely wiped off the map, from the river to the sea'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hizbut Tahrir are banned in China, Russia, Pakistan, Germany, Turkiye, the United Kingdom, Indonesia and all Arab countries except Lebanon, Yemen and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE" rel="nofollow">
         UAE
        </a>
        . One of the criteria for listing a terrorist organisation is that like-minded countries have done so. Is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        not a like-minded country? We're in a strategic relationship with them. It doesn't get any more like-minded than that for sure. When British home secretary
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cleverly" rel="nofollow">
         James Cleverly
        </a>
        announced that they would be declared a terrorist organisation, he said that the group was 'an antisemitic organisation that actively promotes and encourages terrorism, including praising and celebrating the appalling 7 October attacks.' Deakin University's extremist expert Josh Roose told the
        <i>
         Age
        </i>
        that Hizbut Tahrir has seized on the violence in Gaza as 'their chance to shine'.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is the Australian government doing about this? Not only have we not listed them as a declared terrorist organisation; according to the investigation by the
        <i>
         Age
        </i>
        , Australian authorities have registered and given special tax status to a charity directed by a key figure within Hizbut Tahrir, who has urged Muslims to send weapons to Gaza. We've got a front group for a terrorist organisation that multiple countries, including like-minded ones and Muslim countries, have proscribed as a terrorist organisation. What has the Australian government done? We've let a member of the organisation start up a charity. That's right, Australians! 'Come to Australia if you're a terrorist group. We'll give you a charity organisation to start up.' How is that leading by example, and how is that possibly keeping this country safe?
       </p>
       <p>
        You cannot be serious about the stuff; you seriously couldn't make this up! To Australians, they've done this to an organisation so they can get tax deductions. That's right. What a dirty, filthy way of giving someone tax deductions, seriously. The charity commission and the Australian government shouldn't waste any more time dealing with this. Seriously, what other terrorist organisations do you want to be taking Australian taxpayer dollars? Is that what you want? You have to do something about this. You can't keep turning a blind eye to this. You have to start leading by the front foot, and let them know we're not putting up with this rubbish. Take their tax deduction status off them, and do it right now. I want to start seeing some courage in here. Take that tax deduction status off them.
