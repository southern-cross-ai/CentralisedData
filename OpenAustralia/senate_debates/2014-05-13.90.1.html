          which coincidentally, Senator Conroy would be interested to know, refers to events of Tuesday, 14 May 2013, which was budget day last year—my name is mentioned.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Carr" rel="nofollow">
           Bob Carr
          </a>
          writes about what he says must be the last caucus before the election. He writes:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Lower House MPs must be looking around the room, thinking this place will be cleaned out, half of 'the colleagues' gone from the next parliament, they themselves. I haven't even gotten to learn their names.'
         </p>
         <p>
          A little later he said, '
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Faulkner" rel="nofollow">
           John Faulkner
          </a>
          says the meeting is like a mausoleum but not to quote him, because he plans to use it in his book.'
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr Deputy President, let me make these points. First, I do acknowledge that I said to Bob Carr in a private conversation that attending the caucus meeting was like visiting a mausoleum. Second, I didn't ask Bob not to quote me; I had no thought that he ever would and no idea he was writing a book. Third, I certainly did not suggest I would use the line about caucus being like a mausoleum in my own book. I have never had any plans—not then, not now—to bore people senseless by writing such a book.
         </p>
         <p>
          I make this personal explanation because this brief passage about me from Bob's book was extracted and highlighted in a number of newspapers at the time of the book's release. And, Mr Deputy President, I really don't want anyone to think that I am such a wally and so pompous and self-important that I would ever say such a thing to anyone at all—let alone to someone who was likely to publish it.
