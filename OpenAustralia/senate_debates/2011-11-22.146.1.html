        (1) Is the Minister aware of any products imported into Australia that have originated in full or in part from Israeli settlements in the occupied territories or in Israeli industrial zones in the occupied territories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) (a) Is the government satisfied that all goods originating from Israel or the occupied territories are truthfully labelled with their place or places of origin; and (b) does the government require this differentiation on labels or import documentation; if not, why not.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Is the Minister aware of the

         Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
        </a>
        or any other government agency taking action against companies that label goods 'Made in Israel' when they are actually made partly or in full in the occupied territories; if so, what was that action and was there any remedy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Is the Minister or Austrade officials, who cover Israel and Palestine, aware of any contracts and/or agreements between Australian and Israeli companies to conduct research or business in the occupied territories, including in Israeli industrial zones in the occupied territories; if so, can details be provided of these arrangements.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>

          UNLOCODE

          Palestinian Territories
         </a>

        <p class="italic">
         The Health and Ageing and Home Affairs portfolios administer product labelling on imported goods.

        </p>

See also the response to question 1.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) No.
