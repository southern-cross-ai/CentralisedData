        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the report of the committee on migration and multiculturalism in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be printed.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since my time in the Senate I have had the honour of being a member of, and involved in, the joint standing committee inquiring into the economic, social and cultural impacts of migration in Australia. The task of the inquiry encompassed multiculturalism, social inclusion and globalisation through the settlement and participation of newly arrived migrants, including those who have arrived as refugees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the chair of this committee, Ms
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Vamvakinou" rel="nofollow">
         Maria Vamvakinou
        </a>
        , who led this inquiry with compassion, strength and a strong sense of understanding. The terms of reference for the inquiry resulted in over 500 submissions, and the nature of this kind of inquiry led to the committee undertaking 27 public hearings over a two-year period, these hearings requiring a genuine listening ear from all those involved. I am pleased this committee has embraced multiculturalism, and the report I am tabling in the Senate today has received strong bipartisan support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am a strong advocate of our multicultural society, one that celebrates its diversity and recognises the contribution of our rich multicultural fabric. At times, however, I am both puzzled and appalled by the language used around this very issue. In a nation built on the back of migrants I cannot quite understand why we continue to divorce ourselves from the benefits of multicultural Australia and what it has brought to our society. It continues to enrich us, not just economically but also socially and culturally. It is my hope that we, as elected representatives of our constituency, come to the realisation that we are doing more harm than good when we start alienating citizens of our own country. The truth is we are a welcoming country—a country of over 22 million people, speaking over 260 languages and identifying with more than 270 ancestries. Our society continues to be enriched through the positive benefits of migrants and refugees, with migration accounting for 44 per cent of total job growth in the past five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our model of multiculturalism is envied throughout the world and our settlement services are recognised as one of the world's best. These services are at the core of our migration program. I believe this report is a testament to Australia's ability to develop a strong social and culturally diverse society. Through government leadership and cultural understanding we have developed a cohesive Australia. I, along with some of my colleagues, have a personal appreciation for culturally diverse backgrounds. I am the daughter of an international student who arrived in Australia in 1963 and some of the members of parliament are sons and daughters of migrant parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe it is only through the acknowledgement and understanding of our heritage that we will be able to achieve a resilient multicultural nation. We know, however, that there can be challenges for newly arrived migrants and those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. It is for this reason it is vital that we continue to work together to combat areas of discrimination in our community and encourage all generations of our society to embrace our differences. A belief in equality is at the forefront of ensuring that we have a long-term cohesive society, ensuring all individuals have access to the same opportunities in life, regardless of their background. We would not be doing justice to our society if we did not continue to review and evolve our settlement services and our migration system.
       </p>
       <p>
        This inquiry allowed for the committee to delve into these very issues that are facing communities throughout Australia. It provided an opportunity for the committee to focus on the settlement services and the integration and participation of both new and established communities. The report I am tabling today makes 32 recommendations on how we can build on what we have already achieved in promoting a rich multicultural nation, supportive of giving all citizens the very best opportunities in Australian life. In order to achieve the very best settlement process, it is integral that we have a whole-of-government approach. Through the involvement of all three tiers of government, settlement in Australia can be very much a positive experience. The report has noted this approach is necessary and enhanced results in this area of settlement can be obtained through better coordination from all levels of government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee's recommendations included rebuilding Australia's research capability in this area, factoring cultural and linguistic diversity into the government's social inclusion agenda, greater flexibility in English-language training and support for micro enterprises. The committee acknowledges there still remain obstacles for some Australians in the area of job security and opportunities. It is a concern that many qualified residents are unable to have their overseas qualifications recognised here in Australia. These issues, if unresolved, can have a negative flow-on effect to a number of communities. The committee has also established that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Services_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Job Services Australia
        </a>
        needs to develop a better system of delivering services to people from diverse backgrounds, including refugees.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is clear is multiculturalism is embedded in our national identity and it is something we need to start clearly embracing. Whilst this report identifies what we need to improve on, it also recognises what we have achieved. I want to thank all of those who contributed to the report through their submissions and public hearings. I want to thank the secretariat and all the members of the committee for their work and their commitment. Once again, I highlight the valuable role of the chair, Maria Vamvakinou. Lastly, I want to thank the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bowen" rel="nofollow">

        for showing leadership in this area and referring this matter to the inquiry. I commend the recommendations to the government and to the parliament.

         I too rise to speak to the Joint Standing Committee Report on Migration and Multiculturalism in Australia, of which I was a member. Coalition members and senators acknowledge the significant contribution of all who contributed to this inquiry. The terms of reference were broad and the level of community interest considerable given the numerous submissions to the inquiry itself. The committee members worked together throughout the inquiry to achieve a collaborative report.
        </p>
        <p>
         You would be aware that the coalition under the former Howard government introduced multicultural policies and programs that signified the coalition's strong and enduring commitment to community harmony, and a migration program that does not discriminate on the basis of ethnic origin, gender, race or religion. A decade ago the then coalition minister for immigration the Hon. Philip Ruddock MP, recognised the value of multicultural policies and programs and stated in
         <i>
          Multicultural Australia: United In Diversity
         </i>
         policy, the following:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This non-discriminatory migration program has brought people from across the globe and with them their diverse cultural heritages. About six million migrants have settled in Australia since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         . They have made an enormous contribution to Australia, along with the unique contribution of Australia’s Indigenous people, earlier migrants and their descendants. Together, we have built a country that is vibrant, successful and outward looking, a country that provided safe haven for the dispossessed, and a bright future for us all.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia today is a culturally and linguistically diverse society and will remain so. Like our sophisticated migration program, our multicultural policy continues our tradition of successful nation building. It will help us to ensure that we meet the challenge of drawing the best from the many histories and cultures of the Australian people, within a framework of a uniting set of Australian values.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no doubt that Australia as a nation has a successful migration policy. The success of our migration policy, however, is no accident; it is the result of a carefully planned, merits based, non-discriminatory and orderly immigration program that has, by and large, generally received the overwhelming support of the Australian community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Underpinning Australia's migration program has been a settlement policy that was aimed at enabling people to adopt their new society by embracing our values, learning English, getting a job and getting involved in Australian life. In past decades the primary focus of multiculturalism was to build an appreciation of ethnic and cultural diversity and to combat the intolerance and discrimination that was denying Australians the opportunity to fully participate in the Australian way of life. It has been a success in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Howard government's policy statement
         <i>
          A new agenda for multicultural Australi
         </i>
         <i>
          a
         </i>
         sought to broaden its multicultural policy and adopted the term 'Australian multiculturalism', which was intended to bring a greater focus on what communities had in common as Australians. It said that the Commonwealth government's 'vision is of a vigorous, multicultural Australia, united by a shared future, an overriding commitment to our nation and its democratic institutions and values, and support for the rule of law, with English as a common language.' The policy deliberately set out to explicitly recognise the significance of Australian values—in particular, the primacy of the English language, respect for existing institutions and adherence to the rule of law.
        </p>
        <p>
         When debating the issue of multiculturalism, coalition members and senators on the committee are of the opinion that focusing on the generality of whether one is for or against multiculturalism is self-defeating and divisive. Coalition members and senators believe it is important to acknowledge that a consensus has emerged on the existence and benefits of ethnic, racial and religious diversity in our society. Having affirmed this consensus as policymakers, the parliament must then ask itself what practical policies are needed to promote the benefits of ethnic, racial and religious diversity in our society and remove emerging barriers that seek to diminish these benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the recommendations in the majority report I make the following comments. In relation to recommendations 4 to 6 I reiterate that coalition members and senators are of the view that all Australians must understand that cultural tolerance is not a licence for cultural practices that are offensive to the cultural values and laws of Australia and that our respect for diversity does not provide a licence for the establishment and maintenance of closed communities. Such practices are in direct conflict with the overwhelming experience, spirit and practice of immigration to Australia, where people have come to join us and not change us. In that regard, coalition members and senators fully endorse committee recommendation (6) that states: 'The committee does not support legal pluralism.'
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to settlement and participation, recommendations 18 to 24, coalition members and senators recognise that, in order to integrate and to gain employment in Australia, migrants must have a command of the English language. Coalition members and senators acknowledge the role that the AMEP has in this regard. We also note, however, the criticisms that have been made of the AMEP in relation to its effectiveness. Coalition members and senators also note
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AE" rel="nofollow">
          AE
         </a>
         12/0466, provided in response to a question on notice from myself during the additional Senate estimates hearing on 13 February 2012, whereby the minister admitted that in 2010-11 64 per cent of the AMEP participants did not obtain functional English. A further 14 per cent of participants were awarded statements of attainment, which are conferred for attendance only as opposed to being a measure of actual skill or acquisition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, the coalition members and senators on the committee support recommendations 3, 14, 15, 17, 19 and 32 in principle. However, as we are fiscally conservative and fiscally prudent, we are mindful that the recommendations would involve the expenditure of new funds. Coalition members and senators consider that these recommendations ought to be implemented by government only if they can be undertaken within existing budgetary parameters.
