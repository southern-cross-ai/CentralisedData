        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACOSS" rel="nofollow">
         ACOSS
        </a>
        launched a new report,
        <i>
         How JobSeeker and other income support payments are falling behind the cost of living.
        </i>
        We already know Australians are suffering the worst cost-of-living crisis in generations. The report reveals just how bad this is: 62 per cent of low-income earners are eating less or skipping meals; 71 per cent are cutting back on meat, fresh fruit and vegetables; almost half of low-income owners spend half of their income on rent; 71 per cent of low-income earners have been cutting back on heating over winter. When will the government raise the rate above $48 per day and lift millions of Australians out of poverty?

         I thank Senator Pocock for that very important question. The issue is one that the current government takes very seriously, and it appreciates the sentiment and the sincerity in which you have raised this issue. I'll make a couple of observations about the process.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, there will be an indexation process in the October budget. We know from statements already made by the Prime Minister that he is obviously concerned about the issue, concerned about the people who find themselves in those situations. He has undertaken to look closely at the issue and to see what can be done in what is a very difficult budgetary circumstance. We were left with $1 trillion worth of debt, as has been said already, by the previous government—the highest-taxing and highest-spending government in history. That's left us with an extremely difficult set of financial circumstances to deal with. The Prime Minister understands the issues that people in these circumstances find themselves, and he has undertaken that he will look at the issue.

            Thank you again, Senator Pocock, for your question and for your concern in this space. I'd make this observation: it's not customary for ministers, particularly ministers like myself, to reveal what may or may not be in the budget. That's for the Treasurer to deal with, and he will deal that in due course. We don't have very long to wait to find out what will be in what will be the first Albanese budget. However, I can say this: five million people—

              We hear much from the government about tough challenges and tough choices that the government face. This is about choices. What do you say to Canberrans like Sam and Leilani, who are here today, about whether they should choose between housing or heating? What do you say to them when you are subsidising a fossil fuel industry that's making record profits, to the tune of billions of dollars of taxpayer money?

                 Look, I've answered all of the questions as honestly as I can. I wish that, with the wave of a wand, we could solve every difficult financial issue that we were left by the incompetent coalition government over the last nine years. We're not going to be able to do that, but we understand the issues, and I can only repeat what the Prime Minister has already said: it's his intention to look at this issue from now on in respect of every budget.
