           <dt>
            (i)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            record high prices of petrol in Australia are likely to increase due to recent wars in the Middle East, a diminishing number of significant oil reserves being discovered in the past decade and world-wide demand that is expected to exceed production sometime between 2010 and 2025,
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (ii)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            Australian oil production has diminished and currently around 65 per cent of all oil consumed is imported, and
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (iii)
           </dt>

           <dt>
            (ii)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            the Government has consistently undermined alternative fuels, imposing excise commencing in 2012, cutting excise on diesel, forcing onerous testing on small biodiesel producers and providing billions of dollars to the auto industry without leveraging fuel efficiency or alternative fuel conversions; and
