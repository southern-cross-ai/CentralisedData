           It is pretty clear that the coalition do not want to hear the good news. They do not want to hear the good news about infrastructure being rolled out to local councils. They neglected them for 12 years. Who are the biggest supporters of this program in the country? Liberal mayors. Every time I go out and help announce one of these programs, a Liberal mayor—

               I am happy to answer the question because it is good news for the government. A Liberal mayor actually said to me at the time: ‘This is a fantastic program.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
                The Liberals

                 . It is an extremely successful program and the Liberals on the ground, in your own electorates, think it is fantastic. Just for the record, when you get out into your electorates—because you do not actually get out into them—talk to the mayors, because they think it is fantastic. In relation to funding, Senator Eggleston has raised a number of issues, so I am going to put on record that there are $800 million in this program. And when you do a partisan, party political analysis, the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
                  ALP
                 </a>
                 gets across the country 53 per cent of the funding—shock, horror. But guess what? When you actually look at how many MPs we have, 55 per cent of the members in the House of Representatives receive 53 per cent of the funding.

                   . I have to say that the shadow minister for workplace relations was not complaining. He was out there with a jackhammer, remember? Senator Evans had a photo of him out there with a jackhammer and with the construction hat on. Mr Keenan thinks it is a good program. He has welcomed it. He is out there with thumbs up on the project. And so is the

                   government, who believe the stimulus is needed. It is in the interests of the country, it is in the interests of Western Australia and it is something that all Liberal and National Party senators need to keep in mind. If you want to roll back the stimulus, tell us what infrastructure projects you will cut.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Perhaps the minister can explain why Labor-held seats in Victoria received almost 25 per cent more per seat on average than coalition-held seats? And can the minister honestly deny that political considerations had no influence on the federal government’s decisions in how to distribute its $550 million so-called community infrastructure fund?

                     Again, I inform the Senate that the program was not $550 million. The total local government program was $800 million. Of that $800 million, 53 per cent went to Labor electorates—remembering that 55 per cent of members of the House of Representatives are Labor. It was 53 per cent funding for 55 per cent. The coalition seats received 41 per cent of the funding across the country and you make up 42.6 per cent of the House of Representatives.

                    <p>
                     I also put on record, concerning the $550 million competitive element of the fund, that 137 projects were assessed independently by external auditors such as PricewaterhouseCoopers and McGrathNicol. Independent assessments, again, are something the Liberal Party knows nothing about.
