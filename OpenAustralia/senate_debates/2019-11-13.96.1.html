           The government has zero tolerance for any exploitation of workers. Having yet another talkfest on this matter is entirely unnecessary. Now is the time for action. We know the issues, we have seen the evidence and it is this government that is actually doing something about it. We have given the regulators more funding and more powers. We have increased the penalties for non-compliance. We have laws before the Senate to prevent the improper use of worker benefits and to recover unpaid superannuation. We are drafting tough new laws to criminalise wage theft and we are consulting on even more penalties, powers and tools for the courts to crack down on employers who don't give their employees what they are owed. Action is what's needed and action is precisely what is happening.
