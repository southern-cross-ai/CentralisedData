       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

        The statement read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Purpose of the Bills
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bills implement the government’s commitment to establish a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
         CPRS
        </a>
        ). They provide for the establishment of a scheme regulator and a registry, and address such matters as emissions coverage of the scheme, emissions caps, the definition of liable entities, obligations on liable entities to surrender emissions units to match emissions for which the entity is liable, allocation of emissions units, and the use of international units for compliance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bills are required to address the urgent need to respond to climate change through the CPRS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bills give effect to the outcomes of negotiations agreed by the government and the opposition in November 2009. Provisions that give effect to these agreed outcomes were considered in detail by the Senate committee of the whole in November and December 2009. The CPRS is the key mechanism for meeting emissions reduction targets that have the support of both the government and the opposition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Uncertainty created by delay in the passage of the bills raises risks for business regarding the future costs of climate change action, and is hampering investments that enable the transformation to a low-carbon pollution economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some elements of the CPRS, such as the crediting of carbon sequestration by reforestation projects, commence on 1 July 2010, and passage will enable businesses and farmers who intend to participate in the scheme to design and commence their projects. Passage of the legislation would also give business time to prepare for the CPRS and associated regulations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduction and passage of the bills in the same sittings will not limit consideration by the Senate. There has been ample opportunity for proper consideration of the bills, consistent with the government’s longstanding commitment to ensuring adequate scrutiny and debate of proposed legislation. The content of the proposed legislation and government policy underpinning the scheme have been considered in depth by the parliament in 2009, including through inquiries by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics into exposure draft bills in March-April 2009 and into the 2009 bills in May-June 2009, a number of other Senate and select committee inquiries that examined aspects of climate change, and extensive debate in both Houses of the parliament from the first introduction of the bills during the winter and spring 2009 sittings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to deal with the bills will result in continued uncertainty for business and further delay in new investments which will lead to a low pollution economy.
       </p>
