        On 17 April the well-known
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon" rel="nofollow">
         Boston Marathon
        </a>
        will be held yet again. What is not well known is that 50 years ago, in 1967,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathrine_Switzer" rel="nofollow">
         Kathrine Switzer
        </a>
        donned bib No. 261. That of itself may seem unremarkable but for the fact Kathrine Switzer was the first woman to run the marathon and at the two-mile mark the race director tried to remove her from the race. You see, it was considered a men's only event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then bib No. 261 has taken on special significance, with Kathrine Switzer establishing a charity, 261
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless" rel="nofollow">
         Fearless
        </a>
        , to help empower women globally through communication platforms, clubs, training opportunities, education, ambassadors, merchandising and events. Through these networking opportunities 261 Fearless breaks down barriers of geography and creates a global community for women runners of all abilities to support and talk to each other, encouraging healthy living and a positive sense of self and fearlessness. So from those humble beginnings has grown a celebrated network.
       </p>
       <p>
        To mark the 50th anniversary of Kathrine Switzer's groundbreaking run, she will take part in this year's Boston Marathon with an extra 100 charity women running alongside her, chosen from around the world, including two from Australia. One of those 100 is our very own Sydney lady Lesley Mason, who will be lining up with Kathrine Switzer on 17 April in Boston. I am sure all Australians wish Lesley safe travels, energy to run the marathon and, above all, success in her fundraising target to contribute over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        $7,000 to 261 FEARLESS, a target which Lesley has now well and truly exceeded thanks to her many supporters—in particular, Function Physio, her platinum sponsor, who deal with her aches and pains from her numerous marathon runs, and Fisiocrem, her silver sponsor.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure all funds donated go to the benefit of 261 FEARLESS Lesley and her husband, Kilner, are covering all expenses from their own pockets. Such generosity deserves our support, let alone the commitment to run the Boston Marathon. Just google Lesley Mason 261 FEARLESS to donate—and it is not too late.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both I and the former Prime Minister the Honourable Tony Abbott, whose presence in the chamber I note, recognise and salute the effort and endeavours of Kilner and, especially, Lesley, both of whom are in the gallery this evening. I also wish all the best to the other participant, Erica King, who is not known to me personally. I wish them safe travels, good running, enjoyable times and God speed.
