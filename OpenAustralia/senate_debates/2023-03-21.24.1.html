        The voices of young people can be underestimated, but they can also be powerfulâ€”filled with hope and solutions. And they are the future of our parliament. I'm happy to have been invited to participate in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Voice
        </a>
        in Parliament campaign, spearheaded by Raise Our Voice. Raise Our Voice aims to increase the number of young, female and non-binary voices from diverse backgrounds to engage with politics. They invited young people to answer the question, 'What is your vision for Australia in 20 years?' in a short speech.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the speeches that I received was from Sasha Sri Deenathayalan, who was unfairly treated at her first job. Her working conditions were poor and she touched on the importance of work rights, especially for young people. As a proud lifelong union member myself, her speech resonated deeply with me and here it is. Sasha said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I want parliament to address workforce shortages by providing young people with the skills, safety and security of the workplace.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In doing so, putting in place things such as higher pay, incentives, policies that ensure managers do not exploit young people and their labour. In addition to this, I'd like parliament to put in place things to push the climate change agenda. I believe that sustainability will result in new jobs, secure work and a healthier future for all young people everywhere. It is important our voices are heard everywhere, but especially the workplace as this is where it all begins.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank Sasha for her contribution to the Raise Our Voice campaign. I hope she continues engaging in politics and raising her voice. I am proud to have helped her do just that today, because governments have a vital role in the future of our young people, and it's our job to make sure that voices like Sasha's are heard.
