       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2)   Is it the Australian Government's understanding that the US would be prepared to use its nuclear forces both pre-emptively and responsively in relation to both nuclear and non-nuclear (chemical, biological, conventional) threats to Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3)   What specific nuclear and non-nuclear threats does Australia face that could be countered or addressed by the use of US nuclear weapons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4)   Does Australia consider the policies outlined in the [2010

        and international humanitarian law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5)   On what basis does the department assert, in paragraph 6.34 of the Defence White Paper 2009, that Australia is 'able to rely on the nuclear forces of the United States to deter nuclear attack on Australia'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6)   Has the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Government" rel="nofollow">
         US Government
        </a>
        ever offered an explicit guarantee directly to Australia that it would be prepared to use its nuclear forces in Australia's defence; if so, when and in what form was such a guarantee made.

       <p class="italic">
        (7)   What practical steps, if any, has Australia taken since 2007 to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in its defence doctrines.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        (12)   Will the Talisman Sabre 2011 military exercises include preparations for joint military activities involving the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.

        <p>
         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) and (2)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States" rel="nofollow">
          The United States
         </a>
         Nuclear Posture Review 2010 (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR" rel="nofollow">
          NPR
         </a>
         ) declares that the United States will only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The NPR declares that the United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPT" rel="nofollow">
          NPT
         </a>
         ) and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations. The United States would counter chemical or biological weapons attacks against it, or its allies, with a conventional military response.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In regard to states which possess nuclear weapons and states which are not in compliance with the NPT obligations, the NPR states that there remains a narrow range of contingencies in which US nuclear weapons may still play a role in deterring a conventional, chemical or biological attack against the United States or its allies and partners.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The United States has also declared it will continue to strengthen conventional capabilities and reduce the role of nuclear weapons in deterring non-nuclear attacks, with the objective of making deterrence of nuclear attack on the United States or its allies and partners the sole purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia welcomed this change in declaratory policy as a significant reduction of the role of nuclear weapons in US national security strategy and made clear the view that Australia would be comfortable if the United States were to reach its objective of making deterrence of nuclear attack the sole purpose of its nuclear weapons, subject to the significant work required to establish the conditions to do so safely.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The 2009 Defence White Paper states (at para 6.23) that Australia will most likely remain a secure country over the period to 2030 and (at para 4.59) that stable nuclear deterrence will continue to be a feature of the international system for the foreseeable future, and in this context extended deterrence will continue to be viable.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Paper" rel="nofollow">
          The White Paper
         </a>
         notes a possibility that states of concern could develop the capability to couple long-range ballistic missiles with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD" rel="nofollow">
          WMD
         </a>
         warheads. The White Paper notes also that extended nuclear deterrence will be part of our defence against WMD proliferation, alongside other measures such as customs and export control regimes, and counter-proliferation activities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Australia welcomed the United States' Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) 2010 as another very substantial step by the United States towards meeting its obligations under Article
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VI" rel="nofollow">
          VI
         </a>
         of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, while maintaining an effective deterrent both for the United States, and for its allies, including Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For the time being, Australia accepts that nuclear weapons are part of the strategic environment.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australian defence policy acknowledges the value to Australia of the protection afforded by extended nuclear deterrence under the US Alliance.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Under this, as long as nuclear weapons exist, we can rely on US nuclear forces to deter nuclear attack on Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia supports the commitment in the NPR to pursue further reductions in the number of nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles held by the United States and Russia in the wake of entry into force of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, including non-strategic and non-deployed nuclear weapons aimed at achieving substantial further nuclear force reductions.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia also endorses the commitment to engage over time other nuclear weapons states, in a multilateral effort to reduce and eventually eliminate all nuclear weapons.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia is pleased that the NPR rejects the development of new nuclear weapons or the pursuit of new military missions or new capabilities for nuclear weapons, while taking measures to sustain a safe, secure and effective arsenal.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia welcomed the NPR's reaffirmation of President Obama's pledge in Prague in April 2009 that the United States will not resume testing of nuclear weapons and will seek ratification and entry into force of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Test_Ban_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
          Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) and (6) The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS
         </a>
         Treaty states that the Parties will "act to meet the common danger". As close allies, Australia and the United States consult on security matters of importance, including the policy of extended nuclear deterrence. The United States policy of extended nuclear deterrence to its allies is contained in its public statements on its nuclear policy, most recently in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) As a non-nuclear weapon state, Australia's military and defence doctrine contains no reference to nuclear weapons other than to emphasise the US guarantee under extended nuclear deterrence.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia has consistently called for deeper and irreversible reductions in the number of nuclear weapons held by all nuclear-armed states, and the reduction of the role of nuclear weapons in national security strategies.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia is working hard to achieve the entry into force of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
          Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia is also working for the negotiation of an effectively verifiable Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty and, pending that, a moratorium on the production of fissile material for weapons purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia is active in efforts to implement strengthened non-proliferation measures, such as support for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAEA" rel="nofollow">
          IAEA
         </a>
         's Additional Protocol and effective export controls.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia is working with others in the international community to reinforce the vital importance of full compliance with the NPT's non-proliferation obligations, in particular by Iran and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia is an active participant in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proliferation_Security_Initiative" rel="nofollow">
          Proliferation Security Initiative
         </a>
         , which seeks to prevent illicit trafficking in weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and related materials.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Together with Japan, Australia established the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. The Commission's independent report, launched in Tokyo in December 2009, has been seen as a major contribution to global disarmament and non-proliferation efforts.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         While the Commission was not set up, or its report written, to reflect
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         policy, much of its analysis, action agenda and recommendations are in step with the Government's own nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament policies and priorities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia and Japan have also established the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPDI" rel="nofollow">
          NPDI
         </a>
         ) to help drive implementation of non-proliferation and disarmament outcomes of the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) and (9) Australia hosts joint facilities with the United States. The Defence White Paper 2009 states (at para 11.12): the Joint Defence Facility at

        <p class="italic">
         (10) and 11) One United States Los Angeles class nuclear powered submarine participated in Talisman Sabre 2011. The United States has a policy of neither confirming nor denying whether such vessels are carrying nuclear weapons or not.
