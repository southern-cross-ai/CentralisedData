        As a senator for Queensland, particularly one from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , I am incredibly proud of the unique and special relationship our state shares with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        . Often in my travels to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        , or when meeting with visiting delegations, I'm reminded that my electorate office is actually closer to

        than it is to Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        During January, I was very privileged to join the Prime Minister on his first official visit to Papua New Guinea. I joined a delegation including our Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development" rel="nofollow">
         International Development
        </a>
        and the Pacific,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to Papua New Guinea and key Australian officials. Over three days, we were honoured to tour their national parliament, see the length and breadth of their beautiful country and of course travel to Wewak to pay our respects to the former Prime Minister, the father of Papua New Guinea,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Somare" rel="nofollow">

        , and meet with his family.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a historic event, not just for our government but for Papua New Guinea's parliamentary history. Our Prime Minister was the first foreign leader ever to make an address to the PNG parliament. I was proud to listen to the speech that he delivered as he affirmed the importance of our relationship and the strength of the connection that our two countries have.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a Queenslander, especially, I know how much we have in common with our friends across the way: a border we share; a climate we share; hopes and anxieties we share as well. And of course, we share our love for rugby league—the true religion, I think, of both Queenslanders and Papua New Guineans!
       </p>
       <p>
        As a representative of communities with deep links to PNG, it was an honour to represent our country and learn more about the closeness of our dearest relationship. So many Australians have commented on the pride that they feel that our country is finally restoring its relationships and reputation on the world stage. And I thank our host, the
