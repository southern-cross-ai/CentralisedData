               I am happy to come to that too. I am really happy to come to that. Senator Minchin proudly told the Senate and the Australian people that when it came to the appointment of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Short" rel="nofollow">
                John Short
               </a>
               , he had had many conversations with Mr McGauchie and had no intention of repeating what they were about. But to go to the substance of Senator Ronaldson’s question: if he were to ask me which date, I am not sure I could remember a date. But as both Mr Quigley and I have said, he raised with me that they were looking for someone; I suggested Mr Kaiser’s name. Did I speak to Mr Kaiser first? No, I do not believe I did. I am happy to take that on notice and I am happy to correct that if that is not the case, but I do not actually believe I did.

                , I ask a supplementary question. Of course, that was before the minister very carefully neglected to talk about ‘after’. Can we now assume, given that he intervened in the appointment, that he was also involved in discussions relating to Mr Kaiser’s exorbitant salary package? If not, did he raise his concerns with the company about the size of Mr Kaiser’s salary package given his intimate and clear role in Mr Kaiser’s appointment?

                 I thank the senator for his question. I think I have already answered the question about whether or not I knew about the salary. The answer is ‘no’. I understand it is a salary package that is very similar to the salary package that Senator Minchin was able to assist Mr
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Short" rel="nofollow">
                  John Short

                 with at Telstra. Let us be very clear: it is entirely consistent with Telstra’s package for its government affairs adviser, the former telco adviser to
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 , the former Prime Minister of Australia. I think the final part of your question was: did I raise my concerns about it? I only found out about it after. As I said, I had no further communications with Mr Quigley on this matter at all, and the first I knew about it was when they had made the appointment in the lead-up to the announcement.

Given clearly the minister spoke to Mr Kaiser after he became aware of this position, and given clearly that the minister has been involved in this process up to his eyeballs, is he now saying that it is appropriate for him to intervene in the processes of a company that he argues is at arm’s length from government?
