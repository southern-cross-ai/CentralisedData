         by leave—The government does not support Senator Siewert's motion as it duplicates work we have already carried out and that we continue to do. For example, I am advised that Woodside has been in contact with the department regarding the clearing of up to 25 hectares of vegetation at James Price Point. I understand departmental officers have reviewed the proposal and have concluded that significant impacts on matters of national environmental significance are unlikely. In its consideration of the proposal, the department took a precautionary approach and that included assuming the greater bilby was present at the site.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also understand that the department will be conducting a compliance inspection of James Price Point. That inspection will help to ensure that any activities at the site are meeting the requirements of national environmental law. I understand the compliance inspection will cover works on an access road as well as the clearing of up to 25 hectares for exploratory drilling. I am advised this inspection may be delayed into early next week as I am advised there are reports of a bushfire at the site this week.

            project from being developed in the Browse Basin. This is just the latest attempt. It is quite appropriate for the proper processes of state and federal governments to run their course, but this sort of stunt—trying to stop by a decision of the Senate a very important project for the economic development of Australia—is completely out of order. This is not only an important development for Western Austra­lia and for Australia; it is a very important development for the economic opportunities for

            in the north of Western Australia. For the Greens again to try and prevent Indigenous people in Austra­lia from maximising their opportunities in the context of developments like this is just completely outrageous and shows that they are antidevelopment at all costs. They do not believe in proper process. This is a project that should be assessed through the normal state and federal processes as they currently exist, consistent with the legislation.

               The point here is that they have not been following proper process. The government decided that this should be assessed as an uncontrolled action. It should never have been decided to assess it as an uncontrolled action. There are bilbies there. We know there are bilbies there—one adult and three babies. We know they are there, and by refusing to issue a stop-work order the government are saying that it is okay to clear the habitat of a national icon endangered species. That is what the govern­ment are saying. They are going ahead and allowing clearing to happen before this project has completed its strategic assess­ment, before the government have made their decision on heritage listing and before this project has had any environmental assess­ment. How is that proper procedure, may I ask? It isn't. It is not proper assessment.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are plenty of alternatives for this project. There are plenty of other places where this project could be put. But no, the government of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                Western Australia
               </a>
               and, it appears, the federal government and Wood­side are determined for this project to go on land that has extreme heritage value and high environmental values. This is not carrying out proper process. If the government were concerned about proper process, it would in fact issue a stop-work order, require this area to be assessed and actually assess the information that the community has collected around the existence of bilbies. The govern­ment is saying that it is okay to trash the habitat of another endangered species in this country, and the community is saying that is not acceptable.
