        Recent weeks have been incredibly tough for many Queenslanders, following ex-tropical cyclones Jasper and Kirrily in the far north, the severe storms that lashed parts of Logan and the

        and the devastating floods that swept through suburbs across Brisbane's north just last week. But, after heading out and speaking with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bray Park
        </a>
        locals impacted by floods, as we've continually seen in the past amongst the devastationâ€”the community response to natural disasters across Australia is always an excellent demonstration of our nation's character, with people pitching in and doing what they can to help their community and get people back on their feet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government has played its part in ensuring Queenslanders receive the assistance they need to begin the recovery process and start the daunting task of rebuilding. To date, the Commonwealth has released over $58 million worth of financial assistance, through the Australian government disaster recovery payment and the disaster recovery allowance, for those impacted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to first responders, the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        and those members of the community that have provided support and assistance to those impacted across the state. I also say to insurance companies that we will be watching your actions closely; do the right thing by Queenslanders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The strong collaboration between the three tiers of government has been an excellent demonstration of representatives doing what they were elected to do: putting in the hard work to help those in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The days and weeks following a natural disaster can be the hardest and most challenging, both emotionally and financially. I urge people to seek help if they need it. But, as the recovery continues over the coming months, the Albanese government will be there to do our bit to ensure that we're supporting Queenslanders through this difficult time.
