Over 87 per cent of those are in regional Australia and, so far, the highest take-up of fibre services has been in Kiama where 44 per cent of the premises passed have an active NBN connection.

           The company estimates that driving to Sydney wastes the equivalent of 30 business days a year. The business is preparing to use videoconferencing, once connected, and is planning for the nine employees to attend most of their training in this way. This is just another example of how the NBN is beginning to radically change the way that business is done in Australia.

             From the customer's perspective it's exactly the same as a regular landline. They just plug in their existing phone handset and start to make calls.
            </p>
            <p>
             This service has a monthly rental of $29.95, less than the $33.95 for Telstra's HomeLine Plus. More significantly, the Internode plan charges 18c for untimed calls to any standard fixed line phone in Australia. Using a standard telephone, voice-only customers on the NBN can say goodbye to

             charges forever. Anyone genuinely concerned about regional Australia should be backing the Gillard government's NBN. Those in that corner down there should hang their heads. You are a disgrace when it comes to representing regional Australia.

                  Those opposite want to ignore examples like I have just been talking about in Kiama. They want to ignore the fact that services are starting to be provided on the fixed wireless network—the towers that I am being asked about. We had the Geraldton customer, who said, 'I'm getting a better service at a much cheaper rate.'

                  Co. has estimated that it requires approximately 2,300 wireless sites to roll out its fixed wireless broadband network.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Roughly half of these 2,300 sites will consist of new towers and the other half will consist of transmitters co-located on existing structures such as existing mobile phone towers. Ultimately, the exact number of wireless sites will depend on the number and the kinds of sites that NBN Co. is able to acquire and the number of existing facilities that will be available to NBN Co.

                  As required by Victorian planning laws, development applications have been lodged for new telecommunications towers with local councils in the Ballarat region. These new towers will be used to deliver, as I said, the next generation of fixed wireless broadband over the NBN to rural areas that are outside the NBN's fibre footprints. For those opposite, could I point out to them that their policy in regional Victoria—

                    I think there is some very selective quoting going on. If you look at those Ballarat region who have objected in the to mobile phone towers and

                    towers I think you will find a strong thread of people who are opposed to any mobile phone tower, whether it is being built for the NBN or anything else. And they are going to be opposed to your plan to put thousands and thousands of towers across regional Victoria, across regional Ballarat. They are going to be just as opposed to your towers as they are to our towers because they actually oppose every tower.

                    Senator Madigan is well aware of some of the people I am talking about—he has been in consultation. Even Senator Madigan does not agree with the position of no mobile phone towers anywhere—I do not think I have misrepresented you there, Senator Madigan. Let us be clear: there are those who are walking around the country saying, 'We've got to get better mobile phone coverage, we need more towers.' What you have got in that corner—

I am talking specifically about the process of consultation, Minister.

It is going to be magic! We have got them on the one hand wanting to fan community concern about towers and the siting of towers, but they want to promise them better mobile phone coverage. Those opposite are complete frauds when it comes to this issue. Your policy—
