        It is a pleasure to take up the last two minutes and 21 seconds before question time. The Australian people need to be concerned with some of the actions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        in recent days. We find the Australian Labor Party have been cannibalising themselves and tearing themselves to pieces via the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
         ABC's
        </a>
        <i>
         The Killing Season
        </i>
        program, and might I say that we should continue to fund the ABC to produce such incisive demolitions of the culture of the modern Australian Labor Party. We understand that there are lobotomised zombies on the other side and we understand also that there are groups of individuals who really do believe the mantra that 'politics is show business for ugly people'. Hence they seek out the cameras and they chase them all across the land. They chase them from Sydney down to Melbourne and pose on park benches, pretending they are talking to someone.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an extraordinary decision and determination by those who consider themselves the brains trust of the modern Australian Labor Party. Whilst I am loath to name these individuals, I will identify Senator Dastyari as the man—he is known as 'Dasher'—who hunted that camera incessantly. I must contrast Senator Dastyari's involvement with the involvement of the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate, Senator Wong. I found it extraordinary over the course of these three nights that Senator Wong was always marching behind the leader who was being plotted against. It was quite uncanny. There was Senator Wong arm-in-arm with Mr Rudd and then arm-in-arm with Ms Gillard and then arm-in-arm with Mr Rudd again. This is the sort of thing that the leadership team of the Australian Labor Party does. The only thing they are good at is plotting against each other. I thank the Senate for the opportunity—
