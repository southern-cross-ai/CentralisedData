        My question is to Senator Brandis, the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Will the minister update the Senate on the government’s implementation of the landmark voluntary student unionism legislation and how it is guaranteeing freedom of association on Australia’s university campuses? Is the minister aware of any alternative views?

              Order! Senator Evans, the behaviour of senators on your side of the chamber is very poor. I would ask you to bring them to order because they do not take any notice of me.

                VSU
               </a>
               legislation was debated in this parliament, we heard all sorts of extraordinary claims. Senator Nettle, for example, in this place on 9  December 2005 said that students are ‘having their throats and voices ripped out’. Other senators opposite predicted that the experience of university life would be single-handedly destroyed. Notwithstanding those hysterical claims, today voluntary student activity is flourishing on campuses across the country, as I discovered last week when I visited
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Week" rel="nofollow">

               at the University of Melbourne.

              <p>
               One of the reasons why the introduction of VSU has proceeded so smoothly is the transitional funding provided by the government. Yesterday the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Ms Bishop, announced $58.2 million in funding for 37 projects under the

               on Regional University Campuses Program. Thirty-four of these projects are located on regional campuses. The projects supported by these grants provide students all around Australia with improved services and facilities which promote social interaction and good health. For instance,

               , Springfield and Toowoomba campuses. VSU has put $160 million into the pockets of Australian university students, who can now make choices about what services they support. Even more importantly, it has enabled them to live their student lives in conditions of freedom, not extortion—of choice, not compulsion.
