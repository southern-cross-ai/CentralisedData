        Well, well, well. What a wicked web we weave when we set out to deceive. Not only do we have a cost-of-living crisis in this country; we have an accountability and transparency crisis in this country as well. Just in the last month, we have seen the Albanese Labor government fail to disclose how many aged-care nurses are in aged-care centres, despite it being an election promise that they would have nurses in aged-care centres 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We see the Minister for Aged Care refuse to disclose how many nurses are actually in aged care.

        Then just last week we saw the Albanese Labor government vote against an inquiry into the social and economic impact of renewables on farmland and marine life. This side of the chamber, I know, cares very much about the environment. If Labor and the Greens were serious about caring for the environment, they would have an inquiry into the impact on the farmland and our precious sea life. Then we also tried to move a motion to actually get the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        to benchmark electricity prices, because what gets measured gets improved. Yet here we are again, in a cost-of-living crisis and an energy crisis, and the Labor government aren't interested in tracking energy prices. I wonder why. Is it because it's going to reveal that basically power prices didn't drop by $275, despite that being a Labor election promise?

        Then we had the dishonest statements from Minister Gallagher about what happened over the Brittany Higgins rape allegations. Ultimately, what happened there was weaponisation of something that should have remained a sensitive personal matter. Then we spent all last Friday night in the chamber trying to get some detail on the Voice. Did we get any detail? No—nada, zip, zilch, nada—because the Albanese Labor government doesn't know how to be honest with the people.
