        , Senator Cash. Minister, I note that your government's finally caved to public pressure and has brought a number of children and their families from Nauru to Australia. Can you confirm that either all or the overwhelming majority of those children who've been brought to Australia along with their families are currently being held in detention in Australia's onshore immigration detention network? How many children from Nauru do you currently have locked up in Australia?

Senator McKim sits there and yawns, colleagues, because he doesn't understand the reality of the policies that they have agreed with—policies that saw in excess of 50,000 people come to this country illegally. Senator McKim, the fundamental difference between those of us on the Liberal-Nationals side of politics and those on the left-wing side of politics is that we don't even want to see children go into detention in the first place, which means that we have tough border protection policies, because, Senator McKim, under the former Howard government—

           On the blindingly obvious point of order of direct relevance, the minister's more than halfway through the period of time allotted for her answer. She's not within a bull's roar of the question that I asked. I ask that you remind the minister of the question.

                   Minister, how many innocent children that have been brought from Nauru to Australia recently by your government have you got locked up in Australia's onshore immigration detention regime? Can you confirm that none of those children currently have access to any educational supports whatsoever?

You will be aware, as I have stated, that under this government we have made every possible effort to remove children from detention. From a peak of 1,992 children in detention under the government that you were part of, the former Labor-Greens government, the number of—

I'll ask this as a question: how many kids have you got locked up currently who have come from Nauru recently and are locked up in Australia's onshore immigration detention? What is the nature of the educational supports, if any, provided to those children? In fact, Minister, why are you holding any innocent children at all in our detention regime, and will you confirm that you will not send these kids or their families back to Nauru?

                             President, I'm unsure—this is a point of order, again, on direct relevance. I want to be clear. Is the minister saying that there are no children currently locked up in Australia's onshore immigration detention regime? I'd like her to clarify that, please—currently, as we stand here now.

                              , I've granted some latitude. It's not an opportunity to ask another question, most definitely. Senator McKim, the last part of your question there was fairly open ended—that is, the part that commenced with 'why'. The minister is being directly relevant to this supplementary question.
