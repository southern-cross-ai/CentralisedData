       <p>
        This morning we saw the Australian government vote down the rights of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_people" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous people
        </a>
        in this country. Yes, the Labor Party voted down our right to determine our own destiny. They voted down our right to decide on free, prior and informed consent. What a shameful day it is for people in this country to have this government, who say that they are our friends. However, when it comes to votes in here, it's an absolute disgrace. And you should all be ashamed of yourselves. You are not our friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we had a roundtable of people who are our friends. We had ambassadors from Zambia, Mexico and Palestine. Palestine turned up for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people in this country, today, for our rights—in the middle of what's going on over there and the genocide that's occurring, that this government still won't stand up and speak against. We also had people from Korea, El Salvador, Argentina and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Solomon Islands
        </a>
        . We had the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Human Rights Commission
        </a>
        there, whose recommendation was the implementation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Declaration" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Declaration
        </a>
        on the Rights of Indigenous People.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to stop relying on this colonial government. Labor, Liberal, the Nats—they're all the same, right? They all deny our rights as First People in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to build solidarity now, as a people in this country, because we are building international solidarity. And we'll continue to call out the ongoing genocide that the Labor Party have now signed up to.
