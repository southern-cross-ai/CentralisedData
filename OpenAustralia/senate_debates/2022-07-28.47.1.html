        As servants to the people of Queensland—or our states—and Australia, we have a sworn duty to tell the people the truth rather than what people would like to hear. Responding to fabricated narratives from predatory billionaires and their mouthpiece media is not honest government. Legitimising fairytales is not honest government. We live in an age where feelings are the new facts, when facts are conspiracy theories. Successive parliaments let this happen. We were elected to lead, not to follow. I always vote the facts, not the narrative, and I will continue to do so. Too many others in here do not. As a result, the next decade may be the worst in our history for freedom, opportunity and personal wealth.

        With a change of government we have a chance to choose what is right over what is expedient. Is Prime Minister Albanese capable of accepting that challenge? Time will tell. I sincerely wish the incoming government well and offer my support where that support is merited. Will the Nationals and Liberals learn from this election and return to their roots, representing farmers, families and aspirational Australians? Time will tell. I certainly hope so. Nothing will serve Australia better than making the next election an old-fashioned battle of ideas.

        In the last election, the lack of vision from both major parties left voters underwhelmed and disappointed. The focus groups fine-tuned bland policies into a bland sameness, leaving voters uninspired.

        is ready to begin the debate of ideas that will carry our beautiful nation and all within it forward to a future of freedom and abundance. We will be more focused on generating and endorsing the visionary ideas our nation needs for future prosperity, where families and personal responsibility are ascendant over collectivism and oppression, where Australians' interests are placed ahead of foreign globalist interests, where we have one world made of many countries, not one country made of many worlds. We have one flag. We are one community. We are one nation.
