                 Given the supposed commitment that Labor made to the Australian people prior to the last election that a Labor government would be open and transparent, which part of the principle of open and transparent are you following by withholding the Henry tax review since last year? Furthermore, considering Labor’s commitment to a principle of fiscal conservatism, what part of the principle of fiscal conservatism are you following by the leaking of sections of the Henry tax review and the uncertainty this is causing in the marketplace?

A question that is framed referring to a specific pre-election promise does not allow the minister to traverse every pre-election promise that Labor may have made. This was one about openness and transparency and that is what, under sessional orders, the minister needs to address. If he cannot—and we all think he cannot—he should sit down.

                               , on that point of order, what we have had from the opposition, in the taking of that point of order, is a traverse across a range of complaints that that opposition spokesperson may have. What this minister has been doing is answering the question that has been asked. The question was asked in a number of parts, including more than simply about transparency. So those opposite do not have the opportunity to reframe the question but should, if they are going to take a point of order, take a proper point of order and raise the particular issue. My submission is that there is no point of order being raised. The minister has been answering the question. The difficulty, from the opposition’s perspective, is that they want a specific answer to a specific question but they are not entitled to that. They are entitled to ask a question and have an answer that is relevant to the question asked.

I did draw the minister’s attention, on a previous point of order, to the question. I draw the minister’s attention again to the question and the fact that there are 12 seconds remaining to address the question.

But I am not going to speculate on what the Henry tax review contains. It would be utterly irresponsible to do so. I am not going to speculate upon what an independent tax review panel may or may not have recommended. It will be released, as the Treasurer has indicated, some time prior to the budget.

Does the government believe the existing personal service income laws are, to quote Senator Sherry ‘a threat to the integrity of the taxation system and a threat to the working conditions of employees’?

                                              I appreciate that Senator Joyce was not able to finish all of his question in his 30 seconds. I am not going to speculate. I am not going to simply accept the assertions that Senator Joyce has made about what he claims Senator Sherry has said and what he claims is a contradiction. I will look into this matter and, if there is anything to the claimed contradiction that Senator Joyce is seeking to put to me, I will get some further information and come back to the chamber. On the remainder of his question, let me be very clear—Senator Joyce—we will not be supporting your maternity leave big tax. We have no intention of putting up the prices of bread and petrol, as you are supporting.
