        Senator Scarr, I'm sure you're very good with your procedure, and I'm glad that you corrected the record. That's always helpful for a procedural debate of this kind in the Senate.

        But tonight I am here to talk about one of the most important investments that our government has made, and that is the one into Medicare. After a decade of denial, delay, rorts and scandal under the previous government, Australians finally have a government that is working for them. At the top of mind for our government are Australians, and we recognise the pressure they face under rising cost-of-living pressures. Our government understands that Australians are looking to us to take action, and we are committed to doing just that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week the Albanese Labor government implemented the largest investment in Medicare in its 40-year history, with the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive, which will make it so much easier for families to access a bulk-billing doctor. Our government wants to ensure that every Australian can easily find a bulk-billing doctor, and that's why we have taken action. By increasing payments to a bulk-billing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        —for example, in my hometown of Cairns it's increased by 46 per cent—it incentivises more GPs to offer bulk-billing services. Doctors' groups have called this a 'game-changer', and GPs have said that this will help them maintain and even shift back to bulk billing, meaning it will now be easier for around five million children and their families and seven million pensioners and other concession cardholders to access a doctor. Together, these patients account for three out of five visits to the GP.

        As a mum of a little girl myself, I understand the difficulties and anxiety that come with your kids getting sick, especially when it happens on a Saturday. In

        </a>
        , and regional Queensland more broadly, it can be especially challenging to find a doctor when you need one the most. Our investment is designed to address this problem, providing more bulk-billing options for families to access it when they need it, whether it's for urgent or routine checkups. Our $1.5 billion indexation boost to Medicare payments has also come into effect, meaning that we've delivered the largest increase to Medicare payments since

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Dutton
        </a>
        's year-long stint as health minister. His legacy of cuts to, and neglect of, Medicare put it in its worst shape in 40 years. When Peter Dutton was health minister he made it harder for Australians to see doctors, and no-one will forget when those opposite tried to destroy bulk billing altogether by proposing a $7 GP tax for every patient on every visit. Bulk billing is the beating heart of Medicare, and only Labor governments will defend it and invest in Medicare.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it isn't only Medicare that our government is investing in to help ease the cost-of-living pressures without adding to inflation. In fact, that's point 4 in our $23 billion 10-point plan to address cost-of-living pressures for our economy. On top of investing in Medicare, we are providing relief for electricity bills—a move that those opposite voted against. We're making child care more affordable, ensuring children get the best start in life and parents can return to work sooner or work more if they choose to do so. We're providing rent assistance increases. Medicines are more affordable and accessible. Income support payments have been boosted, and we're delivering fee-free

        training across the country, making an enormous difference for students who want to study but have never had the chance before.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government works tirelessly every day to alleviate the pressures that Australians are facing, even in the face of the Liberal and National parties, those opposite, and their staunch opposition to these changes. They voted against electricity bill relief. They have talked down fee-free TAFE, and they even opposed cheaper medicines. On this side of the chamber we are dedicated to making life better for all Australians, and we will continue to do so day in, day out. We are working hard for all Australians because we understand that cost-of-living pressures are top of mind for those households, and that's why they're top of mind for our government.
