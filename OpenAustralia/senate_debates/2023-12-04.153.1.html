        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. Since being elected, the Albanese Labor government has been commended for its careful and considered management of international trade relations. This praise has come from all corners, including from the agriculture, resources, manufacturing and service sectors, as well as from civil society and the Labor movement. Australian exporters in particular have benefited. They'd felt they were let down badly by the former Coalition government. Minister, please outline how the Albanese Labor government has been on the front foot to grow the Australian economy through its support of exports.

         I thank Senator Sterle for his question and his interest in trade, which so benefits his home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . The coalition's mismanagement of trading relationships and denial of climate change hurt our country's trade and investment relationships. But, in just 18 months since the Albanese government came to office, I'm pleased to advise that Australia's trade agenda is being progressed in a stable and positive way.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trade impediments affecting Australian exports to China, for instance, worth $20 billion have been removed or are on the pathway to removal. By any measure, this is a huge achievement which has been positively acknowledged by miners and farmers right across Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian exporters are benefiting from the Albanese government's hard work to finalise trade deals with the United Kingdom and India. Exports to the United Kingdom have increased significantly in the first four months of the agreement entering into force, including beef, which increased by around 320 per cent; honey, which increased by more than 170 per cent; and sheepmeat, which increased by 35 per cent. That's great news for farmers, including in your home state of Western Australia, Senator Sterle, and right across the country. And Australian exporters are taking advantage of the trade deal with India. Agricultural exports have grown by 86 per cent in the first seven months of 2023, and exports of manufactured goods, such as pharmaceuticals, wood and paper products, cosmetics and medical devices, have increased markedly. Trade is vitally important to Australian economic prosperity. More exports mean more and higher-paying jobs for Australian workers.

           Under the steady stewardship of the Albanese Labor government, many of the trade impediments imposed by China when the coalition government were in power have now been removed, which is particularly great news for the Australian mining and agriculture sectors. I know you can and I know you will, Minister, but please identify Australian exports to China that are directly benefiting from a mature hand on the trade policy tiller.

            Thank you, Senator Sterle, for those wonderful words. The Albanese Labor government is working hard to stabilise our relationship with China without compromising on what is important to Australians. Our efforts have led to positive trade developments, including the lifting of trade impediments affecting Australian coal, cotton, copper ores, logs, horticultural products, oats, hay and barley. Industry appreciates this hard work, with Viterra, a great company based in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia

            , acknowledging a 66,000-tonne barley shipment last month from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Lincoln" rel="nofollow">
             Port Lincoln
            </a>
            . I'll say that again: a 66,000-tonne barley shipment from Port Lincoln. And it would not have happened without this government's efforts. We've secured a pathway towards an early resolution of the wine dispute with China, and recent developments mean Tasmanian cherries and apples are headed back to China.

               Yes, I can, Senator Sterle. Our trade agreements with the United Kingdom and India are helping Australian exporters. A range of Australian exports to the United Kingdom are benefiting from lower
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
                UK
               </a>
               trade barriers, including beef, chocolate, confectionary, honey, sheepmeat, aluminium, motor vehicles and medical devices. Since the entry into force of the trade deal with India, around 85 per cent of Australian goods exported, by value, now enter India duty free. Australians are expected to save about $200 million annually in import duties paid on UK goods. Both the United Kingdom and India trade agreements are supporting Australian jobs and helping with cost-of-living pressures for Australian families. This government's trade agenda is delivering for all Australians.
