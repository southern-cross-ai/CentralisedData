        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. Can the minister confirm that the Morrison government placed its first order of Moderna in May, nine months after the Trump administration had placed its Moderna orders?

         [by video link] I don't have the specific date of when the first order of Moderna was placed, but the Australian government have gone through a process of full recognition and registration of all of the vaccines that we have utilised in the country. We've had the opportunity to take advantage of international experience with respect to the utilisation of the respective vaccines—

            On the point of order, you reminded the minister of the question. The minister addressed part of the question in his initial response, but you've called for the remaining information to be directly relevant. I believe information about ordering vaccines would, in that case, be directly relevant. He has directly addressed the first point you asked, rather than making a broader comment on vaccine strategy. I've let you remind him of it and I'll listen to his answer carefully.

             The Moderna vaccine forms a very important part of the overall vaccine strategy for this country. As I said to the chamber a moment ago, I don't have with me the specific date that the first order was placed. I'm happy to take that on notice and confirm that for the chamber. It forms a very important part of the overall vaccine strategy. The way that the government have managed the introduction of new vaccines into the country is to ensure that we've had full data available to the country via the TGA to ensure that the vaccines that we're utilising have high levels of efficacy and are safe. We, through the TGA, took just 23 days to approve the utilisation of the Moderna vaccine. We have used all our resources to ensure that we could have access to this vaccine as quickly as was safely possible so that it could be incorporated into the vaccine rollout program.

                [by video link] We have at all times worked with vaccine suppliers across the globe to ensure that we have capacity to meet the demands of the vaccination rollout for the Australian people. As I've just indicated to you, we approved the dataset for the Moderna vaccine in 23 days. We took the approach all through the rollout of the vaccines that we would utilise vaccines that were fully approved by the TGA and assessed through ATAGI so that we could guarantee to the Australian people that they were getting access to an efficacious and safe vaccine. We saw that as important for vaccine confidence in the Australian community. We have taken every step to ensure that Australians could be confident in the vaccines that they were taking. They went through the full and proper approval process.

                   [by video link] I won't apologise for ensuring that the vaccines that are available to Australians have been through a full and proper assessment and approval process. I won't apologise for that and nor would the government. It is important to ensure that there is vaccine confidence within the Australian community and that we have taken the approach that we have. Australians can be confident that the vaccines that are approved for use here in Australia have been fully approved by the TGA. They can have confidence in the TGA and ATAGI and Australians can be confident in taking up the vaccines that have been approved for the vaccine rollout in Australia. It's the Labor Party who continue to undermine the confidence of Australians with their negative attitude and negative tactics, attacking the vaccine rollout. The Labor Party should be ashamed of their approach to the vaccine rollout.
