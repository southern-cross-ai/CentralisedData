        That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senator Lambie today, relating to Chinese government donations to Australian political parties and Australia's free trade deal with China.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report from Australia's leading current affairs program,
        <i>

        , last night vindicated the warnings I have made about the dangers of money from China which is not properly scrutinised.
       </p>
       <p>
        The answers today and other comments from Liberal government representatives in response to my questions showed that there is no political will from the Turnbull Liberal government to fix the problem of corrupt Chinese government funds purchasing Australian property or Australian political party favours. There is only a will to cover up the truth, with predictable personal abuse and racist smears. I call for all Australian political parties to ban donations from money linked to China's communist government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only an independent senator would have asked questions demanding answers about corrupt political payments coming from China because the majority of Australia's main political parties—the Liberals, the Nationals and Labor—are receiving millions of dollars linked to the Chinese state or their associates.

        It is stunning that one of our most important national watchdogs, the Foreign Investment Review Board, deems the issue of dirty money to be outside its scope of responsibility! I will quote again from the Radio National report:

        's Global Financial Integrity says ignorance could cost Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Baker is being kind when he describes as ignorance the fact that no Australian agency is charged with identifying the true source of foreign funds streaming in from China. It is not ignorance. It is deliberate, it is seditious, it is criminal because no-one could be so stupid to stand by and allow the sell-off of Australia and the undermining of our national security and sovereignty to Chinese communist crooks. Unfortunately for Australia's future generations our food, water, energy, national security and workers' security are being compromised by the dirty deals the Liberal, National and Labor party members of this parliament are prepared to do with those who owe their wealth to the small group of elite people that rule the Chinese people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The answers given by the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis, only confirmed the very serious threat that the China free trade agreement poses to Australia—threats to national sovereignty, workers' job security and proper scrutiny of investment from a country which everyone knows is an international bully, thief and liar.
       </p>
       <p>
        Right now China is, firstly, flexing its military muscles in the international waters of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         South China Sea
        </a>
        and bullying international shipping. As I speak, the Americans are even risking an armed confrontation with China by sailing through contested international waters. Secondly, China is stealing every piece of data and intellectual property not nailed down in cyberspace. And I am yet to find one economic expert who is willing to say they trust any financial or economic figures to come out of mainland China. Clearly the Chinese government is an international bully, thief and liar and is a serious security threat to Australia and its allies.
       </p>
       <p>
        These latest media reports, combined with the evasive, predictable condescending replies to my questions, show that the Chinese government and its ruling communist elite have been caught out using their unlimited financial might to infiltrate Australians by stealth and attack our national security and sovereignty so that they can further their national interests and gradually impose their corrupt, totalitarian culture on us. As one veteran of the

        What the Chinese failed to do by the bullet and bomb in the 1950's, they're now doing with their cheque book's and political donations in 2015.
