         There is now an epic crisis of human rights in Syria. What we are witnessing is appalling and unabated human suffering. More than 7,500 civilians have been killed, tens of thousands of people have been arrested and 18,000 people are in arbitrary detention. They are

         figures. The evidence of widespread human rights abuses, possible war crimes and crimes against humanity is growing. According to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International" rel="nofollow">
          Amnesty International
         </a>
         , recent testimonies give insights into a system of detention and interrogation which appears intended primarily to degrade, humiliate and terrify its victims into silence. According to Amnesty's report, detainees have suffered 'prolonged and repeated beatings with various instruments including sticks, rifle butts and electric cables, as well as kicks'.

         Australia condemns utterly the violence in Homs that came to light on 11 March. The senseless massacre of women and children only adds to the depravity we have seen since the Assad regime turned its guns on the Syrian people a year ago. There are now reports, hard to believe, that Syrian authorities have placed landmines near the borders with Lebanon and Turkey. It is clear to all that this violence cannot continue.

It is too little to end the violence. It will not bring peace. In fact, talk of elections in the face of daily killings is laughable. Assad's earlier promise on political reform has not been honoured and the violence has only worsened. In the

           The first point to make is that we have been among the first in calling for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Assad" rel="nofollow">
            President Assad
           </a>
           to step down. He is a president without legitimacy, without credibility and with no future in Syria. We have repeatedly strengthened our sanctions against Syria's regime. Australia now lists 109 individuals and 40 entities connected to the violence in Syria subject to our sanctions. We will continue to consult our friends in the international community on placing additional pressure.

           on 29 April, 23 August, 2 December and 1 March. Overwhelmingly, the

            UN General Assembly

           has twice condemned the violence in Syria. Australia has co-sponsored both resolutions. Overwhelmingly, the Human Rights Council has expressed its outrage. Australia has co-sponsored all four resolutions on Syria.

              UN Security Council

             peace plan. The Security Council has again been considering a possible resolution on Syria. Differences within the council, however, remain wide. But every new outrage that comes to light in Syria must galvanise the council's will to exercise its international peace and security authority under the UN charter. Australia will continue to urge this.
