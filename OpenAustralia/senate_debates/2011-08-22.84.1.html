         I thank the senator for her question. Recently the Deputy Prime Minister and I were in Kiama, joined by Kiama Council's mayor, Sandra McCarthy, and their young citizen of the year, Melissa Tierney, as we went live for the trial into the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiama_Downs" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and Minnamurra region. Residents of the town have proved to be strong early adopters, with nearly 80 per cent consenting to have the fibre connected to their premises. Jeanette Burgess, a small business operator in Kiama, was interviewed by ABC South East New South Wales on August 12 about her experience with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN

         already. Ms Burgess said:

        <p class="italic">
         Everything is so much faster. For example, yesterday I had to download some software. Well it was just like that—faster than I would have been able to get the disc out, load it onto the drive and close the drawer.

         Ms Burgess also said, '

         Just two weeks ago today, with the Prime Minister and the mayor of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Moreland" rel="nofollow">
          City of Moreland
         </a>
         in Melbourne, we had the pleasure of turning on the most recent trial site of Brunswick in Melbourne. Brunswick is the first mainland city site to have the NBN turned on. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate the City of Moreland, which has worked proactively to produce communi­cation tools aimed at bridging the digital divide for those families who come from culturally and linguistically diverse back­grounds. Those opposite should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to oppose the NBN, for continuing to have a policy position of demolishing the NBN, because regional and rural Australia will be significant beneficiaries. Schooling, educa­tion, small business and farming com­munities will be the beneficiaries.

           I am delighted to inform the Senate today that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           Co. have announced the first five sites in rural Australia to be covered by the fixed wireless network. These five sites are in rural areas surrounding Geraldton, Darwin, Ballarat, Toowoomba and Tamworth. I expect Senator Joyce will be particularly delighted to know that in his home state of Queensland thousands of homes and businesses in rural areas around Toowoomba will have access to fast and affordable broadband, using the latest 4G technology, by the middle of next year.
          </p>
          <p>
           But that is not good enough for Senator Joyce. Senator Joyce is intent on moving to Armidale, because he does not want to contest against
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Windsor" rel="nofollow">
            Tony Windsor
           </a>
           —he actually wants to get on the NBN quickly! Not every Australian is going to get Barnaby's choice. You could also go to Mr Macfarlane in Groom; you could always have the courage of your convictions and challenge him, Senator Joyce.

             Recently, Mr Turnbull called for the abolition of cross-subsidies for the bush with regard to the delivery of broadband services. I wonder just how many people on the other side of the chamber know about this. But that is what he has called for. He also went on to call for the introduction of vouchers for families in the bush—that's right: vouchers!
            </p>
            <p>
             I am keen to find out whether the Nationals support treating rural and regional Australians as second-class citizens. It was not so many years ago that the Queensland Nationals, at one of their state conferences—August 2005, I believe—passed a resolution for the implementation of their five-pillar telecommunications policy. And if we look to No. 4, what does it call for? It calls for the maintenance of the price averaging basis for the cost of all new telecommunications and satellite internet connections to ensure that all Australians are charged the same basic price for maintenance and new conditions.
