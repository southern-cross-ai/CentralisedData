        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. I refer to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAC" rel="nofollow">
         CPAC
        </a>
        conference to be held in Australia next week, which will feature many right-wing extremists, including failed Ukip leadership candidate Raheem Kassam, who has campaigned against Muslim immigration, labelled the Koran fundamentally evil and attacked the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" rel="nofollow">

        for tranny pushing. Also joining Mr Kassam is guest speaker Senator Stoker. Does the minister believe it is appropriate for Senator Stoker to attend the event alongside Mr Kassam?

            The comments that Senator Keneally just quoted are disgraceful and highly objectionable and completely outrageous that, of course, I entirely abhor, and I'm sure anyone in this Senate chamber abhors. I don't think that that is a partisan position. Those are disgusting comments and I reject them. I reject them entirely and utterly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, having said that, I am not aware of this conference. I don't have the information in relation to this conference. I have already taken these matters on notice. I will just make a general point that, just because you are at an event somewhere, you're not expected to agree with everything that everybody says that is at the same event. Let me tell you, all of us have been at events in our electorates where we've come across people who have made highly objectionable comments.

               As Senator Keneally would know, or should know, the Australian government—that is, governments of either persuasion—does not comment on individual cases. What I would say is that all non-citizens entering Australia must meet and continue to meet the character requirements set out in the Migration Act 1958. There are strong provisions under the act to refuse or cancel a visa where a person is found not to be of good character. Any application lodged with the department about visitors who may hold controversial views will be considered, balancing any risk they may pose with Australia's well-established freedom of speech and freedom of beliefs. All visitors to Australia are expected to obey Australian laws and satisfy the character requirements of the Migration Act, but I do make the point again that, consistent with the appropriate practices of governments of both political persuasions, we do not comment on individual cases.
