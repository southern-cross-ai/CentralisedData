        On behalf of the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee’s report entitled
        <i>
         Report 101—Treaties tabled on 3 February 2009
        </i>
        . I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to have the tabling statement incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The statement read as follows—

         Mr President
        </a>
        , I present Report 101 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The report reviews two treaty actions:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Protection_and_Promotion_of_the_Diversity_of_Cultural_Expressions" rel="nofollow">
          Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions
         </a>
         ; and
        </li>
        <li>
         the Agreement between Australia and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community" rel="nofollow">
          European Community
         </a>
         on Trade in Wine.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In each case the Committee has supported the proposed treaties and recommended that binding treaty action be taken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>
         Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions
        </i>
        identifies the expression of culture by an individual or group as a tangible entity. The purpose of the Convention is to protect and promote the diverse range of these cultural expressions in an increasingly globalised world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Convention" rel="nofollow">
         The Convention
        </a>
        requires nations to undertake to assist the creation of cultural expressions, both domestically and abroad, through regulatory, legislative, financial and technical assistance, and to report to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        on these measures. The Convention is particularly concerned with securing cultural expressions that are under immediate threat and securing the cultural expressions of developing nations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the Committee is of the view that the Convention will help to develop and maintain Australia’s cultural industries and to protect Australia’s valuable cultural expressions.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        considers that accession to the Convention will demonstrate to the international community Australia’s commitment to cultural diversity and will expand Australia’s active engagement with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">
         UNESCO
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee also considered the
        <i>
         Agreement between Australia and the European Community on Trade in Wine
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, under the Agreement, Australia and the European Community are required to accept a range of wine labelling restrictions based on the production and geographical origin of the wine, and to recognise 16 previously unauthorised winemaking techniques.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Significantly, Australian fortified wine makers will be required to phase out the use of the terms ‘Port’ and ‘Sherry’ within 12 months of the entry into force of the Agreement, and the term ‘Tokay’ will have to be phased out within 10 years of the Agreement’s entry into force.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Wine" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Wine
        </a>
        and Brandy Corporation assured the Committee that, whilst there will be a cost to the industry in ceasing the use of these wine names, the agreement will secure the use of terms valuable to Australia’s fortified wine industry including ‘ruby’, ‘tawny’, ‘vintage’ and ‘cream’. Also, the Government has provided financial assistance to assist in the re-badging of wines. This project will see the term ‘Sherry’ replaced with the term ‘Apera’ within twelve months, and the term ‘Tokay’ replaced with ‘Topaque’ within 10 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In exchange for Australia’s acceptance of these labelling restrictions, the European Community will be required to permit the import and marketing of Australian wines produced using 16 winemaking techniques which previously lacked authorisation. Therefore Australian wine makers stand to gain greater access to European wine markets under the Agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the Committee considers that accession to the Agreement will strengthen trade between Australia and the European Community. The Committee is of the view that the Agreement will provide Australian winemakers with greater, and more secure, access to European wine markets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I thank the numerous agencies, individuals and organisations who assisted in the Committee’s inquiries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the report to the Senate.

        <p>
         I rise to support the motion to take note of
         <i>
          Report 101
         </i>
         of the treaties committee, in particular the detail within this report on the agreement between Australia and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community" rel="nofollow">
          European Community
         </a>
         on trade in wine. I will keep my remarks relatively brief, but it is important for the Senate to note the significance of this agreement, which provides some mutual recognition between Australia and the European Community around the trade in wine and the terms under which that trade occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to recognise that this agreement in fact has been under negotiation for a particularly long period. The initial agreement between Australia and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
          EU
         </a>
         on wine trade was reached and came into force in 1994, and the agreement that we report upon today has largely been under consideration and negotiation since that time. I pay tribute to the Australian officials who have been involved in the negotiations of this report, particularly my former colleagues at the Winemakers Federation of Australia and especially Mr Tony Battaglene—as well as officers of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Wine" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Wine
         </a>
         and Brandy Corporation, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         , and the department of agriculture for their work in representing Australia’s interests most passionately during these negotiations and securing a good outcome for the Australian wine industry in the very critical market of Europe, which is so important to us.
        </p>
        <p>
         This agreement will ensure that Australia’s leading winemaking practices and technologies are recognised and accepted in the European market, which will allow us to continue to grow that key export environment. We have, as one of the ‘new world’ wine countries, led the way in modern winemaking technologies and practices against the countries of the so-called ‘old world’ of the wine industry in Europe. Those groundbreaking technologies will now be recognised in Europe, allowing Australian product access to that key market. In return—there is of course a quid pro quo on this—Australia agrees to recognise exclusive access for a number of traditional European wine names. Those names, many of which have been familiar to Australian consumers over the years, such as champagne, burgundy, sherry and tokay, will gradually be phased out. Some, of course, have been phasing out of existence for a good period already. For example, the Australian industry has largely left the name champagne behind already; marketing its product most effectively as sparkling wine throughout Australia and the rest of the world. The other names will gradually be replaced, allowing Australian wines to stand on their own merits rather than attempting to take the names of their European counterparts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has already made this transition extremely successfully over the years, ensuring that our wine is branded on an individual basis—recognising the winemaker and winery involved, the geographical indication involved, the region from which it stems, and ensuring that each wine has its unique, recognisable and understandable brand for the consumer. This stands in contrast to the more convoluted recognition of wines that has existed in Europe over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
         So this is indeed a welcome step to ensure that Australia has access to that market. The Australian industry, I believe, is well placed to make this transition, having been doing so already for a number of years now. I recognise that the previous government provided some funding to assist in the transition, particularly around names like tokay and muscat, ensuring that those producers—especially, Mr Acting Deputy President McGauran, in your home state of Victoria, around the Rutherglen region and elsewhere—have the support to shift and change the recognition of their very historic products, like tokay, to new names that will be recognised and understood by consumers. These are important changes. I urge the new government to continue their support for the industry in ensuring those changes are appropriately applied and understood by consumers so as not to disadvantage the wineries of Rutherglen or anywhere else around Australia. I particularly congratulate those parties involved in the negotiation of this treaty. I am pleased that the treaties committee in its report to the parliament today has endorsed it.
