           </dt>
           <dd>
            the initial payment in effect represents a new policy decision and therefore should be in Appropriation Bill (No. 2); and

            (b)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            subsequent payments represent a continuing government activity of supporting the international organisation and therefore represent an ordinary annual service and should be in Appropriation Bill (No. 1).

          </dl>
         </dd>
         <dt>

       <p>
        Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. We have just been given notice of a motion, the full terms of which have been given to the Clerk, but there has been no indication to the Senate as to what the motion is about. I would ask leave of the Senate for the honourable senator to indicate to the Senate what the motion is about.

         I am not in a position to make any senator do anything, Senator Bob Brown. I can inform you that it will be circulated very shortly.
