        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. I refer the minister to a statement made by the Tasmanian Labor leader,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_White" rel="nofollow">
         Rebecca White
        </a>
        . It says:

       <p class="italic">
        We will make redevelopments at our major hospitals our highest priority for Federal Government funding in our first term, working with them to deliver these projects …
       </p>
       <p>
        Funding for these health infrastructure promises would likely run into the hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. Have any requests been received for these announcements?

         I thank Senator Askew for the question on the important issue of health. It's nice to get a question on such a significant matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to announcements made by the Labor opposition in Tasmania, I'm not specifically aware of the announcement you mentioned, but we've made no secret of wanting to work with state and territory governments on delivery of hospital services improvements, and obviously there are discussions all the time with states and territories about hospital infrastructure. It was a key decision point and discussion point at National Cabinet late last year about the hospital reform agreement that's up for negotiation and the pressure that's on state and territory governments around that, so I don't think it's any secret that health systems around the country are under pressure. State and territory governments are finding it difficult to manage some of those pressures and are wanting assistance from the Commonwealth, which we're happy to engage in with the national health—

          A point of order on direct relevance: the minister was asked about whether a request was received. We've talked generally about health, but I haven't heard her say yet whether a request has been received from the Labor leader or not.

            The Albanese government looks forward to working with the government of Tasmania, pending the outcome of the election that's underway, when that occurs. We will work together on health. We will work together on health infrastructure. We will work together on Medicare urgent care clinics. We will work together on workforce, which has been an issue in Tasmania—access to specialists, particularly access to primary care, to

            s, to new models of care. These are all things that the minister for health will work on with whoever is the health minister.

           <p>
            If there are particular policies that have been made by either side through the election campaign, the Commonwealth remains open and prepared to engage on all of those matters should they improve health service delivery in Tasmania.

               We have discussions, as I said, with the opposition and government of Tasmania about pressing priorities. I have had discussions with Ms White, I have certainly had them around health, when I have had the opportunity to meet with her. I know the health minister works across the parliament in Tasmania on that, and I would think it's highly unusual that a Labor leader in any state or territory or in the federal jurisdiction would not go to the people of their state with a comprehensive policy around health, hospital infrastructure and improving services. We know they've been under pressure in Tasmania and, from what I've seen of the campaign, health is a critical issue, so I don't think it's any surprise that commitments are being made about that.

                  As I said in my previous answers, we will work with the government of the day in Tasmania to continue to improve access to health services for the people of Tasmania. It is not unusual that parties go through election campaigns and make commitments and, when those commitments are endorsed and governments are elected, the Commonwealth will work with them. It is of course in stark contrast to what happened when the coalition was in power, when it went around cutting the hospital agreements—when they cut $50 billion under Peter Dutton's leadership. They cut money out. I was a territory leader then, and I remember what happened. We are prepared to invest. We are prepared to work with the Labor Party if they win government in Tasmania, just as we will if the current government remains in place. Health services are an important issue for any election campaign, and we look forward to working with either party, pending the outcome.
