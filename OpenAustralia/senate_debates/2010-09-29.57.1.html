           I may have missed my opportunity but I note that the reporting date is 25 October. I am concerned that that is the first available day after the estimates week and the committee may find that having time to meet and report on the same day may not be possible. I was wondering whether Senator Brown might want to move the reporting date to Wednesday which at least allows the committee to meet on the Monday and report by the Wednesday giving an opportunity for people to be able to discuss the issue in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
            Procedure Committee
           </a>
           and provide a report. I did not want to slow it down any further having regard to the intent that Senator Brown has with this issue.
