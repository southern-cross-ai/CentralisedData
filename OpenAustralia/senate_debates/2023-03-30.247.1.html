        I rise with two good-news stories. In the first instance, I'd like to pay tribute to my dear friends in the Liberian Association of Queensland, who held a very successful 'Sharing love through diversity' dinner in my home state of Queensland last Saturday night. It was a deep and great honour to attend that dinner. Also in attendance were my good friend Beny Bol, who is the President of the Queensland African Communities Council; Christine Castley, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Multicultural Australia; and Uncle Barry Watson, an elder of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people, who spoke about how close he'd become to members of the Liberian community, including young Liberian members who came here originally as refugees. Also in attendance were two delightful primary school aged boys, Zeka and Elijah, who brought great spirit and made a great contribution to the evening. I was particularly impressed with Zeka's oratory skills. He was actually referred to by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC" rel="nofollow">
         MC
        </a>
        as 'Baby Obama'. Zeka, you've got a great future, I'm sure. It was just delightful to see your interaction with your dear friend Elijah.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also in attendance were the enchanting elephant dancers from the Acholi tribe of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan" rel="nofollow">
         South Sudan
        </a>
        , who attended to put on a dance performance. I also call out the two members of that group: Santa Benon Ayulu and Concy Layet. Concy is actually the daughter of Santa, and I know Concy well from her work as the manager of the African centre in Moorooka, referred to as the African Village. I really do commend Concy on the great work she does in the community as a mentor at the African Youth Support Council. From my perspective, Concy, you and your mother, Santa, represent the very best of Australian values.
       </p>
       <p>
        My second good-news story is to congratulate Komatsu in relation to its partnership with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Endeavour Foundation
        </a>
        . Komatsu identified an issue with respect to the yellow plastic canisters it uses to engage in engine oil testing. They use something like 220,000 of these canisters every year, and, if they were not recycled, they would contribute approximately ten tonnes of landfill each year. So what Komatsu did was enter into an arrangement with the Endeavour Foundation, which provides great opportunities to disabled people in our community. Working together with the Endeavour Foundation, those engine oil testing canisters are being recycled and reused instead of going into landfill, and that is extremely commendable. I say this to the Endeavour Foundation first: thank you so much for all the work you do in providing opportunities for disabled Australians in meaningful work and employment. I've seen firsthand what a positive contribution you make to our society.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, I deeply congratulate Komatsu. I'm not sure that many members in the chamber know this—I didn't know this before looking into it—but Komatsu was founded by Meitaro Takeuchi. Excuse me for my pronunciation. He was the owner of a copper mine in Japan which closed in 1920. He was concerned about the impact on the local community of that copper mine closing, so he moved to diversify his business. That's how Komatsu was started, to provide employment opportunities for people in regional Japan, an issue which we've been talking about this week. I say to the leadership of Komatsu: I think the initiative Komatsu has taken with the Endeavour Foundation fits with the values of your founder, Mr Meitaro Takeuchi. I compliment you on it. It is noted by the Senate chamber in this country, it is appreciated, it is greatly admired, and it is a shining example, I think, of what it means to be a good corporate citizen.
