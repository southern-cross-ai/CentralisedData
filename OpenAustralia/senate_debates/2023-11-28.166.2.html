          It has been another big year of major reform—18 months, in fact, of historic reforms to address the cost of living and to ease pressure on family budgets. The Albanese government is rightly proud of these achievements and its commitment to collectivism, progress and shared prosperity. While those opposite had almost 10 years in government and achieved very, very little, we had a plan coming into government. We are proudly implementing this plan because we know that our plan will directly impact on and make Australians' lives better. When we are in government, we choose to be a government that will deliver for the Australian people. We're not here for the power, as are those on the other side. We understand that's in their
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
           DNA
          </a>
          ; they believe that they're the rightful government in this country. But when we get into government, we want to ensure that we change Australians' lives for the better.
         </p>
         <p>
          We acknowledge that there are rising cost-of-living pressures on budgets around Australia. I know only too well the impact that it's having on Tasmanians—the cost of food, petrol, mortgages and rents. But the Albanese government is 100 per cent focused on addressing those cost hikes and ensuring that the economy stabilises sooner rather than later through our 10-point plan to deliver around $23 billion of support targeted to where it's needed most. There are things like electricity bill relief, cheaper child care, increased rent assistance, more Medicare bulk-billing, cheaper medicines, boosting income support payments, fee-free

          training, building more affordable homes, expanding paid parental leave, getting more people into jobs and getting wages moving again. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
           Reserve Bank
          </a>
          will continue to make independent decisions about interest rates, while the government will curb inflation challenges through a combination of budget restraints, investment to lift capacity in our economy and targeted cost-of-living relief to help ease inflation within our economy.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a government, we have to be prepared to take the hard decisions. But the federal Labor government has always been driven consistently by nation-building reforms—such as Medicare, compulsory superannuation, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
           NDIS
          </a>
          and paid domestic and family violence leave. We have continued that journey in this term of government thus far. As Chifley said, it's about 'bringing something better to the people'—the light on the hill. Improving the lives of Australians is alive and well in this country. We want to make our country fairer and stronger so that every Australian has the opportunity to do well in life, to live their lives to the fullest potential. We want them to have access to better education and access to a doctor when they need one.
         </p>
         <p>
          I know the benefits that Tasmanians have had through the implementation of three Medicare Urgent Care Clinics already. Those are operational, and the fourth one has just been announced. We're doing that because it shouldn't be your credit card that dictates when you can see a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
           GP
          </a>
          , it should be your Medicare card. That's why Labor will always protect Medicare and it's why we've invested in our GPs and invested to ensure that there are cheaper medications. We took the strong and needed decision to have 60-day dispensing so that people can get their medications when they need them and it's more affordable for them.
         </p>
         <p>
          We've invested in childcare reforms, saving people in my home state of Tasmania $2,000 a year; energy bill relief; and a transition to invest in renewable energy. These are the commitments that will see real change in this country. We're investing in 30,000 social and affordable homes, greater investment in Australian manufacturing and the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission—a big ticket item that Australians want to see. But what did those people on the other side do when they were in government for 10 years? Nothing. Nothing at all.
         </p>
         <p>
          I remember when the Prime Minister was first elected. Mr
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese" rel="nofollow">
           Anthony Albanese
          </a>
          gave a speech when he became Prime Minister. He said that, at the end of the day, when he leaves this place and he is sitting on the porch, he wants to reflect and be able to say he didn't leave anything on the field. That's the motivation, and that's the commitment that the Albanese Labor government makes to all Australians. We will do our best for you each and every day because that's what we believe we're here to do.
