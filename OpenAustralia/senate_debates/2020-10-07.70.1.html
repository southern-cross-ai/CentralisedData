         At the outset, can I say Australia remains deeply concerned by reports of enforced disappearances, mass detention, forced labour and pervasive surveillance of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, and by restriction of freedom of religion and belief in China. These concerns are reflected across the parliament and the Australian community; I note Senator Abetz's contribution to the parliament during senators' statements earlier today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minister Payne has clearly conveyed the Australian government's concerns about the situation in Xinjiang to China, including during her last three meetings with State Councillor Wang Yi and during her address to the

         I have some figures on support for winter sports. I will note that all of the funding allocations made to winter sports are available publicly on the Sport Australia website. The last financial year figures that I have for high-performance allocations are for the Olympic Winter Institute, of $5.25 million. Skiing and snowboarding received $1.61 million for able-body sport, and there was $1.23 million for parasports. Those numbers go beyond the

            In relation to that particular matter I note the comments of Foreign Secretary Raab in recent days, where he indicated that it was his instinct to separate sport from diplomacy. I share those instincts, but I do not step back from the comments that I made in response to the senator's primary question and neither, I think, does anybody in the parliament. We have a range of avenues to advocate strongly for human rights in China, including directly with China and in multilateral forums. We will continue to raise our concerns, as we've done consistently through the joint statement with 38 other countries to raise concerns about human rights in
