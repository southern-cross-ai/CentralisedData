         I thank Senator Hume for her question and her concern about the very serious issue of bullying, and bullying in schools in particular. Of course, schoolyard bullying is as old as schoolyards themselves. But, of course, we see advances in relation to the problems of schoolyard bullying as a result of the advent of the internet and the reality that bullying in schools can now, tragically, follow children home in a whole variety of ways, into their lounge rooms or into their bedrooms, and follow them 24 hours a day.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why it's so important that last Friday, 16 March we held the eighth national day against bullying and violence. The Turnbull government has consistently supported this and has committed further support to ensure the continuance of this day into the future. We are very pleased that there was record participation last Friday, with almost two million Australian school students—and I acknowledge the many school students who are in the gallery today, from the national constitutional convention, who I know would acknowledge that this is a critically important issue. Nearly two million Australian students took part in the national day across nearly 4,600 schools. These numbers, importantly, were more than double last year's participation level. It demonstrates the effectiveness of our call to action to Australian schools to do more to engage, and to talk more about this important issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Hume, in your home state—and yours as well,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , through you—more than 315,000 students across 702 schools participated in this day. It's a day in which we acknowledge that there is no single silver bullet, but it allows school communities, encompassing parents and students, principals and teachers, to all come together to address the multifaceted approaches to raise awareness, to make sure that they are aware of the resources available to talk about bullying and to combat bullying, and where, of course, to take concerns and seek help when required. It was very important, and I was delighted to join schools—

They talked about their superpower to stop bullying, and how it is that we can tell people—tell an adult; tell a teacher; tell a parent; tell your peers in your school community; talk to one another; talk to those who are engaged in the bullying, if you possibly can—to help combat these problems. Of course, this was an issue discussed by chief ministers at the last

                 The work of the eSafety Commissioner established by the coalition government is critical, not just for students or for teachers and schools but also for parents to be able to access appropriate resources. Last Friday, the eSafety Commissioner, along with 13 wellbeing groups, issued a clear call to action: to encourage people to talk about bullying and violence with their children as early as possible; to make sure they seek help, and encourage children to reach out as soon as issues arise; and to ensure that there is a high level of awareness about what to do and how to get help. Of course, it is also underpinned by the Turnbull government's decisions and actions to provide greater support to youth mental health initiatives, such as headspace, to ensure that there is ongoing assistance available to students who need it. All up, this is critically important in terms of awareness: action in schools; action by parents; awareness of children about how to best stop bullying; how to create a culture of inclusion; but also, where bullying does occur, how to reach help as quickly and effectively as possible.
