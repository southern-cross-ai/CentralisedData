         This is Senator Steele-John's portfolio area. He has had a number of concerns raised with him from constituents about some of the provisions in this bill and he wants to refer it to committee. We know it's on the red for today, and I understand that's one of the reasons why the government isn't keen for this to go to committee. But Senator Steele-John feels very strongly that this should have a relatively short inquiry, given the issues that are involved.

          I can appreciate Senator Siewert's concerns, but the opposition is concerned that there not be any further delay in relation to these measures. We had agreed with the government to facilitate as quickly as possible bringing in better arrangements to manage these issues. Unfortunately, this could have been referred back in December, and, had it occurred back then, we might've been in a position to address it in more detail. But I'm sure also, in relation to the Greens senator dealing with this matter, there have been many investigations addressing these very serious issues that have informed this legislation now. In the absence of any particular or specific new matters to justify anything that will cause further delay, the opposition is opposed to this motion being amended.
