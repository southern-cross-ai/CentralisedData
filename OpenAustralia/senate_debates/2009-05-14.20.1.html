         I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to the motion which has just been negatived.

         Leave granted.
        </p>
        <p>
         I just want to state the case for the opposition. We oppose this motion on the basis that we will not support the federal parliament instructing state parliaments in any matter in relation to their jurisdiction and how they run their finances and administration. We fully support governments conducting their businesses efficiently to ensure the maximum return for their respective electors but in this place we cannot instruct another level of government on how to operate.

           Lake Pedder

          </a>
          and it has served the state well. We heard the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
           Premier of Tasmania
          </a>
          just last night saying that 45 per cent of Tasmania is, to quote him, ‘locked up’. The fact is that if you have 45 per cent of any state under protection then you absolutely, logically and sensibly, will have a protection agency to deal with the half a million to one million visitors a year coming to Tasmania because of that superb natural asset. It is a far bigger job creator than the destruction of forests in Tasmania. It is absolutely incredible and an indictment of the Labor government in Tasmania that they are abolishing the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Environment" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Environment
          </a>
          , Parks, Heritage and the Arts. It is almost as if there is a hate for the beauty of Tasmania abroad amongst some of the old thinkers in the Labor Party. Far from instructing, as Senator Perry said, the Tasmanian government to do anything, this Senate has a responsibility, no less than that of the Labor government in Tasmania, to look after
