        NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE AND THE PARLIAMENTARY BUDGET OFFICE
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Each year the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is required by legislation to consider the draft budget estimates for the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Australian National Audit Office, and make recommendations to both
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houses_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Houses of Parliament
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I rise today to fulfil this requirement and make a statement on whether the committee considers that the proposed funding for these offices is sufficient to carry out their respective mandates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With regard to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the committee has been informed that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBO" rel="nofollow">
         PBO
        </a>
        is not seeking supplementation for 2016-17 beyond the expected additional departmental appropriation of $6.9 million. The PBO plans to supplement these funds with a drawdown of approximately $1.2 million from their special appropriation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst noting that the PBO has seen a substantial increase in its workload over the course of the current financial year, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Budget_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Budget Officer
        </a>
        has advised the committee that the PBO's resources are adequate to meet its liabilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee endorses the proposed 2016-17 budget for the PBO, and commends the PBO for its high quality work in support of parliamentarians and the public.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With regard to the Australian National Audit Office, the committee has been informed that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
         ANAO
        </a>
        is not seeking supplementation for 2016-17 beyond the anticipated total revenue from government of $74 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Auditor-General has advised the committee that the ANAO's resources are adequate for 2016-17, and that he anticipates completing approximately 48 performance audits over the period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act's focus on enhanced performance measurement and reporting highlights the importance of ANAO's performance audits. Over the financial year, the Auditor-General plans to exercise the full range of powers available to him under legislation by commencing audits of the Annual Performance
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement" rel="nofollow">
         Statement
        </a>
        s of Commonwealth entities, as well as potentially conducting performance audits of Commonwealth partners and government business enterprises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee endorses the proposed budget for the ANAO in 2016-17 and commends the ANAO for its high quality work and focus on performance frameworks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In conclusion, the committee will continue to closely monitor the work programs and draft budget estimates of the PBO and ANAO. As independent authorities, the PBO and ANAO need to be sufficiently funded to fulfil their legislative requirements and adequately support the parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee appreciates the efforts of both the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Auditor-General in maintaining strong working relationships with the parliament, and particularly with this committee. They have made themselves available for regular briefings and provided invaluable advice to the committee on a variety of matters. The committee looks forward to continuing these productive relationships.
