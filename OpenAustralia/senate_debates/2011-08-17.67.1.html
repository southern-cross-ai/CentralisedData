         I thank the senator for her question and I can assure Senator Abetz I will not be mentioning him six times; he is not that relevant. It is an important question because Labor have delivered on our promise to consign the coalition's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         legislation to the dustbin of history and to put in place the Fair Work Act. That act ensures that workplaces are underpinned by fairness and delivers flexibility and opportunities for employers and employees.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all know what Work Choices meant for hardworking Australians. Under that legislation workers could be forced to sign a take it or leave it
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
          AWA
         </a>
         which stripped away basic entitlements without compensation and without the oversight of an independent umpire. The facts speak for themselves. Under Work Choices 64 per cent of AWAs cut annual leave loading and 63 per cent reduced penalty rates for ordinary working people. Women workers were particularly badly hit by those changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         What the Liberal Party do not understand is that millions of Australian families rely on penalty rates to help meet their everyday costs. Those penalty rates are part of their weekly budgets and help pay for the food, the mortgage and the standard of living that they enjoy.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
          The Liberal Party
         </a>
         's intent to undermine penalty rates is fundamentally an attack on the wages and conditions of Australian families. They compensate people for working antisocial hours, but we have put in place the new better off overall test for enterprise agreements which ensures that those conditions are protected. Penalty rates are an important part of the standard of living of millions of Australians and they need to be supported.

           s that stripped away wages and conditions such as penalty rates. By introducing the Fair Work Act we have established a fair safety net for employees, one part being the modern industry awards. These awards enshrine entitlements tailored to the specific needs of workers in businesses in a particular industry. Importantly, these modern awards contain entitlements like penalty rates for workers who spend time working on week­ends, public holidays or doing shiftwork.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are proud that our system supports fair compensation for those people working unsociable hours. The Fair Work Act introduced a new better off overall test for new enterprise agreements. That test ensures that Australian workers have their entitle­ments, including penalty rates, protected. We protect their standard of living through our industrial relations legislation.
