       <p>
        Tonight I want to pay tribute to a father, grandfather and husband, a long-time contributor to this nation's political landscape and a friend of mine, David Lawrence Whitrow. Sadly, David passed away just two months ago, less than six months after he retired from 20 years of service as a staff member to various members of parliament. I want to pay my respects to the long service that David gave to our country and offer my sincere condolences to David's family.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure most members of parliament appreciate the arduous efforts of their staff and that those staff often do not get the credit they deserve. David was the template for an effective, hardworking and supportive leader among the staff that make this parliament work. If there was one word to sum up what David brought to our team it would be that David was unflappable. It would not matter the situation or the crisis, David would be calm, he would be even-handed and he would be fair. I often wondered if it was David's habit to sneak off for the odd cigarette that gave him this calmness and even-handedness. When I started working here, I soon took up that evil habit myself again but soon realised that it was not the cigarettes that helped; it must have been something else. I think it was David's dry sense of humour that kept him sane in this place; it is something that I think we all need from time to time.
       </p>
       <p>
        In some senses David was my first boss. I came here to work for Senator Barnaby Joyce, but, at the time, David was the Chief of Staff to the Leader of the Nationals,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Truss" rel="nofollow">
         Warren Truss
        </a>
        . I know it is hard to believe but sometimes my boss, Barnaby, would get himself into the odd scrape. He would get into a bit of trouble. He would say things in slightly the wrong way or go out on a topic where angels feared to tread. I would get angry and urgent phone calls from some shadow ministerial offices. But David's rebukes would always be subtle: 'He could have expressed that better' or some such. Sometimes a velvet glove has more impact than an iron fist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our families sacrifice so much so that we can pursue careers in this place. As

        </a>
        once eloquently put it: we are the volunteers but our families are the conscripts. After volunteering more than most, the veterans of political careers look forward to retirement at home, with their families. David had earned that rest. He deserved that respite, and his family were due much more time to enjoy his company than has tragically occurred. David was a devoted and loving husband to his wife, Margie, and was similarly devoted to his family—his brother, John, and his wife, Deidre; son, James and his wife, Alex; son, Justin; daughter, Melissa, and her husband, Damien, and their children, Sadie and Charlie, who had David as their wonderful 'Grandpa'. My sincerest condolences go to them all.
       </p>
       <p>
        David was born in Adelaide. His first job around politics was working for the Australian Mining Industry Council, and he was head of the Tasmanian Chamber of Mines—an industry that I now have the honour of representing. I am always astounded that, 20 years after he left working for the mining industry, there are still people who remind me of his character and of his legacy to the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        David loved a punt. He had an uncanny ability to leave a casino or other gaming establishment well in front—much to the chagrin of his fellow gamblers, who would often leave with nothing. He was an avid golfer and gardener. He received a Hole in One award at the Federal Golf Club in 2012. I hope I might get that one day, but I probably never will. He took a great interest in the lives of his children and grandchildren. He was a master at barbequing. He and Margie put on the best backyard barbeques in Canberra. He loved walks with Molly, his golden retriever. He loved to travel. He also loved working for Warren Truss, who was more than a boss to David. He was a loyal friend and confidant. I know Warren and Lyn were deeply saddened with the loss of David. Warren gave a great eulogy at David's funeral a couple of months ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was respected by all sides of politics, and close to half the cabinet attended his funeral. He is missed keenly by many of us in this place. It was a loss to us all earlier this year when he retired and was no longer just down the corridor or in the courtyard sneaking 'another'. Now that he is not on the phone or just around the corner, his loss is felt so much more deeply.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was a mentor to many within the National Party. Many staff who have risen to lead offices as chiefs of staff had often previously worked for David or would call on him for advice. He was a humble but passionate man who fought hard for National Party values and worked behind the scenes to achieve significant outcomes. He always had an open-door policy, and, despite his calm, kind and welcoming manner, he was very much a warrior for the coalition and held pivotal roles in five federal election campaigns at coalition headquarters. He was chief of staff to the former Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Warwick Parer, and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        , the Hon. Wilson Tuckey MP—someone else who used to get into the odd scrape.
       </p>
       <p>
        As chief of staff to the Deputy Prime Minister, David was a key part of the Nationals and coalition leadership teams. He worked on many high-level government committees, including the Expenditure Review Committee. He was part of the daily morning leadership conferences and held a key position on the Staff Selection Committee. Being on the budget committee meant that he was at the heart of how the government approached tough economic decisions, and his sphere of influence was not confined to the areas within only the National Party ministers' portfolio responsibilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        He worked seamlessly with three federal presidents and two federal directors, always offering frank and sound advice and his full support, without seeking any particular recognition for himself. David was presented posthumously with a Nats Wombat at his funeral. During election campaigns, David held court on infrastructure issues, particularly funding for roads, highways, bridges, range crossings, railway corridors and decisions on intermodal hubs and dams. He worked closely with his coalition partners. As far as David was concerned, there were no boundaries between the Nationals and the Liberals, especially when it came to making tough decisions—everyone owned those tough decisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of his greatest achievements would often never be attributed to his behind-the-scenes work—whether it be on aviation security post September 11; combatting rising petrol prices; working on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Darling_Basin" rel="nofollow">

        agreement; being the architect for assistance to so many packages for the agriculture sector, with various packages for the sugar and dairy industries and, more recently, drought assistance policies at the height of Australia's worst-ever drought. He found money for our national highway in times when there was no money to spare. And he persisted with trade agreements at times when there was not much light at the end of the tunnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was much of this behind-the-scenes work where David was at his best. He valued the relationship governments need to have with their departments and industry, and he worked constantly to build confidence, trust and respect. He had close working relationships with departmental secretaries and their deputies. He also worked closely with the chief financial officers of government departments to get the most out of their budgets, especially in the months leading into the budget when many of the decisions are made. I could certainly use some of his talents now.
       </p>
       <p>
        David retired earlier this year in March. I spoke to him only a few months ago to get some advice myself as I put a ministerial office together. He was clearly enjoying his time away from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and was planning a major holiday with his wife. I counted David as a close friend. I would seek his advice and trusted it. His life was tragically cut too short but then his achievements and legacy are long.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian political landscape is much less greener for the loss of David Whitrow. We are indebted to him for his contribution and service. He will remain an example to all staff in this place. He lived up to those eternal worlds from

        . He kept his head while other lost theirs, he did not deal in lies or give away to hating. He walked with kings but kept the common touch. He was a man, and a man worth following. Vale David Lawrence Whitlow.
