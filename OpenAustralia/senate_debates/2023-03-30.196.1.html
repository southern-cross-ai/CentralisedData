        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, last week in your absence Minister Farrell was asked to name anywhere in Australia where electricity prices had gone down since the Albanese government was elected. Minister Farrell did not name anywhere but did say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I do not follow power prices closely enough to be able to answer the question.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister Wong, do you follow electricity prices more closely than Minister Farrell?

          I'll take the interjection from Senator Birmingham. I always think it's a very dangerous thing when politicians try to compete about these things—about being in touch, that is—because we're all politicians, aren't we? But we understand very acutely the cost-of-living pressures facing Australian families. Obviously, for a whole range of reasons, inflation has driven increases in costs. People are feeling it at the supermarket and they're feeling it in terms of utilities and services. That is why those of us on this side, along with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Greens
          </a>
          and others, voted for price relief for Australian families.
         </p>
         <p>
          Every time someone from the other side comes in here and tells us about energy price relief, let's remember they voted against energy price relief. That is what the coalition did. You voted against a price cap for coal and gas. You voted against $3 billion in targeted bill relief for businesses and households most in need. You voted against a 12-month price cap on uncontracted gas at $12 a gigajoule and a 12-month price ceiling on domestic coal for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          and Queensland. And then you have the gall to come in here and talk about who's out of touch. No-one who is in touch with Australian families and what is happening on the cost of living out there would have had the temerity to come into this chamber and vote against price relief for Australian families. If you want to talk about who's not in touch, have a look in the mirror, Senator Cash.

             Well, I know that everywhere in Australia would have had higher prices if you were in government. That's what we do know, and we know that prices have risen by less than they would have as a result of the government's policy which you voted against.

                   That's what Mr Taylor did. Well, we on this side understand what families are facing and we're trying to do something about it.

                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMO" rel="nofollow">
                         DMO
                        </a>
                        for 2023-24. What that showed—and this is what's happening to energy prices—is the DMO will rise up to 22 per cent for households and up to 25.4 per cent for businesses. That is a substantial increase. But what it also showed is without the coal and gas price caps, that you voted against, the price increase would have been 51 per cent and 53 per cent—51 per cent and 53 per cent!
