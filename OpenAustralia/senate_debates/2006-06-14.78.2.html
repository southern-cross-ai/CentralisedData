       <p class="italic">
        Defence submitted that the purpose of the proposed works is to provide facilities at HMAS
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        for the berthing and effective operation of the new ARMIDALE Class Patrol Boats; and to refurbish and reinvest in ageing base infrastructure. This will be achieved by the acquisition of increased berthing access at the adjacent commercial wharf; and the refurbishment of existing shore facilities at HMAS

        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of the issues raised in submissions to the inquiry was regarding proposed property acquisition by Defence. At the public hearing the Committee heard evidence from representatives of Defence, the Cairns Navy League and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Ship" rel="nofollow">
         Training Ship
        </a>
        <i>
         Endeavour
        </i>
        on this matter. After questioning witnesses, it became clear to the Committee that there were still unresolved issues and further consultation and negotiation had to be undertaken by Defence. At the hearing Defence reaffirmed its commitment to the Training Ship
        <i>
         Endeavour
        </i>
        and to working with all stakeholders to resolve the property acquisition issue in the best interest of the cadets. As a result the Committee recommends that the Department of Defence keep it informed of progress and the outcome of negotiations in respect to the acquisition by Defence of the Training Ship
        <i>
         Endeavour
        </i>
        land and facilities.
       </p>

        Defence submitted that an

        undertaken at HMAS

        had identified certain requirements for the construction work that would be incorporated into the project’s Construction and Environmental Management Plan (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEMP" rel="nofollow">
         CEMP
        </a>
        ). Defence added that in addition to the project-specific CEMP, HMAS
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        already has a Base Environmental Management Plan which is currently under review.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        recommends that the Department of Defence supply it with an updated copy of the HMAS
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        Base Environmental Management Plan which has will be amended to include the new works.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the Committee recommends that the proposed HMAS

        Redevelopment proceed at the estimated cost of $76.3 million.

        The Committee’s tenth report of 2006 presents findings in relation to the proposed construction of housing for Defence at Fairview Rise, Ipswich, Queensland, with the

       <p class="italic">
        The Committee inspected the site of the proposed development and conducted a public hearing in Ipswich on 16 May 2006. Issues explored at the hearing included house design, project delivery, traffic considerations, consultation and a range of environmental issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the public hearing, the Committee sought assurance from DHA that adequate water, electricity, gas and telecommunications connectivity would be provided to the site. Whilst DHA were able to confirm the provision of these sites services, however could not at the time confirm broadband internet facilitation for the site. Given the growing demand and importance of this service, the Committee recommends that DHA advise it on the provision of broadband connectivity within the Fairview Rise estate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DHA stated in its statement of evidence that an extended bus route could be introduced to the site bringing the majority of residents to within 400 metres of the nearest bus stop. After further questioning DHA confirmed that the main arteries are sufficient to accommodate a bus route, however are still in discussion with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich City Council
        </a>
        for an extended bus route. In this regard the Committee recommends that DHA advise it on the provision of an extended bus route for the site.
