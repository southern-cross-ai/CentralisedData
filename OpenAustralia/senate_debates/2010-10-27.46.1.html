        My question is to Senator Ludwig, the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        and Ageing. Prior to the election, the Prime Minister pronounced that mental health would be a second-term priority for the government, yet the Australian of the Year, Professor Patrick McGorry, as recently as last week described mental health now as a ‘very reactive, crisis-driven system’. He said: ‘It’s like placing ambulances at the bottom of the cliff, with no services at the top.’ Meanwhile, Professor Mendoza recently resigned in disgust as Chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Advisory_Council" rel="nofollow">
         National Advisory Council
        </a>
        on Mental Health. Given the collapse in confidence in the government’s handling of mental health by the sector’s leading experts, how can the Australian people have confidence in the Gillard government to deliver on mental health?

        <p>
         I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her question in this important area of mental health. The opposition and the government agree that mental health is an important issue. Mental illness causes great suffering in the Australian community, including tragic loss of life through suicides. The direct and indirect economic costs are also significant.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Gillard government has been leading in this area. It has made significant additional investments in mental health during its first term. This includes $1.2 billion for specific mental health programs over the next four years. In addition to the commitments contained in the 2010 budget, the Prime Minister committed a $277 billion package to tackle suicide.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the election campaign, Labor made it clear that there was more to do in the area of mental health. Everyone would agree that more should be done for those who suffer mental illness. In this area it would be a particular priority for a second-term Gillard government. This includes the recent appointment of the mental health minister. The task of the mental health minister, who I am representing here in this chamber, is about ensuring leadership in this very serious area.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are committed to building on the work done in our first term and to making lasting reform to mental health care which will provide the services that consumers and their families need. We will also ensure that existing programs and investments work as effectively as possible, given that there now is a minister with direct responsibility in this area, I expect that not only—

          , I ask a supplementary question. Yesterday the Labor-Green alliance failed to support the coalition’s motion to give effect to a policy which has been applauded by mental health experts. Indeed, Professor Mendoza was absolutely scathing of the government’s $277 million, which was referred to as ‘mere tokenism’. When will the government deliver the services that are so desperately needed by mental health consumers and their carers?

           health reform announcement and subsequently at the 2010 budget, the Australian government did commit—and I think we need to put this all in perspective—$277 billion during the election campaign, $78.8 million over four years commencing 2010-11 for the expansion of youth-friendly mental health services and $50.6 million over three years for Headspace, 30 sites and a range of national activities. The ‘Better access’ program is about ensuring that this government is committed to continuing its work in mental health with a dedicated mental health minister as a second-term priority. The mental health minister has been appointed to drive this agenda. The strong update of the better access items reflect the need in the community for mental health services.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. The Prime Minister has publicly stated that telephone calls to Lifeline will be toll-free from mobile phones. Even this modest promise has not yet been kept. When will it be met and how can the government believe that further delay is acceptable when you cannot even get that simple thing right?

In terms of the specific question that Senator Fierravanti-Wells has asked, I will ask the minister who is driving the agenda to provide an answer for her in relation to the specific issue around the call centre question.
