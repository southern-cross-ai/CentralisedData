        My question is to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy

         BT
        </a>
        to build a ₤2.5 billion optical fibre network to reach 17 million

       <p class="italic">
        It is not yet clear how the economics will stack up … some worry the build will be more expensive than expected while others fret about demand. Investors should be in no doubt that this is a gamble.

       <p>
        If a ₤2.5 billion network in a densely populated country is ‘a gamble’, how is a $43 billion investment in Australia not an even bigger gamble?

         I am not sure what bows you can draw from an entirely different scheme based in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         to the one here in Australia. I will reiterate that, notwithstanding that those opposite like to claim on the one hand that it is a dangerous, evil monopoly, on the other hand they keep claiming that we do not need it because wireless is taking over the world. The mutually inconsistent arguments being put by those opposite continue to be the basis of the question being put forward by the good senator.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we are seeing here in Australia is an agreement that has been reached to close down the copper network and replace it and upgrade it with the technology that will allow us to move into the 21st century with confidence so that we are able to take advantage of all the new education applications, the new health applications, the new sustainability smart grid style applications, the new aged care applications and the new veterans care applications—all of those are the reason that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         needs to be built. While those opposite, particularly some down in the far corner, used to believe in equality of access, and they used to believe in uniform pricing for the city and the bush, this government is committed to delivering. It is committed to delivering to all Australians massively improved broadband performance. The wireless and satellite networks will be 20 times better than what most Australians use today. The fibre optic network component will be at least 100 times faster and, if someone wanted a whole gig, it will be a thousand times faster than what many Australians have today.

                    Yes, it is, but it should not need to be. You should instruct Senator Conroy, because this is the second time he has done this, not to cast those sorts of comments on other members of the Senate.

                     : it is obviously up to you to rule whether the minister said anything inappropriate, but I point out that the minister is being constantly heckled. Senator Macdonald is one of the worst offenders in that regard. I suspect that, if the Liberal senators were not so unruly, they and you may have been able to hear what the minister was saying.
