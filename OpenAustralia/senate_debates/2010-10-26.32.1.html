       <p>
        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 59 standing in my name relating to key assumptions underpinning mining taxation, because a gremlin made a little mistake in the way it was published in the

        I move the motion as amended:

           the Government has refused to provide information requested by the Senate about key assumptions it has used to estimate revenue from its original as well as its revised mining tax proposals,

           (ii)

           (iii)
          </dt>
          <dd>
           in its response to the relevant order of the Senate, the Government justified its refusal to provide the information on the basis that, ‘commodity price forecasts underpinning the terms of trade forecasts are based in part on information provided by companies that is commercial in confidence. Disclosure of these individual commodity price forecast may therefore prejudice negotiations between private companies’,
