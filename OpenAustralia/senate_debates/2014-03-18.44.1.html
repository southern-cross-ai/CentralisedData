        My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sinodinos. I refer to the Assistant Treasurer's statement to the Senate on 28 February 2013 concerning Australian Water Holdings which he as minister saw fit to reaffirm on 6 March 2014. In that statement he asserted that at the time he became chair of the company he was not aware of the so-called loan arrangement with the Obeid family. Can the Assistant Treasurer confirm that in November 2010 the Obeid family bought 30 per cent of all shares in Australian Water Holdings? Did the Assistant Treasurer become aware of this purchase before or after his appointment as Assistant Treasurer?

         Again, as I have done consistently, I draw to the minister's attention that he needs to address that question in so much as it applies to his portfolio.

           , I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question was asking directly about timing of knowledge. It was a question about timing of knowledge before or after he took up this particular post.

            Order! If you wish to debate it, you do so after three o'clock. There is no point of order because the minister had given his answer and resumed his seat. I cannot tell a minister, anyway, how to answer a question. The minister had completed his answer when you took your point of order, so the minister, as far as I am concerned, had finished answering the question.
