        Today, the Government introduces the 2023-24 Additional Estimates

       <p class="italic">
        These Bills underpin the Government's expenditure decisions made since the 2023-24 Budget that relate to the 2023-24 financial year, including decisions made in the 2023-24 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 2023-24 MYEFO continued the Government's responsible economic and fiscal management, which has helped deliver the first budget surplus in 15 years and helped ease inflationary pressures at their peak. The fiscal position has further improved in the MYEFO with lower deficits and gross debt now forecast across the forward estimates compared to the 2023-24 Budget.
