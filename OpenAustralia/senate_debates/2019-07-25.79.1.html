              hold in relation to their appointments as commissioners to the disability royal commission. People with a disability, their organisations and supporters have called for these two commissioners to step down and for stronger provision for all commissioners about real, perceived and potential conflicts of interest. Labor is very concerned that many individuals and advocates from the disability community have said they will not participate or give evidence if these royal commissioners remain. It is essential that people with a disability, their families and carers and their organisations have confidence in the royal commission. It's time for the government to act.

                 Centre Alliance makes no disparaging remarks against the people that are involved in this, but there is a principle called apprehended bias. You'll be familiar with it in the courts. If there is a perceived conflict of interest, judges will normally recuse themselves, not because there is bias but because there's an apprehension of bias, and an innocent bystander who walks past the court must always be fully confident as to the impartiality. That's the issue here. So we will be supporting the motion, but we make no disparaging remarks against the highly qualified and esteemed people that have been named in the motion.

                    This motion is not making any particular commentary on the qualification of the appointed commissioners to do the jobs they were in. This motion relates to their ability to do the jobs they have been appointed to, and the reality is that these two individuals are disqualified based on the conflict of interest that arises from their immediate past employment as senior bureaucrats within the very systems and processes that this commission will investigate. They do not have the confidence of the disability community, they will shortly no longer enjoy the confidence of this Senate, and the government must immediately move to replace these commissioners with folks the disability community can trust.

                       The Jacqui Lambie Network is absolutely horrified at this. This is no different to having a royal commission into veterans affairs and putting past secretaries on a panel like that. That would be absolutely horrifying. I cannot believe that you would actually do this in the first place. It's like putting someone that's been abused back in front of their abuser, and it's absolutely horrifying that it's been done in the first place.
