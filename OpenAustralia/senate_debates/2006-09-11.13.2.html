        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. On this, the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attack on the United States of America, will the minister update the Senate on the work being done by Commonwealth law enforcement agencies to address the threat of terrorist attacks in Australia?

         I thank Senator Ferguson for what is a very important question on this fifth anniversary of the terrorist attack on the United States. At the outset can I say that that was an attack which was not only on the United States of America. Although it occurred on the soil of the United States, it was an attack against the free world as we know it.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is an opportune time to reflect not only on the tragic loss of life but on the war on terrorism that we have been engaged in since then. In fact, we have seen, tragically, since 11 September 2001 those attacks which have occurred in other places which have affected Australia, indeed with a loss of Australian life. Indeed in our own region we have experienced a war on terrorism and the continuing war against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiah" rel="nofollow">
          Jemaah Islamiah
         </a>
         , which preaches a litany of hate and is intent on destroying not only Western civilisation but also those people who have their own religion and stand in their way.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Ferguson has asked what we have done in the wake of 11 September 2001 to ensure that Australia’s security interests are served. Of course, we have seen a huge change in the way the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         has carried out the very good work that it does in protecting Australia’s interests. We have seen funding for the Australian Federal Police quadruple and we have seen legislation passed which has given that organisation the strength it needs to protect Australia. We have seen an unprecedented engagement not only in the region but overseas in working with foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the war against terrorism. That has been very successful, and I point to no less than the investigation which followed the first Bali bombing. That has been used as a template, I would suggest, internationally where you have two countries of vastly different cultures, such as Indonesia and Australia, coming together and working intensively to bring about the result that we have seen in the wake of that first Bali bombing. We have increased funding and resources to

         </a>
         and to the Customs agency, which plays an essential part in protecting our borders. Of course, ASIO does an outstanding job working not only with Australian agencies but with overseas intelligence agencies in protecting Australia’s interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have seen in the aviation sector unprecedented levels of security where we have air security officers flying domestically and on some international routes. We have seen airport commanders put in place, an increase in our counter-terrorism first response with the Australian Federal Police’s
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protective_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Protective Service
         </a>
         and also our rapid regional response teams for aviation security in our regions. As well as that, we have seen increases in maritime security. We now have reporting requirements of vessels which intend making a first port of call to Australia. We have increased our first port of call inspections by Customs. As well as that, we have seen Customs increase its border patrols in our remote regions, because it is not only at our airports and our sea ports but also in those remote regions that we have to have increased security.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I have always said, security is a work in progress and we cannot do it alone, and we certainly acknowledge our close allies, including the United Kingdom—and we have

We acknowledge the great relationship we have with and the cooperation we get from the United Kingdom and also from the government of China—and I acknowledge the delegation here today and acknowledge the cooperation we have with that country as well in relation to the war on terrorism.
