        This morning, the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and

         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        Voice) 2023 was introduced in the other place. The voice is supposedly about giving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people a say in this country. Yet this week we have seen that it is nothing but smoke and mirrors. The intention to listen to us is not real. We know that the parliament will decide which advice to take and which not. But it is now clear that the government doesn't even have the intention to let us decide what we should actually provide advice about. The voice proposal states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice may make representations to the Parliament and the Executive Government of the Commonwealth on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples …
       </p>
       <p>
        However, Prime Minister Albanese thinks he knows what relates to us and what doesn't. When asked if the voice could provide advice on matters like the safeguard mechanism, he said, 'That was a strange question.' He said that the voice was about matters that directly affect First Nations people. Well, believe it or not, climate change affects us directly and its impacts hit us often harder than others. But apparently that is not something we should get a say on. The government also thinks that AUKUS doesn't affect us. But it affects our lands and waters, which we have cared for for thousands of years. If you ask me, this is really saying that we are too dumb to provide advice on complex matters. I can't tell you how much knowledge, expertise and wisdom there is in our own communities. We as people certainly don't get to judge whether something affects us or not. The comments from the

         () (): I want to address what I believe to be a complete failure of this chamber yesterday. A motion for reference to a committee of the matter of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         representative organisations was voted down by one vote. All 30 of the noes denied vulnerable Australians who have been crying out to have their voices heard the chance for an inquiry of land councils and other Indigenous bodies—no surprise, though, that they came almost exclusively from the Labor government and the Greens. When last week I hosted a delegation of 22 Aboriginal community leaders right here in Canberra, no Labor or Green MP who voted no yesterday came to meet with them—not a single one. Not a single Labor MP in the building came to meet with them—not one. Not a single Green came to meet them—not one.
        </p>
        <p>
         But one of the no votes—in fact, the deciding no vote—did meet with them. I refer to the so-called Independent senator for Canberra, who sat with three elders in his office and nodded along while they shared their concerns, while they made their case to him directly, while they used their voices to plead for help. But he did not listen. He thinks he knows best about who should have their voices heard and who shouldn't. We were simply asking for an inquiry to see what was really happening, and he would not even support that. Why? Because he claims he doesn't want to interfere with the voice referendum. What a joke! How's this for logic. The senator from Canberra doesn't want to listen to the voices of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Aboriginal Australians
         </a>
         in case it interferes with a campaign for a body that they claim is about Aboriginal voices. Shame on every single one of you who refuse to listen to these voices, and shame on every single one of you who don't want to listen to Aboriginal voices who have a differing view to your own.
