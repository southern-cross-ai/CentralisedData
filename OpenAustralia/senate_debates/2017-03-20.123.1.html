        I rise to seek an explanation pursuant to standing order 74(5). I seek an explanation from the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services as to why my question on notice No. 308 to that minister remains unanswered.

         In response to this, I will outline that Senator Wong acted in good faith and we did have a discussion about this in February. While I was in the chamber this afternoon prior to question time, I did receive information that Senator Wong's office had contacted mine. Senator Wong wrote to me this afternoon about this. What I can say before I provide an explanation is the statement I have received from the minister's office in the other place: 'The Department of Human Services and the Minister for Human Services take this matter very seriously and are intent on having an accurate and fulsome response. The response is in the final stages of review and, I am advised, will be provided before 31 March 2017.' I was of the understanding it was going to be provided not long after my conversation with Senator Wong in February. I understand and I will be pursuing it with my office. Senator Wong's office contacted mine. Senator Wong has said that to date her office has not received a response. My office said they did so by telephone. I will be pursuing that when I get back to the office and I will be pursuing this question with the minister.

          I move:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          That the Senate take note of the explanation.
         </p>
         <p>
          I appreciate the position that Senator Ryan is in; however, this question was due to be answered in January of this year. A month after the answer was due, as a matter of courtesy, we contacted his office to indicate we would be seeking an explanation and sent a copy of the relevant question. We were informed at the time that the answer in question was on the relevant minister's desk. Anticipating that the answer would be forthcoming in good faith, I did not seek an explanation that day. Notwithstanding that it is one month ago, we are still waiting for the answer. I think significant courtesy has been shown by the opposition. I would ask the minister if he could please ensure that his counterpart provides him with the answer forthwith.
