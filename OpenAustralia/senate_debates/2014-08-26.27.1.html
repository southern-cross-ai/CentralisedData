        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. Minister, before the 2013 federal election Prime Minister Abbott said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … we have no plans to change the renewable energy target.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister Hunt said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We also agree on the renewable energy target and one of the things we do not want to do is to become a party where there's this wild sovereign risk …
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Birmingham said he supported a 41,000 gigawatt-hour target. Now that the Prime Minister has made it clear that he wants to either abolish or massively reduce the renewable energy target, do you now admit that the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party lied to the Australian community at the 2013 election about the renewable energy target?

         You have to admire the absolute front of the Labor-Greens alliance in this place. Talking about broken promises are the Labor Party, the architects of the carbon tax—and now we have the leader of the

              In the legislation that established the renewable energy target there was the requirement for a review to be undertaken. That review is being undertaken as we speak. It will, in due course, report to government. We will ascertain what that report has to say and, like any good government, we will consider that report and determine what the appropriate approach is for the future of the Australian people.

               , I ask a supplementary question. The Prime Minister has given the Australian people one reason for destroying the renewable energy target, and that is to reduce electricity bills. I ask the minister: given that there are now half a dozen reports, including the ACIL Allen report, showing electricity prices will be lower if the

                There is an assertion in the question that, of course, has absolutely no foundation. The government has made no decision in this area; it is awaiting a report. It will consider the report and then determine its approach.
               </p>
               <p>
                It makes sense when you have a report of this nature that there will be a number of submissions to the committee or to the review panel. It stands to reason that there will be views expressed that differ. That is why you have a panel of this nature, to try to determine what the appropriate approach will be for the future benefit of our nation and for the future benefit of the Australian people. That is what motivates us and that is what will drive our approach to this issue.

With Suntech pulling out of research and development in Australia and Silex pulling out of the Mildura concentrated solar plant because of massive sovereign risk and uncertainty generated by the government, why is the government fuelling that uncertainty by refusing to release the Warburton review?

                  I cannot assist the honourable senator as to the date of the release, but as is the wont with these reports the government will consider the report when it is ready to respond to it. It will release the report and respond to it. Let us be very clear in relation to this and other matters. You can point to the odd situation here and there. We know what the carbon tax did to this nation and we finally got rid of it, thanks to Palmer United, the
