        I begin by saying hello to all of the Labor members who live down in the area of Farrer in the Riverina. In particular, I acknowledge the branch leadership at the Griffith branch. I pay tribute today to the life of a great member of the Griffith Labor Party, Peter Knox. He was a Labor stalwart who fought for his values all through his life, in the toughest of territories for Labor. He was a very honourable man and was highly regarded by his colleagues in the Labor Party and also by local constituents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter joined the Labor Party in 1972 after attending a campaign meeting held by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        in a local club in Griffith. Peter was born in Ardlethan but lived most of his life in Griffith, where he worked as a qualified painter. He later ran for parliament as a Labor candidate in 2007. In the course of that battle, he achieved a sizeable 4.62 per cent swing to Labor. He later went on to serve as the senior vice president of the Griffith branch.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter never stopped advocating for Labor beliefs and policy. He stood on prepoll booths as a servant of democracy for the last 45 years of elections. What a great Australian. Whatever party you belong to, to stand up for your values and principles and serve democracy in that way is a profound contribution to our democratic structures.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also know that he fought very hard for a midweek train service from Sydney to Griffith. Peter was a life member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
         United Services Union
        </a>
        , a dedicated supporter of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Swans
        </a>
        and a big fan of cold beer at the Exies club in Griffith.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, Peter left us on 14 September last year, aged 82, after a long battle with lung disease. He will be sorely missed by his friends and family, but his life stands as tribute to his Labor values and his advocacy. Vale, Peter Knox. I pray that his memory is a blessing.
