        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Investment, Senator Payne. This morning, former Australian trade negotiator, Dr Ruth Lopert,—now one of Minister Robb's so-called scaremongers who has questioned the secretive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement—publicly stated that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
         TPP
        </a>
        will cost 'possibly hundreds of millions of dollars to the government' in higher medicine costs. She went on to say that through intellectual property and patent law changes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The taxpayer will be paying more and ultimately if this affects the long-term sustainability of the PBS (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        ) that will likely be pushed onto consumers through higher co-payments.
       </p>
       <p>
        She gave the example of the drug Humira, which is a biologic used to treat arthritis, and said that a one-year delay in the market entry of a follow-on version of that drug to a competitor would mean savings foregone of roughly $44 million a year. Will the government rule out changes to Australia's domestic intellectual property or patent laws via the TPP that will punish Australian taxpayers?

         I will take the more specific aspects of the last part of Senator Whish-Wilson's question on notice and seek some advice from the Minister for Trade and Investment. What I can say is that the government have made their position on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
          TPP
         </a>
         process perfectly clear. We will not accept any outcome in the TPP that would adversely affect Australia's health system. We will not sign up to any international agreement that restricts the Australian government's capacity to govern in Australia's own interests, whether it is in the area of health care, the environment or in any other regulated area of the economy. The minister has also made absolutely clear that there has been extensive consultation in the process leading up to the TPP development. In fact I think we are now up to over 1,000 stakeholder consultations since 2011. That includes 150 with a broad range of stakeholders who are interested in public health issues, for example—

             . Had I been able to finish the sentence, I was going to say that those thousand consultations included 150 with a broad range of stakeholders interested in public health areas. There were 50 in the past year. They included Medicines Australia, Choice, the Public Health Association of Australia and intellectual property experts. In fact, just for passing interest, it also included 14 consultations with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
              ACTU
             </a>
             , for example, re the labour chapter of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
              TPP
             </a>
             . The stakeholder consultations are invaluable in shaping our negotiating positions. I said very clearly when I began that the government will not accept a position in the TPP process that would adversely affect Australia's health system.

                 Let me repeat, the government's position is clear. We will not accept any outcome in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
                  TPP
                 </a>
                 that would adversely affect Australia's health system. We will not sign up to any international agreement that restricts Australia's capacity to govern in its own interest, whether in the area of health care, the environment or any other regulated area of the economy.

                  , the pharmaceutical payments review and, most recently, the Harper review into competition policy—another bunch of scaremongers—have all recommended that an independent economic analysis of the intellectual property and patent provisions in trade deals be carried out and published before any negotiations are concluded. Will the government listen to these groups and ask the Productivity Commission to undertake an economic analysis of
