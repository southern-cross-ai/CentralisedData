                There is no question before the chair to amend. The matter has been dealt with in the previous motion, so there is nothing to amend. You are in order to seek leave to do anything, but you cannot do what you want to do in that regard, because there is nothing to amend. You will have to rephrase it in a different matter. For clarity: there is a motion to be moved by leave circulated. Is this the motion that you wish to move?

                     legislation through the Senate, yet, when given an opportunity on a silver platter, they reject it. There is an opportunity now to debate this legislation, putting it in front of all other government business, but, together with a deal you made with the Greens, you are ignoring something that you claim to be some of the most important legislation you need to put to the Senate. To quote the Prime Minister, 'We would not be having this debate had the Senate actually voted for these amendments.' We are now standing with the opportunity to have this debate, and the government is rejecting it and the Greens are allowing it to happen to put self-interest ahead of the people of Australia. It is an absolute disgrace.

                    <p>
                     The amendments you have rushed through the parliament for a bill we are all going to discuss very soon and which had a very poor committee stage, are not what you or the government claim it to be. The bill has only recently come out of the committee stage. I even supported the government in an attempt to avoid the bill being referred to the committee in the first place when it had the reporting date of 15 March, which was pulled back to the end of last week so it could be debated in the committee of the whole, so the government cannot claim that the crossbench was not being proactive in trying to assist them in at least debating this in the Senate. There were amendments which were worthwhile to discuss and which should be put ahead of electoral reform which you are putting forward in your own interest. There is no secret that I was trying to work with the government. I even went and visited the Minister for Employment in her office in Perth. I was more than happy at least to sit down, have this conversation and be proactive.

                    <p>
                     The government is claiming that electoral reform needs to come through to rid it of the crossbenchers in the Senate to stop an unorderly Senate. Only a handful of bills have actually been knocked back. There has been some terrible policy.

                     have agreed to that, yet they are trying to give you the majority in the Senate for the future to come. It is an absolute disgrace. The problem is not the crossbench. We are here trying to work with you, all having a diverse amount of views, something the Greens should be sticking up for. But we are not discussing innovation, progress or tax; we are discussing self-interest ahead of what the government claims to be their most important legislation.

                    <p>
                     Only a handful of bills have been rejected. The government is blaming the crossbench rather than looking in their own backyard to see that the ministerial changes all the time are part of their problem. By getting rid of the diverse Senate and wedging the Greens into a position of power—have fun. Oh my god, you're going to have some fun! But the people of Australia are going to see through this.

                       <p>
                        The government's motion states that if certain bills have not been finally considered by adjournment on Wednesday then on Thursday we will have special arrangements and we will not adjourn until either these bills are finally considered or a minister moves a motion for the adjournment.

                       <p>
                        My motion—my amendment—adds the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2013 to the list of bills that trigger special arrangements on Thursday, and it prevents a minister from moving a motion for Thursday's adjournment until at least this bill has been finally considered. My amendment does not limit the government's ability to require the final consideration of the bills on its list; it just requires that there also be consideration of the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2013.

                       <p>
                        The Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2013 was introduced in December 2013, was debated extensively in November 2015, and largely replicates a bill debated in the previous parliament in August 2012. The Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2013 is a Greens' bill. I support this bill—even though it differs from the Liberal Democrats' own bill on this issue, the Freedom to Marry Bill 2014—because I support allowing same-sex marriage, irrespective of which party's bill finally makes this a reality. I propose that the Greens' bill be the one we add to this motion, because the Greens are the swing vote on this motion. I do not want to see an opportunity to allow same-sex marriage squandered, just because the Greens did not like a detail of someone else's same-sex marriage bill.

                        have said that parliament should deal with same-sex marriage and that there is no cause for delay. They have repeated this position recently at

                        and in the wake of the Safe Schools debate, which foreshadows the kind of debate we would see in the lead-up to a plebiscite. I do not look forward to an expensive and divisive plebiscite where people would be asked to vote on other people's rights. The potential for coalition parliamentarians to vote as a block against allowing same-sex marriage is not a reason to put off a parliamentary vote. It is a reason to proceed. Each voter should know before an election whether their coalition parliamentarian is committed to allowing same-sex marriage. It would be perverse and undemocratic for the Greens to avoid parliamentary consideration of their own bill just to provide coalition parliamentarians with cover on this issue.

                        . Supporting this amendment simply means that you do not fear voting on the issue of same-sex marriage and you accept that it is part of your job.

If this is just crocodile tears, if this is some political tactic, if this is simply some opportunity to play wedge politics with an issue as serious as ending prejudice in marriage once and for all, then the Australian Labor Party will support ensuring that we bring in this debate on Thursday during private senators' time—during their private senators' time. If this is not just some political tactic in an effort to overturn a democratic reform—incidentally a reform that they have supported for many years, and, in fact, that many of their own side continue to support—then we will support any endeavour from the Australian Labor Party to bring this on for a vote.

                            The question is now for you, Senator Wong. Will you ensure that we get legislation through this parliament on Thursday in the time that you have allotted on an issue that we have all collectively as a community fought so long and hard for? Will you ensure it sees passage through this parliament? Will you, through your action, fuel a vote on Thursday to ensure that we end discrimination on marriage once and for all? The question now is: is this just some sneaky political tactic in an effort to overturn a democratic reform that you, yourself, are on the record as supporting? Is that what this is about? Are you playing wedge politics with an issue? Because, if you are not, let us do it on Thursday. Let us ensure the passage of legislation this week. We can get it done.

                                Senator Dastyari, that is disorderly. Before I call Senator Di Natale, I remind all senators that interjections are disorderly. I know it is a tense moment, but we need to just have a bit of decorum and a bit of order and allow the speakers to be heard. Senator Di Natale, you have the call.

                                 I think the saddest thing that could happen with the issue of marriage equality is that a wedge be driven between those advocates who support marriage equality. It does not have to be that way. What we can have now is a commitment from the Labor Party to ensure that on Thursday in private senators' time this legislation will be brought on for debate. If they are not prepared to do that, these are crocodile tears. It is cynical wedge politics. This is too important an issue to be used as a political football. Those people who have supported this reform now for decades would be disgusted if this was simply some cheap political tactic. (
