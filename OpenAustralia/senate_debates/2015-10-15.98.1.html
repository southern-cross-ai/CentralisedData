He is assisted in that portfolio by Assistant Minister Ruston. That is exactly what we have been saying all week: Minister Joyce as the minister with the portfolio of Agriculture and Water Resources is responsible for water. And, as I said earlier in the week, as a member of a very happy coalition with our friends in the National Party—

           , I raise a point of order as to direct relevance. It is not about general responsibilities between the ministers or who does what. It is specifically about water buybacks. So if you could draw the attention of the minister to the single question: who is responsible for water buybacks?

            I think that the minister did indicate that Minister Joyce and Assistant Minister Ruston were responsible jointly. That was my interpretation, but the minister can elaborate on that if he wishes to.

             Thank you for the affirmation to my friends in the Nationals. So, as the cabinet minister in the portfolio, Mr Joyce is ultimately responsible for all elements of water except for those that are with the environment portfolio, as set out in the administrative orders, and that is quite clear. It is quite clear, and I hope that you have taken the opportunity to read the administrative orders since we talked about them earlier in the week. So, ultimately, as Minister Joyce is responsible for infrastructure in the water portfolio, he is responsible for water buybacks. So, ultimately, as the portfolio minister responsible for agriculture and water resources, and, of course, we know as Minister Joyce has himself said—

               , as I have said a number of times already this week, the government are committed to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Our intention is to deliver the plan in full and on time. That is our intention. So, if you understand the plan, you understand what our intention is. There is no confusion here. There is no reason for concern. Quite frankly, I am quite mystified by the reason that the opposition seem to be so fascinated by this particular matter. It is quite clear.

                  There appears to be somewhat of a comprehension problem on the other side, because I quite clearly said that we are committed to the plan. Now, if we were not committed to the plan, then your question may have had some substance. And you might have adjusted your question based on my previous answer, because I said quite clearly that we are committed to the delivery of the plan. That does not imply to me in any way that the minister has any plans to suspend the plan—if we are committed to its delivery. So I repeat for the benefit of the opposition, who appear to be quite slow learners, that we are committed to the plan and the delivery of the plan in full and on time.
