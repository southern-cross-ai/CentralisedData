        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. Is the minister aware of reports that the motor vessel
        <i>
         Sun Sea
        </i>
        carrying a number of potential unlawful entrants is en route to Australia? Given the suspected links between this vessel and an organised
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Tiger" rel="nofollow">
         Tamil Tiger
        </a>
        people-smuggling operation, can the minister assure the Australian people, particularly in view of those concerns, that the motor vessel
        <i>
         Sun Sea
        </i>
        will not be allowed to enter Australian waters?

         I thank Senator Brandis for the question. As I made clear to the opposition the other day when I had a similar question, I will not of course be discussing in the Senate any advice we get from intelligence or defence sources about potential people-smuggling or other ventures. So, when he asks me about an alleged venture on a particular boat that may or may not involve a people-smuggling operation and may or may not have connections with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Tiger" rel="nofollow">
          Tamil Tiger
         </a>
         s, I clearly am not able to assist him in discussing any of those issues publicly. But what I can say is that if a vessel containing people seeking asylum or people who enter unlawfully does arrive that boat will be intercepted, the persons will be interviewed, those seeking asylum will be taken into detention—

           As I was saying, any persons detected entering Australian waters unlawfully will be detained. Those seeking asylum will be mandatorily detained and taken to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
            Christmas Island
           </a>
           . They will remain in mandatory detention until such time as they have completed health, identity and security checks and before their asylum claims are considered and determined. All persons will be interviewed by our security agencies and any suggestions of activity involving terrorist or criminal organisations will be investigated and examined. As I say, no-one would be granted asylum or moved to the mainland if the security agencies had security concerns about those persons.

            yesterday? Doesn’t the fact that boats carrying suspected illegal asylum seekers continuing to arrive on our shores demonstrate that Labor has lost control of our borders? Does the minister agree with the current Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, when as opposition spokesperson on immigration she said that another boat is another policy failure?

                , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the minister aware that, according to the most recent information available from his department, at the end of May there were 3,733 people in detention? Is the minister also aware that since then over 501 more people have arrived illegally by boat, including another 53 only yesterday? Will the minister confirm that there are now more people detained under Labor’s failed border protection policies than at any time before?

                <p>
                 I can say that in broad terms the figures quoted by the senator are close to the figures that I have for total numbers in detention. It is true that we are dealing with an increased level of arrivals and therefore increased numbers in detention. This is because we do mandatorily detain all arrivals and do put them through rigorous health, security and identity checks. They are not released from mandatory detention unless those checks have occurred and then there is a very rigorous assessment of their asylum claims. I would remind the senator, because he chooses to forget, because it is convenient for him to forget, that between 1999 and 2001 the Howard government had 12,000 arrivals and most of them were left to rot in detention for many years.

                           The substance of the question is what the government will do in terms of its asylum pause on persons arriving from

                            Sri Lanka
                           </a>
                           as unauthorised boat arrivals. As I have indicated publicly, both then and subsequently, the three-month pause is due to be reviewed no later than 8 July. The cabinet will consider the effect of the pause and other advice relating to unauthorised boat arrivals from Sri Lanka and other advice about developments inside Sri Lanka, particularly in terms of the treatment of those of Tamil ethnicity and whether or not conditions are improving for those persons and whether that might be impacting on asylum claims from those Tamils who have been resident in Sri Lanka. That decision in terms of the suspension will be taken by the cabinet. As I say, the deadline for review is 8 July. The cabinet will make that decision. We will consider all that information in making that decision. So I just assure the senator that the review will occur as indicated at the time of the announcements.

                            , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. Given the new Prime Minister has acknowledged that a number of election commitments have not been met, does the minister now accept that the suspension policy is a breach of the commitment to detention as a last resort?

                             Simply, no. That is not the case at all. You ought to read the policy more carefully because you will note that the first point in our detention policy is a commitment to the mandatory detention of unauthorised boat arrivals. I know you do not support that policy, but that is the policy we took to the election. It is a policy we have continued to implement as a government. We mandatorily detain all unauthorised arrivals for the purposes of identity, security and health checks. We allow people to have their claims assessed against the refugee convention if they seek to make those claims. So those election commitments have been honoured and will continue to be honoured. As I said, I think you misread the commitments we made. We have made it very clear that we maintain a strong commitment to mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals.

What we know is that country information from both countries is changing. There are a number of reports due which will give us a better insight into changing conditions. What I can say is that, of those claims currently being considered, we have seen a large increase in rejections particularly of Afghans but also of
