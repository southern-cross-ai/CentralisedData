        My question is to Senator Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Is the minister aware that the Queensland shadow minister for the environment has called for the abolition of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Marine Park Authority, with its functions to be transferred to the state government? Does the minister agree with Mr Rob Messenger when he claims that the authority has been taken over by an elite, ideologically driven minority? Can the minister also tell the Senate if he agrees with statements by another Queensland coalition candidate, Dr Paul Joice, that the authority is ‘totally out of control and has lied to fishermen’? Given that Dr Joice has urged him to get on with it by abolishing the authority, can the minister give a guarantee that the government has no plans to abolish the

             As I said, it has been a very, very long time since the Labor Party took an interest in environmental issues. They certainly take an interest in building industrial facilities on the Gippsland coast—they are very keen to build industrial facilities around the coast—but it has been a long time since they took an interest in an environmental issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am always very happy to receive questions about the

              Great Barrier Reef
             </a>
             , because, when you compare the coalition government’s record on protecting the Great Barrier Reef with what that mob did in their time, and what they proposed under their existing Latham-Beazley policy on the Great Barrier Reef, you see a phenomenal contrast between the Labor Party and the record of the Howard government on protecting one of the great Australian icons of the environment, the Great Barrier Reef—a distinguished record of environmental protection for the Great Barrier Reef going back to the years of

            <p>
             There is a stark contrast between the Labor Party and the coalition, which only two years ago put in place a policy of increasing the protection for the reef from the four per cent of the reef area that was protected under the previous Labor regime. As a result of the coalition’s policies we have improved the protection of the reef, the no-take zones and the marine protected areas to 34 per cent of the reef, a massive achievement.

                  Marine Park Authority, an increase to 34 per cent, and that of the previous Labor regime. When you focus on the issue of the protection of the reef and the role the

                  </a>
                  plays in that—and, of course, it was very contentious along the Queensland coast—and when you move from protection of four per cent to 34 per cent and remove the fishing effort that was involved there, at a cost of in excess of $100 million to date, you create a lot of angst in the local community.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Of course, the key issue on that coast, leading up to the last election was: just what would Labor do in relation to the park and the boundaries? And the

                  ’s policy on protection of the reef stands in stark contrast to ours. When I was asked the question: ‘What would you do?’ I said, ‘We will stand by the boundaries and we will pay structural adjustment to the fishing industries and the tourism industries.’ Of course, when Labor was asked the question—

                     Marine Park Authority on at least half a dozen occasions. I think perhaps Senator Conroy should go and get a cotton bud and get his ears cleaned out. When Labor were asked what they were going to do about protection of the marine park under the auspices of the marine park authority, Mr Latham said he was going to review the boundaries—tear up the boundaries. And that remains their policy.

                    <p>
                     The coalition have a policy of protecting the reef and giving structural adjustment to those who have been affected by the massive increase in the protection of that reef to make it the most well-protected reef in the world. It is the best managed reef in the world. That is our policy. Labor’s policy is to tear up the boundaries and leave the protection of the reef—which was put in place by the Howard government—at risk. I challenge Senator McLucas to get up and say that they have now torn up the Latham policy and that they will stand by the Australian government’s boundaries.

                      , I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister gave no guarantee about the future of the Great Barrier Marine Park Authority. Can the minister confirm that a proposal for the abolition of the authority will go to cabinet in the next few weeks?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Hasn’t the government been careful to avoid announcing this change prior to the Queensland election? Can the minister confirm that these coalition candidates have, in fact, let the cat out of the bag? Finally, will the minister come out and tell us who is right: Dr Joice, who wants the authority’s functions sent to Canberra, or Mr Messenger, who wants the functions sent to the Queensland government?
