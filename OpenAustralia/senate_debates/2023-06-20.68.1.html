        My question is to the Minister for Women, Senator Gallagher. Minister, the Albanese government's $2 billion investment in the Social Housing Accelerator program is a significant commitment to improving housing outcomes for Australians. We all know that housing is one of the most important policy areas right now, after a decade of neglect by the coalition government. Given that women, particularly single mothers, are disproportionately affected through housing insecurity, could the minister elaborate on how this investment will specifically benefit women and contribute to addressing the housing challenges they face?

         I thank Senator Pratt for the question. The Albanese government's $2 billion investment in the Social Housing Accelerator program is a significant step forward towards addressing Australia's housing challenges. This investment will deliver thousands of new social rental homes across the country. With this investment we are working to reverse the decline of national housing stock that we've seen over the past decadeâ€”a decade of neglect and little action from those opposite when they were in government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now we've inherited this situation, with extensive waiting lists for public housing across state and territory governments and a massive shortfall of supply. But the government is working hard to meet these unfulfilled needs. Our investment will be of particular benefit for women, who are disproportionately affected by housing insecurity and are more likely to experience housing stress. Women are less likely to be able to save for a deposit, are less likely to own their own home and are the fastest-growing cohort at risk of homelessness. Homelessness is of course a particular risk for women who need to flee domestic violence situations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our investment in social housing will directly benefit women experiencing housing stress or at risk of homelessness by increasing the supply of affordable homes. The government's $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator program allows for a range of approaches to boost social housing stock right across the country. This means we can target the areas of greatest need, including areas where single mums, older women and women and children fleeing domestic violence live.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, our investment in social housing is part of a broader housing agenda that includes measures specifically designed to support women. We're providing $67.5 million to states to help tackle homelessness, and $350 million through the Housing Accord to build 20,000 new affordable rentals in the next five years. We could do more if the Housing Australia Future Fund passed the Senate.

           Could the minister please advise the Senate on how the Social Housing Accelerator program works alongside other initiatives of the Albanese government to improve housing outcomes for women. Here I am thinking that women on low incomes, women fleeing domestic violence and older women. How will these initiatives by the Albanese Labor government assist all these groups of women?

            I thank Senator Pratt for the supplementary. The Social Housing Accelerator program is just one part of our comprehensive housing agenda, which is being led by Minister Julie Collins. In 2022-23 the Albanese government will spend $9.5 billion to help address our nation's housing challenges. As the senators will be aware, there is the $10 billion Housing Australian Future Fund, which is designed to build 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes in its first five years, but unfortunately that bill has been postponed in the Senate and so that fund has been prevented from being established because of the Senate's refusal to debate and finalise that bill. This means that 4,000 housing properties specifically for women and children fleeing domestic and family violence and older women on low incomes who are at risk of homelessness are not able to be delivered.

              Minister, how does the Albanese Labor government's investment in social housing compare to the efforts of the previous government to address housing insecurity among women? We know there has recently been a decade of neglect and waste from the coalition and that our government is playing catch-up, but can be minister compare and contrast the two governments?

               I thank Senator Pratt for the supplementary. In the Albanese government there is a government that's interested in social housing and that's interested in making sure that we work with the states and territories to respond to the significant challenges being faced across the country when it comes to housing affordability and access to affordable rental properties. That is in contrast to the way that the former government engaged with states and territories on the housing agenda. This $2 billion investment in the Social Housing Accelerator program is the largest investment that has been made in social and affordable housing, and we know from the advice of states and territories just how important this investment is going to be to make sure that they can deal with some of the more urgent and unmet needs that were allowed to grow over the past decade because of the failure of the former government to address this need and work in partnerships with the states and territories, as we intend to do.

                      Thank you. I'm running out of time here, but I will answer the very sensible question from Senator Pocock. To particularly answer the direct question, we will soon launch the formal consultation on the plan, which will set out the 10-year strategy to inform housing and homelessness policy in Australia. The Minister for Housing, Minister Collins, who's doing a terrific job, I might add, in the most difficult of circumstances, remains committed to the housing commitment in the housing portfolio under Closing the Gap. Through the housing reform agenda, the Albanese government is committed to reducing overcrowding for

                      and to seeing improvements in all states currently experiencing overcrowding. But we accept, Senator Pocock, your fundamental proposition that there is a lot more to do. The Albanese government is committed to working with our state and territory counterparts to ensure more Australians have a safe and affordable place to call home.

                                     We will bring this back as soon as we understand that either the Greens have come to their senses or the coalition have changed their attitudes and we can get this through. There's no point wastingâ€”

                                       I know the Greens are really upset and embarrassed by the decision to line up with the coalition, but, the moment we get clarity that the Greens are going to back this legislation, it's going to be back here. I know, Senator Pocock, that you've got the common sense to support this legislation. If only the Greens had the same common sense.
