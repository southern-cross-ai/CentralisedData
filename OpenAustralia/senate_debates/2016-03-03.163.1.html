         Thank you for the question, Senator Johnston. Yesterday I had the opportunity to bring to the chamber the fantastic results for the Australian tourism industry, which has been identified as one of Australia's five supergrowth sectors. Today it is a real pleasure to talk in respect of one of my other responsibilities, which is international education, also identified as one of Australia's supergrowth sectors. Last year, international education was worth $19.65 billion to the Australian economy and employed in excess of 130,000 Australiansâ€”a lot of Australian jobs are in the international education sector. I am delighted to inform the Senate that we set a record in 2015, with 498,155 international students choosing to study in Australia. International student mobility has increased considerably over the last decade, with employers increasingly seeking employees with international experience. This trend is likely to increase. Australia is very well placed to increase our share of international students, as one of the top three countries in the world for international education. We are committed to growing our market share.

         A few weeks ago, I attended English Australia's biggest English lesson in the world on

          Bondi Beach
         </a>
         . Over 3,000 students from 62 countries attended, which gives a clear indication of the breadth of students attracted to Australia. They achieved their quest to set a

         for the largest ever English lesson. This was a fantastic event on the shores of Bondi Beach and clearly demonstrated Australia's capacity in the international education space.

           Since 2003 Australia has almost doubled the number of international students studying here on shore. For a country of our size, we punch well and truly above our weight when it comes to attracting international students. We recognise that the student experience is key to boosting our market share, and the 2014 student survey indicated that 93 per cent of students said they chose Australia because of the quality of our courses but also because of the institutional reputations and, of course, for the safety in this country. Also, our post-study work rights are a real incentive for international students who may seek to remain in Australia after the successful completion of their studies.

             As I have already indicated, international education has been identified as one of Australia's supergrowth sectors of the economy. Key priority markets have been identified for future growth, and we expect onshore opportunities to come in the future from China, which is currently our largest source of students, India, the Philippines, Thailand and Nepal, to name a few. The most likely markets for growth in the future are India, China, Vietnam,

              Hong Kong
             </a>
             . To realise the full potential of this sector, the Turnbull government is developing and will release quite soon the first ever international education strategy, which will seek to provide a pathway for future expansion of international education both here in Australia and through transnational education. I am planning to launch this strategy in coming months.
