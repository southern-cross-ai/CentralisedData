        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister confirm that the Indonesian government has effectively halved the quota for both live cattle and boxed beef exported from Australia over the last 12 months, and that it is now imposing a five per cent import tariff on all cattle from Australia and demanding a pedigree certificate for all commercial breeding stock sent to Indonesia? Will the minister admit that these trade restrictions are as a direct result of him suspending the shipment of live cattle to Indonesia last year, and will he advise what action the Australian government is taking to restore this critically important trade in both live cattle and boxed meat with our nearest trading partner?

         I thank Senator Back for his question.

         say that Australia has a strong relationship with Indonesia, and our governments continue to work together. In July, I travelled to Darwin to take part in a meeting with the Indonesian government, as part of a wider Australian government delegation to discuss the broader bilateral relationship. I also joined the members of the Indonesian government delegation, led by President Yudhoyono, at a lunch hosted by the Australia Indonesia Business Council. While in Darwin I also met with the agricultural industry to discuss trade with Indonesia and domestic opportunities across a number of agricultural commodities, including the live cattle trade. Market access issues were raised and were high on the agenda, as was the call from the Indonesians for domestic investment from the Australian industry. The Australian government encourages mutually beneficial investment in the Indonesian agricultural sector, and that strengthens the bilateral arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Turning to the specific issues raised about cattle consignments,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">
          DAFF
         </a>
         is aware that at least one consignment of Australian breeder cattle has not been released to the Indonesian importers by Indonesian authorities, and the department understands that the Indonesian authorities are seeking clarification of the pedigree of these animals. The Australian government has not been notified of any changes to Indonesia's requirements for information about the pedigree of imported breeder cattle. The Australian government does not certify the pedigree of breeder cattle for the Indonesian market. These are directly commercial matters. The government is consulting with the Australian livestock exporters on the issue and will make appropriate representations to the Indonesian government if necessary. In terms of the live cattle import tariffs, I am aware of industry concerns.

          , I have a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of reports that Indonesian government ministers have stated they now intend to import beef and buffalo meat from so-called foot-and-mouth-disease-free zones in affected countries such as Brazil and from India whose herds are endemic for foot-and-mouth disease? Can he explain what measures he is taking to prevent such action, given the high risk of diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and meat-borne diseases affecting humans which will reach Indonesia and possibly Australia?

             The Australian live export trade to Indonesia and other markets continues to support jobs, families and communities right across regional Australia. The government's reforms place animal welfare at the heart of the live export trade. This new system does provide to the supply chain with a range of support for the control of the animals that leave Australia for foreign markets. We have a system in place that identifies us, to ensure that we have secure supply chains. Those opposite are arguing against a secure supply chain. What they want is poor animal welfare outcomes.

              , I have a second supplementary question. This is a secure supply chain. Will the minister confirm that Indian buffalo meat is being packaged and labelled as 'product of Australia' then sold illegally into Indonesia, and that the catalyst for this highly damaging trade is in direct response to the doubling and even trebling of beef prices in Indonesian villages due to the cut in supply of beef from Australia due to the minister's actions?

               Again, Senator Back wants to dwell on a scare campaign. If he has any evidence of this then he should provide it to the relevant authorities. What is important to recognise is that this government continues to support the live animal export industry. We continue to ensure that it manages its animal welfare issues.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those opposite want to ignore that. Those opposite would ensure that poor animal welfare outcomes would result. They would ensure that the trade would not have a bright future. They would make sure that the industry would not be able to have an animal welfare outcome, and that is the position that the opposition have taken. Of course, one of the animal welfare outcomes that the opposition want to do is take away the supply chain, and they want to ensure that the supply chain does not ensure that animal welfare outcomes are dealt with. All they want to do is harp on with the negative scare campaign on this industry.
