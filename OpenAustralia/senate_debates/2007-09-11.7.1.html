        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I refer the minister to a letter from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Racing_Board" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Racing Board
        </a>
        to former minister for agriculture Mr Truss dated 24 September 2004. Can the minister confirm that in this letter the board raises serious concerns about the quarantine risk of using private vets to inspect imported horses? Is it true that Mr Truss assured the Australian Racing Board that all imported horses would be under the direct control of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQIS" rel="nofollow">
         AQIS
        </a>
        vet? Can the minister now confirm that, despite this assurance, a number of horses that entered Australia through Melbourne airport after January 2005 were only checked by private practitioners employed by the importer, with no supervising AQIS vets present?

         We are talking here about an industry that is worth about $3.6 billion to the Australian economy and has about 10,000 commercial horses involved in it. It is a very important employer for rural and regional areas in particular. Everybody knows that we have had an outbreak of equine influenza in this country. Everybody also should know that we have acted very expeditiously in this regard and appointed Mr Callinan to oversee an inquiry into it. I suggest to Senator O’Brien that he take a deep breath and wait and see what that report indicates. If Senator O’Brien has all the answers and knows exactly how equine influenza got into Australia and knows all those responsible, can I suggest to him that he give the benefit of his evidence to the Callinan inquiry. That is the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the Victorian racing industry, I do know that they have made representations to the government that some of our quarantine restrictions have, in fact, been a bit too tough from time to time.

           Are you supporting them or aren’t you, Senator Sterle? They should be tough. I fully agree with you, Senator Sterle. That same industry body that your frontbencher seeks to quote has been critical. If Senator O’Brien were honest with the Senate, if my memory serves me correctly I think that letter related to foot-and-mouth disease and was not in relation to the particularities of equine influenza. I stand to be corrected in the supplementary question in relation to that, but I do not think I will be. So is it a serious issue? Of course it is. We have put—

                        The sorts of interjections that the people of Australia were able to witness from the Labor Party whilst the Labor Party senator was seeking to ask a question shows that they do not take this matter seriously and with the degree of concern that those involved in the racing industry would want them to take in relation to this matter. Regarding the letter, I am sure that the heading on the letter does say that it is, in fact, in relation to foot-and-mouth, and it is interesting that Senator O’Brien was not able to contradict that.

                            . Isn’t it nice when the Labor Party actually stop to listen? If they were to stop to listen, they would listen to their own state Labor ministers in relation to this matter.
