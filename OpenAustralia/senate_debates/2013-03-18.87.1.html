        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Wong. The present Labor administration has delivered five budgets covering the financial years 2008-09, 09-10, 10-11, 11-12 and 12-13. Can the minister advise the Senate—

           I am sure the senator could easily jump on the Treasury website and have a look at past budgets. All of this information is on the public record. But I would make the point that the senator seems, as the opposition often do, to have forgotten a thing called the global financial crisis. It is quite extraordinary the way those opposite seem to airbrush that.

             I will take the interjection from the Leader of the Opposition. How can this be relevant? Why don't you go to Washington and say, 'How can this be relevant?' Why don't you go to Brussels and say, 'How can this be relevant?' This is ridiculous.

               , on the point of order: of course the answer the minister is giving is relevant to this question. She is providing very relevant context to any question around our economic standing and, indeed, our position with respect to a surplus.

                   Fiscal strategy is relevant to budget, Senator. That might be news to you, but the fact that the government had to alter its fiscal strategy to respond to the global financial crisis is entirely relevant to this question and entirely relevant to the jobs which have been created, the jobs which have been saved and the growth which has been maintained as a result of those fiscal decisions. Those opposite might want to jump up and take pathetic points of order to try to make themselves look like they are part of a schoolboy debating team—I use 'schoolboy' advisedly until Senator Fierravanti-Wells might stand up!—but it demonstrates their complete lack of understanding of what this economy faced during the global financial crisis—

                      , I rise on a point of order on the question of relevance. This was the only question: can the minister advise the Senate how many of this government's budgets forecast surpluses at the time of their presentation to the parliament? You did a few seconds ago ask the minister to come to the question. She entirely ignored you. She has got 15 seconds left of the time available to her. She has had plenty of context. Now can she answer the question? How many budgets forecast a surplus?

                       , on the point of order: Senator Wong is giving a comprehensive response, not a little twee 'give us one word, yes or no', not a little twee 'give us the answer that we want'. Senator Wong is comprehensively debunking the question that she has been asked, and I ask you to rule there is no point of order.

                        Order! Senator Brandis was quite correct: three seconds ago I did draw the minister's attention to the question and the minister still has 15 seconds. I do draw the minister's attention to the question. I cannot tell the minister how to answer the question, though. That is something I cannot do. Minister, you have 15 seconds.

                           As the senator knows, this government has steered the Australian economy through a global financial crisis. That did include putting stimulus into the economy. If those opposite want to oppose that, they can explain to Australians why they think more people unemployed and an economy in recession is good economic management. They can explain that to Australians, because it is absurd.

                                       What those opposite are, in fact, arguing is that the government should not have put stimulus in the economy, the government should not have saved jobs, the government should have put 200,000 people and their families on the unemployment scrapheap and the government should have put the economy into recession. That is the Liberals' economic plan: let us put the economy into recession and let us put people on the economic scrapheap. That is not the Labor way. We are for jobs and we are for growth.
