        by leave—I want to make a brief statement to the Senate on the medical condition of the seven soldiers wounded in yesterday’s helicopter crash in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Senate is aware, tragically, three Australian commandos from the Special Operations Task Group were killed yesterday. Seven were wounded in the incident involving the crash of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
         ISAF
        </a>
        helicopter in southern Afghanistan in the early hours of yesterday morning.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States" rel="nofollow">
         The United States
        </a>
        has confirmed one of their personnel was killed and three other ISAF soldiers were also wounded. An ISAF civilian interpreter travelling with the Australian element was also injured.
       </p>
       <p>
        The types of injuries sustained by the Australians include fractures, lacerations, crush injuries and a head injury. Of the seven wounded Australian soldiers the most recent assessment is that two are in a very serious condition, and one of those soldiers has sustained a serious head injury. Five soldiers are now listed as being in a satisfactory condition. Six of the seven soldiers have undergone surgery. The two soldiers in a very serious condition are in intensive care, and all are in the Kandahar medical facility. No decision has yet been made as to when any of the injured soldiers might be moved to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landstuhl_Regional_Medical_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Landstuhl Regional Medical Centre
        </a>
        in Germany, but of course it will not take place until their condition allows the move to be undertaken.
       </p>
       <p>
        The names of the fallen soldiers have not yet been released. They will be released after Defence has approval from all the families involved. As everyone knows this is a terrible time for them and we do need to respect their privacy. The names of the wounded soldiers cannot be released as they are

        and, of course, have protected identity status.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Senate is aware, the casualties occurred when the aircraft crashed heavily to the ground. The specific cause of the incident is yet to be determined, and it is inappropriate to speculate until the investigation into the matter has been completed. It remains the case that this incident was not caused by insurgent action. The

         by leave—I thank Senator Faulkner for informing the Senate about this tragedy which has overtaken so many Australians, an American and an Afghani in the war in Afghanistan. I add, simply, a word—which I know all in the Senate and the people of Australia agree with—of sympathy, empathy and heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and working comrades of the Australians who have lost their lives or who were injured. They are there in the service of this nation; they are courageous Australians, and our thoughts are with all of them.

           by leave—Unfortunately, at the time of the condolence motion last night the National Party were in a meeting and were at that point unaware of the condolence motion. It goes without saying that we concur with the remarks of Senator Faulkner and thank him very much for the information. We also concur with the remarks that were given by the Liberal Party. Obviously, we hope and pray for the speedy recovery of those who were injured and our thoughts and prayers are also very much with those who have fallen. The National Party will also be writing letters to them, as we do.
