            , as I said last week, we are still forecasting modest growth and modest surpluses. But as I also said, at the time of MYEFO and the budget, we recognised that the risks here were to the downside. It is written there in black and white, clearly. Check out the risks section.

              I said the budget: MYEFO and the budget. As much as those opposite appear not to want to accept it, we are facing unprecedented uncertainty in the global economy. The rapid deterioration in the global economy has seen both the

              and the

              revise down their global growth forecasts in the past month. If global conditions continue to worsen, as they have been over the past month, I have already indicated to the Senate that there will be a further slowing of growth in the Australian economy.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government will always be upfront with the Australian community about the global challenges we face and their impacts here. As the Prime Minister has said, the global financial crisis continues to evolve in unpredictable ways and it is impossible to predict the future with absolute precision. That is why we remain prepared to take whatever action is necessary to support growth and to support jobs. The Leader of the Opposition might be prepared to sacrifice Australian jobs to make a political point. He may be prepared to do that, but we on this side will never sit on our hands if action is necessary to protect local jobs from this global crisis and global recession.

                     is misplaced. What Senator Conroy was doing was answering the question in terms of being able to provide specific information to the opposition about the question. The difficulty always is, if a wrong proposition is put forward and the government is asked to confirm or deny one or the other of the sides, it becomes impossible to do that when the question itself is flawed. In this instance, I would ask you to submit that Senator Conroy is answering the question to the best of his ability and as accurately as he can.

                              , but I would like to speak on the point of relevance, which is that Senator McGauran is trying to make a point of relevance on the original question he asked, not on the second supplementary—which was not what he referred to in his point of order. Senator McGauran ought to read his notes again, because I think he got a little mucked up, and the second supplementary did not go to the questions he raised in his alleged point of relevance. So there is no point of order, and I suggest that Senator McGauran pay closer attention to the notes that Senator Abetz provides him with.

                                As I was saying, the stream of consciousness that was just put forward actually contained little accuracy and little substance. So it will be very hard to be directly relevant to such a stream of nonsense. Those quotes that they continue to assert are contradictory are not contradictory. The fact is that those opposite are completely bereft of an understanding of fundamental economics. All I can say—and Mitch is not even here to hear this—is: give poor Senator Fifield a go at writing these questions, because you might then find somebody who understands something about economics. The whole premise of the question is false.
