        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone. Will the minister update the Senate on the results of inquiries made into the temporary skilled migration issues?

         I thank Senator Bernardi for the question. Senator Bernardi understands that yesterday in this place there were matters raised in relation to the 457 visa, which is a temporary skilled migrant visa—otherwise described by the now nearly racist Labor Party as a ‘foreign workers visa’ with workers coming in to take the jobs of your children.

              I did not rule on it. I made the point that the minister used a term that may be seen as unparliamentary collectively rather than individually. It is when it is directed individually that she would have to withdraw it. I did ask the minister to choose her language carefully, which she has accepted.

               Yesterday I was asked:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Can the minister confirm information from her department on occupations filled by 457 visa holders that 43 waiters, 77 domestic housekeepers, 251 personal assistants and 1,594 elementary clerical workers entered Australia on the visa last year?
              </p>
              <p>
               As a consequence of that, I asked Senator Evans, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
                Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
               </a>
               : ‘What are you talking about? Are you talking about visas granted? Are you talking about workers? Are you talking about flow? Are you talking about stock?’ The answer I got was: ‘It’s off your website.’ So I undertook to have a look at it. No wonder I got a bemused look from Senator Evans: he had none of the above. He actually had some sort of flow data which shows how many people with a 457 visa have come in and gone out of Australia in any one year. They may have come in and out two or three times on a holiday. They are not necessarily the workers. They might be the wives and they might be the children. So they are the workers, the families and the children crossing the border in 2005.

                  Included on the list given to Senator Evans’s office was 14,001 non-working children who were on the visa. Why? Because workers are allowed to bring their children in. But, wait, there is more! At the bottom of the last page of the material provided to Senator Evans there is in bold print and in capital letters: ‘Figures marked with an asterisk are subject to sampling variability’—because this is a sample—‘too high for most practical purposes.’ Seven of the eight occupations selected by Senator Evans had the asterisk. So we have a leader of the opposition in the Senate who does not know what he is using. Furthermore, when he uses something and it has an asterisk that says, ‘Watch out, this is unreliable’, he chooses to use the unreliable data. But, wait, there is more! Remember that it was said by the job snobs opposite, ‘You’re letting in caravan park attendants’—and shame on you if you have a job as a caravan park attendant! We know where the shame now lies. Caravan park attendants and workers are not on the list. It would seem that, when it says ‘caravan park managers’ and you do not like it, you change it.

                                      , yes, I heard the question, but I must say that I thought it was a point of order being raised, because Senator Bernardi wanted to jump and did not get the call. I assumed you took Senator Evans because you thought it was a point of order. But it does not matter; I will answer the question. To answer the question as to whether the document from which he was quoting yesterday was headed that, yes, it is.

                                        Yes, it is. The point being made, however, is that, when you get a document which is headed with something, you usually say, ‘What does that mean?’ When you see an asterisk at the bottom and you see that it says, ‘Contains figures which are subject to sampling variability; too high for most practical purposes,’ you usually say to someone, ‘Could you tell me what this means?’
                                       </p>

                                        I will tell you what it means. This means that, of all the people who hold 457 visas in any one year, who might come in and out—there might be a number of years of 457 visas here—and who are travelling for one purpose or another, there is some sampling done. That is what that information at the bottom means. You understand what sampling means. There is some sampling done with passenger information cards. On passenger information cards people write down their occupations. It would be no surprise to me if the partner of a 457 worker had put ‘Home duties’. It would be no surprise to me at all. It is perfectly acceptable for people to take those sorts of jobs. What this document shows you, Senator Evans, if you had bothered to ask—

                                           , Senator Evans, once given the document, should have bothered to ask of his staff: ‘What is this about? I want to ask a question on this. I want to go into the Senate and make an accusation on the basis of this, so can you please explain to me what this is?’ Instead of that, Senator Evans came in and asserted that this data is something other than what it is. This is not an indication of the principal applicants who have come in in any one year. It is not that. It is an estimate based on flow data derived from passenger cards. That is what it is.

                                            I did hear some yelling from the other side that we would not give them the data and we would not tell them what came in. I can tell you this: in the 2005-06 visa grants to principal applicants—and if Senator Evans wants to be the leader, he has to know what question to ask; he cannot come in with data that he does not understand, ask a question about it and expect to get an answer that is meaningful when he does not understand the data—the occupation that came in in highest number was that of registered nurse, and 2,530 of them came in. Computing professionals came in. There were 2,270. There were business and information professionals—1,430; general medical practitioners—980; and chefs—960. On it goes.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            If the opposition want to ask what visas have been given to principal applicants then that is the question they should ask in order to get the information. What they cannot do is come in with data that they simply do not understand and assert that these people are the primary applicants that are brought in for the purpose of working. Of course, it is true that someone’s spouse is entitled to a job, and they may not work in the most highly skilled areas. But, more particularly, any leader ought to know, when there is an asterisk that says, ‘Take care,’ that that is what you ought to do.

                                            I am tempted to misuse data myself. In 1996 some parliamentarians were on this list. They must have come in as spouses. You might think, ‘What was the skills shortage there?’ There is a skills shortage in a leader who understands the question.

                                             , I ask a supplementary question. I point out that one of the families that came in was the Wright family. The minister has been asked these questions before in estimates and on notice. Yesterday I asked her if she could confirm the information on that list. If the minister claims that the information on that list is not representative then I do not know why her department produced it. Can the minister tell us today exactly how many people let into the country in 2004-05 under the so-called skilled 457 visas were caravan park workers, personal assistants, housekeepers, ticket sellers and waiters? How is it that they came in under that visa given that those categories were not listed as being skills shortages in this country?
