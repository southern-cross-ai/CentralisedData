        implements a number of streamlining and integrity measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 1 to the Bill extends existing third-party reporting requirements to operators of electronic platforms. Platform operators will be required to report to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        information regarding certain transactions that occur on their platforms, such as seller identification and payment details. This information will assist the ATO in its administration of the tax system and ensure sellers on these platforms are meeting their tax obligations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These platforms are commonly used in what is known as the sharing or gig economy and provide a range of innovative opportunities for earning an income. As Australia's sharing economy continues to grow, a transparency gap has emerged as existing tax reporting requirements do not adequately capture information about transactions in this part of the economy.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 also introduces a rule-making power to the AFCA Act, to allow the Minister to prescribe matters of a transitional nature that may be required to facilitate the closure of the SCT.

       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 3 to the Bill amends the
        <i>
         Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

        , to remove the exclusion of the first $250 of deductions for prescribed courses of education.

        These amendments will reduce compliance costs for individuals claiming self-education expense deductions.
