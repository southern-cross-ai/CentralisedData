        Did you know that every minute of every day across Australia a child is going into hospital? Our children in Australia sometimes find that not to be the best of experiences. Sometimes it can be okay, thanks to organisations like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlight_Children's_Foundation" rel="nofollow">

        Australia, which has given opportunities to families in hospitals across the country. This month they're holding the Super Swim Challenge to raise funds to assist the work that they do to make life that little bit better for children in hospital, wherever they may be.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , over 60 communities in some of the most remote places, from the Central Desert all the way up to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">
         Top End
        </a>
        , are visited by the Starlight Children's Foundation. Starlight captains trek to remote communities with doctors and nurses, and join them in local clinics to help engage with and interact with the local children. They learn about cultural practices in some of the areas, and some of the languages as well. I know it's really good for some of the Starlight captains. Kids are often keen to come to community clinics knowing that the Starlight captains are around. I bring it to the attention of the Senate that this month in particular is a fundraising month for the Starlight Children's Foundation across Australia. If you're keen—as I have been; I've put my hand up to swim for the Starlight Children's Foundation—you're very welcome to go to my webpage and see if you can donate to them. It's about caring for all kids across Australia, to make their experiences in hospital a little bit better—especially for the children themselves but also for their families. Please, sponsor me in my swim.
