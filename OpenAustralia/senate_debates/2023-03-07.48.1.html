        Two hours ago I walked out onto the lawns of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and met with hundreds of my fellow Australians who don't have all the privileges that we in this place usually take for granted. The people on the lawns were angryâ€”they felt powerless, and they felt that no-one cared about or was listening to them. They were people who have sought asylum here in Australia, risking their lives to free themselves from oppressive regimes in places such as Afghanistan, Iran, Syria. Most had been locked up here in Australia or offshore for many years just for exercising their right to seek refuge. Many have had fast-tracked visa applications rejected unfairly, and now they exist on temporary or bridging visas, with children not permitted to attend university, some not able to access Medicare, not able to bring their ageing parents to join them here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Karima from Melbourne said to me that she and her family had been in limbo for the past 11 years and have never felt settled in this country that they wish to call home. They feel betrayed by the government. Some shared photos they'd taken with a smiling Andrew Giles soon after the election. And despite some changes promised by the government, 10 months on thousands of people are continuing to live in so much pain.
       </p>
       <p>
        I promised them that I would continue to speak out on their behalf, for speedy processing of their visas, for their rights to study, to work, to health care and to bring their ageing parents here to be with them. Above all I call on the government to listen to and to treat the families I met this morning with care and humanity as fellow human beings, rather than political problems. To Karima, Hayder, Hussein, Rocyia, Zainab, Ibrahim and everyone I met morning I say: I care, the Greens care, and we will keep fighting for you until justice is achieved for you.
