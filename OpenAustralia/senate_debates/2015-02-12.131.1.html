         thank Senator Fawcett for the question and acknowledge his deep and abiding interest in the Centenary of Anzac. The Australian government is very grateful for the contribution of corporate Australia towards the Centenary of Anzac. With the generous support of companies such as the

         On 27 January this year, I was very pleased to join Qantas
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         Alan Joyce to talk about that company's commitment to the Centenary of Anzac. Two of Qantas's founding fathers,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Fysh" rel="nofollow">
          Hudson Fysh
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McGinness" rel="nofollow">
          Paul McGinness
         </a>
         , both fought at Gallipoli, and so it is entirely fitting that this airline, the second oldest in the world, is an active participant in the national period of commemoration. Last year I announced that the widows of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          First World War
         </a>
         veterans would be invited, as guests of the Australian government and the Australian people, to travel to Gallipoli to attend Anzac Day, and Qantas has very generously offered to fly these very special women to Turkey to attend the commemoration. They will fly in a specially chartered Qantas jet. It will be easily recognisable, because it will be the only part of the fleet to carry the Centenary of Anzac logo at this stage. Qantas, on its international and domestic flights, will also play a series of vignettes about the Centenary of Anzac and sharing stories about our centenary of service.

           Again can I thank Senator Fawcett for the question.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
            If I
           </a>
           can just finish off on that previous answer, the Australian government and the Australian people are very grateful to Qantas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Last year, on behalf of the Prime Minister, I wrote to all the surviving widows of our Gallipoli veterans—who at that time numbered about 140, which is a quite remarkable number—and invited them to be guests of the Australian people and the Australian government at Anzac Day this year. Up to 10 of these ladies, along with a carer, have accepted the offer and, subject to their health and wellbeing being okay in April, they will go to Turkey.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is interesting that Qantas, as I said before, provided support to the remaining veterans in 1990, on the 75th anniversary of the Anzac commemorations, and now they are providing similar assistance to the widows of those men this year. They will fly these ladies to Turkey, where they will fully participate in all Anzac Day commemorative events, including the Dawn Service.

             100, which will go from Australia to Turkey. I will be writing this week, or early next week, to a further 270 Australians, inviting them to go to Gallipoli. They are the rotating part of the ballot. People have said they are not going, so we are continuing to provide Australians with the opportunity to go to this fantastic commemorative event.

Can I also say to those who are planning to go overseas for commemorative events—whether to Villers-Bretonneux, to Gallipoli or elsewhere—that they should make bookings now, and can I again reinforce, please, for everyone who is travelling overseas, particularly for these commemorative events, to register their details with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Smartraveller service.
