         , I rise on a point of order. The senator ought to ask her question anyway. It is directed specifically to Senator Santoro, and I gather he is entering the chamber now. Better late than never.

          My question is to Senator Santoro. Does the minister recall saying last week that he would conduct an investigation into the allegations of abuse at the George Vowell centre ‘during the next few days’, and saying, ‘I intend to be very open about this whole process’? Has the minister’s investigation examined why no action was taken after relatives wrote to the department, complaining about neglect at this facility in May 2005, other than to write back and request that the complaint be made formal? Under the Aged Care Act, isn’t it possible to investigate anonymous or informal complaints or refer them to the standards agency? Why wasn’t this done, given the serious nature of the issues raised in the complaint? Given the minister has stated that the failure to follow up this complaint was either a failure or deficient attention, will he now be very open as to why it occurred?

           I thank Senator McLucas for her question. I reject outright any suggestion that I or, in fact, my department have failed to investigate, as I committed that we would do, the allegations of lack of response or lack of proper and timely response. Senator McLucas should be very careful in tackling this particular issue because it is not an issue that we would want to politicise. As I said repeatedly during many media conferences, we all have grandmothers and grandfathers and we all have relatives in nursing homes who deserve and, in the main, right throughout Australia, receive the very best attention that our publicly funded aged care facilities can provide. I caution Senator McLucas not to become political on issues such as this. On the rare occasions when this sort of abuse occurs, it is required to be treated very sensitively.
          </p>
          <p>
           I can assure the Senate what I assured Senator McLucas would be the case—that is, I asked for an immediate investigation to take place. That investigation is taking place. I have been advised that it will be concluded by the end of this week, and at that point in time I will do whatever I can to make the public aware of those details. More importantly, when after the end of this week the Senate resumes in three weeks time, I will come back to the Senate and I will inform the Senate on this matter, bearing in mind that there are also very delicate privacy considerations included in this particular issue. I will be very forthcoming and open, as I said to Senator McLucas I would.
          </p>
          <p>
           What I am saying to the Senate and to Senator McLucas, through you,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
            Mr President
           </a>
           , is that the commitment I made is being maintained. I was advised just before I came into question time that the investigation is taking place. You can try to beat it up as much as you wish, but you have my assurance, and I strongly recommend that you try to depoliticise this issue because it is not one that lends itself to cheap politics.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister have full confidence in his department and the government’s aged care accreditation and complaints resolution system and how they have responded to this case?

             I believe that the department I am overseeing is made up of well-meaning and competent people who do their best to service a part of our community which requires proper and constant care. As I have said to Senator McLucas, and as I have sought to reassure the Australian public, there are obviously areas, whether they are in the department that I am responsible for or any other department, where improvements can constantly be made. The undertaking that I have made repeatedly through a series of interviews and a series of assurances is that, where I believe that finetuning is required, where an inquiry is required and where action is required after that inquiry, that will happen. That is an assurance that is rock solid. Senator McLucas, I suggest, with respect, should be reassured by that.
