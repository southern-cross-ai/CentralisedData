                      This is the chaotic approach the government is applying. We don't have the motion circulated around the chamber, as would be the usual courtesy, so it's been a little hard to follow precisely which rushed tactics the government is deploying to try to avoid letting the coalition even speak to our motion. What we are seeing from this government is a chaotic approach. In terms of the proposal from Senator Gallagher, what I heard her move—

                          President, can I ask you to step us through the motions that have been passed by this chamber to date. There was certainly nothing at the end of what Senator Gallagher said before that said the words 'and I move that the question be now put'. That was not what Senator Gallagher said in the motion she just put before. She moved a motion. The motion itself entailed no debate if that motion was successful, but there was nothing in the content of that motion that sought to close debate on that specific motion put forward.

                                President, I asked you before, out of respect for this chamber, in courtesy, in terms of understanding the precise rushed procedure of the government, to step us through the question before the chair but also the motions that have been passed through, for clarity about whether or not, indeed, the rush to put this question without any debate is an accurate reflection of the will of the chamber. Can you please repeat, for the benefit of the Senate, the question before the chair and what is leading to your rule of the guillotine applying?

                                 I will certainly do that, and I will do it with silence across the chamber. The minister sought leave; that was put. The motion was then put. The minister then moved the motion be put on calling on motion No. 1; that was put. That motion was then moved. The minister then moved the substantive motion, which is: 'Pursuant to contingent notice, I move that so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to provide that a motion relating to the consideration of Business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 may be moved immediately and determined without amendment or debate, and I move that the question now be put.' You then jumped to your feet and began to debate.

                                  On a point of order, President, I thank you for stepping through that. I appreciate, President, that you have a copy of the usual dit that's circulated in the chamber in front of you, as does Senator Gallagher. That dit has in it the words, 'And I move that the question be now put,' which sit separately. However, President, I did not hear those words said by the minister. So, President, I would encourage you to defer consideration of this matter to review precisely what occurred because my understanding is that the minister concluded—indeed, I've now got a copy of the same document you've got—before the red text. She read the black text, which was the motion that you went through, and stopped before saying the words, 'And I move that the question be now put.' In that case, the motion is eligible for debate, as moved by the minister. I would ask you to allow that motion to be debated, given the minister did not move that it be put.

                                          will show that what the minister moved was instead that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 be called on immediately and determined without amendment or debate. That is all that the minister said. She did not say at the conclusion of that, 'And that the question be now put.' It was on that basis that I was seeking the call at that time, but right now we are in the midst of the bells ringing for a division on a motion you have called that I believe has already been determined by the Senate.

                                            In order to ensure the Senate is clear, as I understand it the motion that is being called on is the minister's motion that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 be called on immediately and determined without amendment or debate. Is that right?

                                                   I beg your pardon. Sorry. The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 be called on immediately and determined without amendment or debate.
