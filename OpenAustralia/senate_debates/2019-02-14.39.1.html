       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) whether the way in which banks and other financial service providers have used the legal system to resolve disputes with consumers and small businesses has reflected fairness and proportionality, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) whether banks and other financial service providers have used the legal system to pressure customers into accepting settlements that did not reflect their legal rights,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) whether banks and other financial service providers have pursued legal claims against customers despite being aware of misconduct by their own officers or employees that may mitigate those claims, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) whether banks generally have behaved in a way that meets community standards when dealing with consumers trying to exercise their legal rights;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the accessibility and appropriateness of the court system as a forum to resolve these disputes fairly, including:

        (iii) whether AFCA faces proper accountability measures, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

           It was this government that called the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Commission
           </a>
           into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. It was this government which responded within four days of receiving the final report and committed to taking action on all 76 recommendations. In a number of important areas we're going further. We have committed to expanding the remit of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority for a period of 12 months to accept applications for disputes dating back to 1 January 2008, the period covered by the royal commission, for disputes that fall within
