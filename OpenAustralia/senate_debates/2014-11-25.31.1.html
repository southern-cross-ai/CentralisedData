        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, Senator Cash. Today we have seen the results of the first year of data collected by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, and it paints a sorry picture about the representation of women in senior positions in the workforce. Only one-quarter of senior managers are women, and just 17 per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        s are women. The gender pay gap is the worst it has been in decades. So why is this government trying to water down the reporting requirements on employers, which have just given us this data? Why is the government trying to hide the gender pay gap instead of fixing it?

         I thank Senator Waters for her question and for giving me the opportunity to highlight the policies that the government wishes to put in place. I have to say: Senator Waters, if you were able to commit the Greens today to supporting our paid parental leave scheme and the changes that we will be making to the childcare system, it would be a significant step forward in relation to addressing the gender wage gap in Australia.

           Senator Waters is correct. The data does show that women's representation is significantly lower at management levels and that this should be an area of continued focus in organisations. This government has always said that. The government has never shied away from the fact that there is a gender pay gap. What we have said is: it has been steadily rising now for a number of years. In fact, it was at its lowest under the former Howard government. Under the Rudd government, the Gillard government and the Rudd government, it continued to rise. Today—you are right—it is not at a level where we want to see it. But it is more than just standing in this chamber and complaining. It is saying to the Australian people: what policies can the government put forward?
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Waters, you have the power, in your capacity as the Greens spokesperson, to say to your senators: 'You should support'—if you are dinkum about actually making a change in relation to gender participation and the gender wage gap. I put to you, Senator Waters, that one of the changes we want to make to make to paid parental leave is to include superannuation. Women currently retire with 40 per cent less superannuation than men. Thirty per cent of women in Australia have no retirement income. A
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPL" rel="nofollow">
            PPL
           </a>
           scheme that does not include superannuation is a failed scheme.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Today's data also shows that 23 per cent of company directors are women, but in the federal cabinet there is only one woman out of 19—a pitiful five per cent. Only 17 per cent of the front bench is women. Even corporate Australia is beating you when it comes to women in leadership positions. When will this government lead by example and appoint more women to cabinet?

               The Australian public voted overwhelmingly for the coalition government. That is it. Senator Waters, it is not just about one thing that you get hung up on that is going to make a difference. This government is actively working with businesses throughout Australia to ensure that we create the policy framework in which businesses can operate to ensure that more women are able to move through the pipeline and are put into leadership positions. We provided $650,000 to the

               to ensure that 140 women in this country are able to undertake the

                Today is White Ribbon Day, which raises awareness of domestic violence. We know that gender inequality is an underlying cause of violence against women. So why is this government persisting with a cruel budget that will further entrench economic gender inequality with university debts, welfare cuts and tax changes that disproportionately affect women?

                 Senator Waters, this is a very, very serious issue. Your question, unfortunately, does you no justice
                </p>
                <p>
                 You are responsible for the debt and deficit this country is facing. You are responsible for taking this country, in 2007, from a fiscal situation where we had zero debt—we had money in the bank, we had a
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
                  Future Fund
                 </a>
                 and we were actually, as a government, making money on the money we had in the bank—to a fiscal situation six years later, Senator Waters, where we are facing every man, woman and child in Australia having '$25,000 in debt' tattooed on their head because of the policies that you supported. So, when you come into this place, at least be honest enough—
