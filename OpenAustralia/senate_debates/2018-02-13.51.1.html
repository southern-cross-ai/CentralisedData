        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Members of Parliament
        </a>
        (Staff) Act, associated directions and guidelines, and the Prime Minister's Statement of Ministerial Standards give the Prime Minister authority over the appointment of ministerial staff. Given that the minister yesterday told the Senate that ministerial staffing of Nationals offices is a matter for the National Party, what instrument or document delegates the Prime Minister's authority and to whom is it delegated?

         I thank Senator Farrell for that question. As I indicated to the Senate yesterday, both the office of the Prime Minister and, for that matter, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Finance
         </a>
         have an administrative role in relation to these appointments. In relation to the finance department, incidentally, that is an administrative role that they have in relation to all staff employed by members and senators, whether in government or in opposition. As far as the appointments of staff in Nationals ministers' offices and other Nationals members' offices are concerned, as I indicated yesterday, my advice is there is an overall allocation of staff—there's a staffing pool—that is allocated to Nationals ministers. These are decisions that are made by the National Party. As the Deputy Prime Minister advised in a statement again today, he did not discuss these matters with the Prime Minister or his office as Vikki was not his partner, so they were dealt with in the usual course of staff deployments and appointments within the National Party.

            Again, as I've said, the Nationals are responsible for decisions relating to staffing in the offices of Nationals members. The Prime Minister's office has an administrative role in informing the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">

                    . I reject the premise of the question. I've confirmed that the Prime Minister has an administrative role in informing the

                    Well, I've just indicated to you that the Prime Minister has an administrative role, which of course he fulfils. But the decisions in relation to employment arrangements for Nationals ministers are made by the National Party.

                      These are two separate questions. In relation to all members and senators—Mr Drum is a member of the House of Representatives—all of us select our staff. As I've indicated to you, there is a staffing pool that is allocated to the Nationals. My advice is that the Nationals at no time exceeded the staffing pool allocated to them. All of the appointments were made in the appropriate way, consistent with all of the legal and administrative requirements.

                       , I have a final supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that the Deputy Prime Minister's former media adviser was paid above the band? Who approved that payment?
