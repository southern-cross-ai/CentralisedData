        (Senator Watt) to a question without notice I asked today relating to immigration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Watt repeatedly failed to answer my first and second questions. When will the Labor government stop this unsustainable high immigration? It revealed Senator Watt's complete lack of care for the people of Australia, his dismissal of the people, his arrogance towards the people and his contempt for the real and serious issues facing Australians, such as the housing crisis, with the shortage and high cost of houses and rents; inflation due in part to increased immigration; and hiding the per capita recession. If it weren't for the record high arrivals in Australia we would be in recession right now. Cabinet is covering up the fact that its policies, including net zero, are raising energy prices exorbitantly and destroying manufacturing, security and tertiary processing—and Labor's big corporate mates are profiteering.
       </p>
       <p>
        Halfway through his government's term he's still blaming the previous government. That's all you've got, Senator Watt? And then he said falsely that I called immigrants terrorists. I did not do that. I would not do that. I was born in India. Minister Watt is clearly breaching standing orders by not being relevant and by impugning my motives. Senator Hanson was sitting beside me at the time, under the President's censure, yet Senator Watt gets off scot-free.

        The Albanese government is heading down the same dead-end road the Rudd government chose. I'll give you some quotes from the headlines of the

        : Albanese 'doesn't properly read important briefing documents'; 'S-show'—a four-letter word—'political chameleon' who wasn't prepared; a 'shemozzle' and decisions which have rocked the party to its core. How long before members of the government change from hearing negative statements about Prime Minister Albanese to actively working to oust him? The Albanese voice relied on the vibe, hiding the details and contradicting claims, and had an apparent belief that voice proponents could fool the people with emotion. Start treating the Senate and the people with respect. Be honest.
