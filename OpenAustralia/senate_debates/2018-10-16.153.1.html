        My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. At this moment, we have reports that Indonesia is considering suspending its imminent trade deal with Australia over the Prime Minister's announcement in relation to the move of Australia's embassy to Jerusalem. Can the minister please update the Senate on whether or not that is in fact the case?

         As indeed the Prime Minister and the foreign minister outlined in their statements earlier today, the government was proactive in its engagement with Indonesia. Our government remains committed to pursuit of the comprehensive strategic partnership with Indonesia and to delivery of the comprehensive economic partnership agreement with Indonesia. We know the importance of strong and effective engagement. We know that those opposite, when they were last in government, failed in their engagement with Indonesia, cutting off significant trade flows to Indonesia that disrupted the relationship. We are committed to continuing to build that relationship. The only significant threat that I am aware of to the comprehensive economic partnership agreement at present are the policies announced by the Labor Party that would seek to unpick that agreement and potentially block its ratification through this parliament.

            I have not seen the report that Senator Wong refers to. I'm not aware of the report and so I certainly cannot speak to any such report. I can restate, as I did before, that the only threat that I am aware of to the successful conclusion of negotiations around the comprehensive economic partnership agreement is the policies of those opposite, announced recently, in fact on the front page of today's
            <i>
             Financial Review
            </i>
            , which demonstrate that Labor would be incapable in government, it seems, of concluding and ratifying that agreement, because they have announced that they stand against aspects of that agreement that has been successfully negotiated by the Liberal-National government.

              Did the government receive any warnings or indication from Indonesia about any potential consequences for this or other aspects of the bilateral relationship with Australia as a consequence of the pending announcement in discussions with the Indonesians prior to the announcement by Mr Morrison today? Does the minister agree that this demonstrates yet again the risk that this Prime Minister has played with the national interest by making a decision in relation to bipartisan foreign policy positions in order to gain votes in Wentworth?

               Firstly, I reject the premise of the tail end of Senator Wong's question. Secondly, I would point Senator Wong to my answers to the preceding two questions, where I highlighted the fact that the Prime Minister and Minister Payne had addressed these matters in their answers to questioning earlier today and that I had highlighted before that the only threat to the ratification of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEPA" rel="nofollow">
                CEPA
               </a>
               that I'm aware of is the opposition by those opposite to the key components negotiated within CEPA. Indeed, in terms of taking lectures and advice about relations with Indonesia, we will not be taking lectures from those opposite, who of course brought the relationship with Indonesia to its knees with their ban of the live cattle trade. Those opposite—with no warning, no discussion, none of the type of proper consultation that you would expect—took a decision that directly impacted upon Indonesia, upon their food security, and that was a disaster at the time. It was a disaster that continues to hang over your head in terms of your capabilities on foreign and trade relations.
