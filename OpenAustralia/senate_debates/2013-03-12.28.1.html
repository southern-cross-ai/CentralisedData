        , Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to the government's decision last week to allow 19 applications for regional development funding from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Greater Western Sydney

         RDA
        </a>
        to proceed to full application status. All other RDA organisations in Australia have been permitted just three applications to proceed to full application status. Does the minister think it is fair that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        , an area that produces 40 per cent of Queensland's coal, is allowed just three applications when 19 applications from Western Sydney are allowed to proceed to full application status? Why does the government believed that the entertainment precinct of Parramatta is deserving of the term 'regional', just as Cunnamulla, Birdsville and Quilpie are considered regional? Why would the entertainment precinct of Parramatta go to the next stage of this application funding when the government has rejected the Tennant Creek Child Care Centre?

          I apologise; the press hounded me out of the room. I thank the senator for his question. The Gillard government has a strong record of delivering support to our regions. Our Regional Development Australia Fund of almost $1 billion supports Australia's regions and enhances the economic development and liveability of their communities. This government is building on the $4.3 billion investment announced in the 2011-12 budget by continuing to invest in regional health initiatives, education, liveability, skills and infrastructure in the 2012-13 budget. The government has established a $6 billion regional infrastructure fund to address critical infrastructure needs in areas supporting the mining industry, including $573 million allocated to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDA" rel="nofollow">
           RDA
          </a>
          F.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have committed to establishing a new RDA committee for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
           Greater Western Sydney
          </a>
          , home to two million people. Where Melbourne had four RDA committees, Sydney had one. Establishing a Greater Western Sydney RDA means that this region, which has a bigger population that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          , can more effectively identify projects that stack up and leverage partnership investments. The new Greater Western Sydney RDA will help unlock economic growth and improve liveability in the region. It will also strengthen the region's chance of securing investment through the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDAF" rel="nofollow">
           RDAF
          </a>
          . It is appropriate that all projects seeking funding are considered in the context of this new agreement.

           , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the fact that none of the regional grants so far from this fund have been made to areas in capital cities, which would make sense, because people would think that they were capital cities and urban areas, not regional areas. So why have regional projects such as the Cooktown foreshore development, the Gracemere water supply augmentation and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Richmond Shire Council
           </a>
           water treatment plant been knocked back when all the applications for Western Sydney have been allowed to proceed? Why is the government being so disingenuous with this on-the-run, cynical redefinition of the term 'regional' when what it should really be talking about is a growth area?

            Coming from the princes of pork-barrelling in that far corner, let me be very clear. We have Auditor-General report after Auditor-General report demonstrating how corrupt the processes of the former government were when it came to allocating regional development funds. Senator Joyce, don't come in here and think you can, with a remote sense of credibility, complain about a proper process which is being gone through when you have the track record of those regional rorts and those regional rorters that the Auditor-General so cruelly exposed so regularly.

Having broken a promise to the member for Denison on poker reforms, having broken a promise to all Australians on the carbon tax and having broken a promise to deliver a surplus on the economy, is the government now going to break a promise made to its own Independent allies?

Senator Joyce ran on a platform; he said it; he campaigned on it; he came in here and he talked a big fight. Then he got in the room and, as usual, the little puppy dogs in the Nationals rolled over and let Mr Howard tickle their tummies and off they went—
