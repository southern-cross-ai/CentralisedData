         I thank Senator Paterson for the question. Senator Paterson, you are right, that is the priority of the Morrison government, to support employers out there, to support businesses to prosper, to grow and to create more jobs for Australians. COVID-19 has had an absolutely devastating effect on businesses out there, but, because of the economic policies that the Morrison government put in place, we have seen the economy rebound. What we have seen is businesses utilising the policies that we have put in place to prosper, to grow; and, as we know, based on the employment figures—in particular, the most recent employment figures from May 2021—they are certainly creating more jobs for Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government doesn't create jobs, businesses do. Governments put in place the economic framework that businesses can utilise to prosper and grow, and, at this point in time, we are ahead of almost every other country in the world. We now have in Australia more people in employment than we did prior to COVID-19. That is a good thing and it is something we are proud of as a government. It is because of the policies that the government is putting in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have delivered record business confidence as a result of our government's economic measures. When you look at those economic measures, the budget's expansion of the full expensing measure has seen the strongest numbers in machinery and equipment investment in 17 years, the strongest numbers in machinery and equipment investment. That's because what we're saying to business is, 'If you have the capacity to invest in yourself, we will back you every step of the way, because we know that, when you invest in yourself, you grow the business and you employ more Australians.'

            Order! On my left. We're going to restart. You can take your seat, Senator Paterson. Order! Senator Watt. Senator Carr. If you don't interject you don't get retorts like that at the start of the question, even if they're not helpful. If the bait is not laid, it is not taken. Senator Paterson, I will recommence the clock.

              Red and green tape: what it does is stop businesses from taking on their first employee. Red and green tape: it stops businesses from prospering and growing. Red and green tape: it stops businesses from expanding their businesses, growing, and employing more Australians. That is why the Morrison government is focused on getting rid of as much unnecessary red and green tape as we can. We understand that you need to take the regulatory burden off businesses, off employers, so that they can unlock investment, grow their business and create more jobs.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the things we have achieved as a government is that we've made it easier for Australians to work across state borders. That is a good thing—in particular, when you look at tradies. Tradies on the

                 On this side of the chamber, the Morrison government's side of the chamber, we are focused on putting in place those policies which will ensure that businesses are able to prosper, grow, create more jobs for Australians and ensure the continued return of our economy. In terms of the biggest risk to supporting Australians, it is, of course, the imposition of higher taxes. You heard the Minister for Finance refer to what the Labor Party promised the Australian people when they last went to the election: $387 billion in higher taxes.

                 As we know, those opposite have never found a tax or a regulation that they haven't loved and haven't thought to put on business or on the Australian people. Well, on our side of the chamber, the Morrison government side of the chamber, we have it in our

                 to lower taxes, because we understand that it's your money and we need to give you back your money. Whether you are a business or whether you are a taxpaying Australian, you need to have in your pocket more of what you've worked for.
