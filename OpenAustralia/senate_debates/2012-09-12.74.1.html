          Does the Gillard government now recognise that the dodgy and ill-thought-out mining tax deal it negotiated exclusively and in secret with the three biggest miners, has provided a direct federal government incentive to state and territory governments around Australia to increase royalties on iron ore and coal?

           just could not help himself: 'It's all your fault, federal government!' He could not help himself when he cut 14,000 jobs. He could not help himself when he slashed health and when he cut education, and he could not help himself when he imposed what has been described as one of the biggest tax increases on the mining sector around the world. Now, of course, Senator Cormann, you might recall you have been in here on many occasions telling us about job losses that the mining tax and the carbon tax will impose. Have you listened to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto" rel="nofollow">

           ? 'This increase'——meaning Campbell Newman's increase—'will further endanger jobs and investment in the coal industry at both existing mines and new projects.' The Queensland Resources Council has said it will mean job losses.'

            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             It risks further mine closures and there are many coal projects on the drawing board that will now never get off that drawing board.
            </p>
            <p>
             But what do we hear from the great defenders of mining jobs over there? Not a single word. You are absolutely hypocritical. You are happy to stand up for so-called mythical job losses before they have occurred when they have not occurred, but you will not stand up for those people whose jobs are in the gun because of your coalition mates.

                  Isn't it extraordinary that Senator Cormann, the great defender of the mining sector, is not at all interested in that question nor in the one before about the impact on mining jobs in Queensland. I am not surprised you are getting up. You do not want to talk about it, do you? You are very sensitive when it comes to Liberal-imposed taxes.

                   , I rise on a point of order and that is the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant to the question. There was a very specific question asked and that was: what is the cost to the federal budget from these royalty increases in states around Australia because this government has made a promise to the big three miners to credit all state and territory royalties against their mining tax liability? It is a number. The only answer that can be directly relevant to the question is a number and, if the minister does not know it, she should take it on notice and sit down.

                     As I said before, it is interesting that those on the other side do not want to talk about the effect on employment of a Liberal royalty increase but they are happy to exaggerate and make false claims about the effect on jobs of a Labor government's policy. I will share this with the Senate in response to the question: this comment has been previously made—'increasing tax on mining will cripple Australia's most productive industry and anyone who does not think this will deter investment has got rocks in their head'. Who said that?

                       Given the minister did not get anywhere near answering that question, I ask it again. What is the impact on the federal budget bottom line of increases in royalties in states around Australia given Labor's promise to credit all their state royalties on iron ore and coal against the mining tax liability. Given the government is already confronted with a $120 billion budget black hole on the back of its latest spending spree, how does the government propose to plug this latest multi-billion dollar budget black hole of its own making?

                         , I have a point of order in relation to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant. How can comments on what may or may not be happening with the Queensland state budget be relevant to a question about the impact on the federal budget in relation to state royalty increases around Australia? I asked a specific question about the impact on the federal budget. The minister did not go anywhere near it. There is no way that you could possibly rule that she was being directly relevant to the question.

I await those opposite actually indicating that they do not agree with it because I would like them to be aware of this: an executive from one Queensland leading coalminer said yesterday about the
