        When we think about leadership, we often picture someone at the top of an organisation giving orders or making important decisions, but leadership is so much more than that. It's about responsibility and making a positive impact, no matter your position. For young women, leadership starts with self-belief. It's about having the confidence to trust your voice, your ideas and your instincts. In a world that sometimes tries to tell us what we can or cannot do, real leadership is knowing that your perspective matters. It's the courage to stand up for what you believe in, even when it's difficult or unpopular. It's about picking yourself up when you face setbacks and continuing to move forward with determination. Every challenge you overcome makes you stronger and more capable. Leaders learn, adapt and grow.

        That brings me to a remarkable initiative in my home state of Tasmania, one that nurtures the next generation of leaders, the Southern Tasmanian Netball Association Junior Leadership Program. Established in 1998, this program has seen well over 190 young members graduate, many of whom have gone on to take leadership roles within their clubs and the association itself. Earlier this month, at the STNA centre at Creek Road in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Town" rel="nofollow">
         New Town
        </a>
        , I had the privilege of addressing a group of these young leaders, aged up to 16, who are currently participating in the program. The topic of my talk was 'Women in leadership'. It was inspiring to see the level of engagement and passion these young women brought to the discussion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Junior Leadership Program equips participants with a diverse set of skills that go well beyond the netball courts. These include coaching, umpiring, health and nutrition, sports injury management, and mental health and wellbeing. The program also covers broader topics such as netball and the media, the importance of culture and, of course, women in leadership. This holistic approach ensures that these young leaders are well prepared for the challenges that they may face in their sporting, working and personal lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my presentation, I emphasised the importance of resilience, understanding and collaborationâ€”qualities that are essential for any leader, whether in sports, politics or any other field. I also set a fun, time-limited interactive leadership task designed to help the participants to show their ability to adapt and problem-solve and think about their own leadership style in practice and how they effectively work together.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most encouraging aspects of the Junior Leadership Program is its focus on practical experience. Participants are given the opportunity to help organise key events for the Southern Tasmanian Netball Association, including the Zambrero Premier League Grand Final Night and the STNA Winter Roster Grand Finals. These experiences are invaluable, providing young leaders with hands-on experience in event management and team coordination, skills that will serve them well in any future endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to highlight the program's commitment to celebrating the achievements of its participants. On 30 August these young leaders will gather for the Junior Presentation Night, where they will receive their graduation certificates. This is not just a formality; it is a moment of recognition for their hard work, dedication and growth throughout the program. The Southern Tasmanian Netball Association Junior Leadership Program is a shining example of how sport can be a powerful vehicle for leadership development. It is programs like this that help build the foundation for a stronger, more resilient community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to these young women: as you think about your own leadership journey, remember that you don't have to wait to be given a title or a formal role; you can lead in your everyday actions, whether it's supporting a friend, standing up for what's right or striving to make your community a better place. Leadership is within you, and it's about making a difference wherever you are. I'm incredibly proud to support this initiative and look forward to seeing the continued success of these young leaders as they take their next steps in life.
