         I thank Senator McMahon for her question and for her deep commitment to the ADF personnel who are stationed in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

         . Thank you.

        <p>
         I'm extremely proud that this government is showing the same commitment and duty to our ADF members, our veterans and their families as they themselves have shown to this nation. As highlighted in the recently announced suicide prevention measures, the issues we face—I know we face them together on a bipartisan basis—are numerous and complex. For example, transitioning from military service to civilian life can be for many a very challenging life event, and it does provide a period of uncertainty for many members and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 2017, Defence has put smart thinking and targeted resources behind its transition transformation program, and we believe that continual improvement is the key. As the minister, I'm committed to ensuring that Defence works closely with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Veterans' Affairs
         </a>
         to help our ADF members and their families in very practical and very positive ways to transition successfully from their service life to the next chapter of their lives in both their careers and their family lives. Defence has a suite of enhanced transition programs designed to prepare ADF members and their families to take responsibility for their own lives, welfare and development, which includes their health and wellbeing, social engagement, employment, education, accommodation and finances. We are also committed to ensuring that members have access to the right support at the right time, especially those who are vulnerable or at risk and—importantly, I think—that members are assessed individually and treated according to their own personal needs, whether it's in mental health care, patient care or occupational rehabilitation.

            Thank you again, Senator McMahon, for the question. Yes, I can confirm that Defence and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
             DVA
            </a>
            are working closely together—in fact, I believe, the most closely they have ever worked together—to provide at-risk transitioning veterans with a single point of contact to ensure their seamless support is ongoing, to ensure access to the appropriate health treatment and to help them finalise their own claims. Last week the government announced a significant funding boost to this coordinated program, with the addition of 170 veterans, particularly those from the most vulnerable age group, which is the 17-to-30 cohort. They will be supported as they transition into a civilian career. This means that 10 additional case coordinators will be backed by nearly $5 million in investment in a program that is already helping over 1,200 veterans facing challenging circumstances. A further investment of $5.6 million will assist another 1,600 ADF members.

               Thank you again, Senator McMahon. You are right: it is absolutely critical that we get this component correct. All of us here in this chamber and the government, and all Australians, owe it to the men and women who have served our nation and also to their families to give them the support that they have given us through their service and also their sacrifice as a family. As Australians, we demand the highest standards of our ADF men and women, and we have a responsibility to support them in all aspects of their professional and personal development, health and wellbeing, from the first day of their service through to their return to their civilian lives and their lives with their families. Transition planning should start, and is now starting, from their enlistment to start thinking about and preparing for the time that they transition back to a civilian life. This is why the government is so focused on ensuring that they have a successful transition and a long and happy life with their families and in their employment.
