        Almost a fortnight ago, I sat down with a roomful of Canberra's heroes—frontline service providers here in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        delivering desperately needed services to some of the most vulnerable in our community. For an hour and a half, we heard from more than two dozen people in the room, as everyone took turns reporting back on what they were seeing on the front line. Called 'Who's new on the streets', these bimonthly meetings are an important check-in and a way of coordinating scarce resources to meet growing demand. While everyone brings a unique perspective, some all too common themes emerged.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every single representative reported an increase in the incidence of family and domestic violence. Every single representative said there was nowhere left to send those fleeing violence and seeking a safe place to stay. Wait times for public housing are around four years, even for those with the most urgent need. Places in transitional housing are full, and funding for crisis accommodation has run out. I heard from staff at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Canberra Hospital
        </a>
        that they are seeking to keep women in hospital—to keep women on the ward—longer than medically necessary because they have nowhere safe to discharge them to. Here in one of the most affluent places in the country, we can't afford to put someone up for a night or two in emergency motel accommodation. The best hospital staff can offer women, children and others fleeing family and domestic violence is a couple of nights in the charity volunteer operated sleepbus.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have to do more, and I'm calling on the government to step in with additional funding for emergency services and accommodation. This is a joint responsibility of state, territory and federal governments, and we have to keep people in our community safe.
