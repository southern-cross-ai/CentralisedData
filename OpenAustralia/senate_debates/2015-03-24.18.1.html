         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question. Just last week, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU

         and its officials were found to have broken the law in the 2012 blockade of the Melbourne Grocon site. Victorian CFMEU Secretary Setka led the way. He ambushed the Grocon worker, punched the windscreen of his van, told him he would come after him and that he hoped he would die from his cancer. He also shoved a security manager down a laneway and, when the worker protested, threatened to shut him up permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
         Law-breaking is nothing new for Setka. On separate occasions he has been found guilty of assaulting police, violence against workers, threatening behaviour, intimidation, indecent language and wilful trespass. He has been convicted or fined for 40 offences and sentenced to jail twice. He was jailed for breaking into a worksite where he was banned, punching and kicking an employee, threatening another with a steel bar and throwing liquid at a security guard. All this from a person who professes you need him to ensure workplace safety!
        </p>
        <p>
         He was convicted of threatening a manager who was planning to give evidence against him in a tribunal. Now there is a reason to keep the compulsory powers. He was also fined for threatening behaviour and charged for obstruction and intimidation of a Commonwealth official. He demanded a worker be kicked off a work site because he was related to a manager Setka hated, saying, 'I'm gonna rip his head off and bury it next to

           There is a very concerning threat to the rule of law in the building industry. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
            CFMEU
           </a>
           is currently facing contempt of court proceedings, and there have been no less than five cases since 2001 in which the CFMEU was found guilty of contempt of court and heavily fined.
          </p>
          <p>
           These include fines of: $1.25 million in March last year; $150,000 in 2011; and, just last week, $125,000. This is all members' money. Yet the Federal Court found last week that the CFMEU did not offer any apology or express any contrition, nor did it advise the court that it had put in place arrangements with a view to ensuring that future undertakings were complied with. Anyone concerned about upholding the rule of law should be concerned about the current state of unlawfulness in the construction sector.

             Victorian Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Fontana told the royal commission of the links between unions and organised crime. He identified the police's concerns about corruption, drug trade, blackmail and extortion in the industry. He said that
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
              Victoria Police
             </a>
             intelligence indicates that 'criminal activity is undertaken by trade union officials directly', and that 'union officials use organised crime figures to act as debt collectors in the industry'. Counsel assisting asked: 'Which union undertakes these activities?' to which Assistant Commissioner Fontana replied: 'Certainly, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
              CFMEU
             </a>
             is one that comes to mind.' If anyone is curious as to the identity of those CFMEU officials referred to by Assistant Commissioner Fontana, I am sure that Mr Setka might be able to provide the answer.
