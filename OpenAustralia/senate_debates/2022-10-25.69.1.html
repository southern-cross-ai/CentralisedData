        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, on 22 January 2019
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese" rel="nofollow">
         Anthony Albanese
        </a>
        put out a press release titled 'Rockhampton Ring Road a certainty under Labor'. The Rockhampton Ring Road is the biggest infrastructure project in regional Queensland and it is already out to tender. Yesterday the ABC reported that the $800 million earmarked by the coalition for the ring-road project has been put off for a few years. Local businesses have contacted me and the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, furious about this broken promise by the Prime Minister. Mr Albanese's comment that it was a certainty had encouraged many local businesses to spend thousands of dollars on their tender applications. Minister, is the only certainty that Australians can bank on that this government will break its promises?

           Yes, avidly. I particularly liked you in your high-vis vest in your backyard. I thought that was great. It's clearly a very dangerous backyard you've got! I should have put that on when we were doing the kids' trampoline. It's a very risky backyard there. Anyway, I make these points. First, the government is committing—

               Obviously Senator Watt is more across this than I would be. I understand, in relation to that particular project, it is incorrect to assert that it is being cut. It is the case that those opposite, as was the habit of the Morrison government, made a lot of announcements without making sure that those announcements could actually be delivered. It is an extraordinary thing, isn't it, to have a government that actually wants to make sure that, when it announces projects, it is funding them in a way that can make sure—

                     I was trying to explain what was occurring in relation to the project in question. We have reviewed projects in the infrastructure program to better align investment with market capacity, consulting with the states and the territories through this process. This is what responsible governments do. I will be very clear: I understand that the $823 million for the Rockhampton Ring Road remains in the budget. It remains in the budget, but unlike the former government we're actually being upfront about project delivery time lines. That's the responsible thing to do.

                     Senator McKenzie, you can yell all you like, but an announcement is not delivery.

                       This next question is on behalf of those businesses, so it might be useful if the senator did not yell at them from here in Canberra. As I mentioned, those people—those mum-and-dad businesses—have spent thousands of dollars on the word of the now Prime Minister that this was a certainty. What do you propose they do now, Minister Wong, given they haven't been able to rely on the words of the Prime Minister?

It warned the former government there weren't enough construction tradies to fill the infrastructure pipeline. You ignored it. This is the problem with a government—

                           <p>
                            Maybe you should explain that to them, Senator Canavan. The reality is that the money remains in the budget for that project. There are over 700 regional budget commitments tonight, no matter the scare campaign from those opposite. The reality is, as with so much in the modern Liberal Party and modern National Party, they think that, when they announce something, they've delivered it.

                              You think that, when you've announced something, you've delivered it. The reality is: you couldn't deliver it, and you weren't actually interested in doing what you had to do to deliver it.

                                Minister, the Prime Minister has broken his promise to reduce power bills by $275 a year. He's broken his promise on methane emissions from cattle. And now he is breaking his promise to fund infrastructure. Why is the Prime Minister so gutless that he could not be upfront with the Australian people about his plans before they voted for him?

                                            The Prime Minister has broken his promise to reduce power bills by $275 a year. He's broken his promise on methane emissions from cattle, and now he is breaking his promise to fund infrastructure. Why has the Prime Minister not had the courage to be upfront with the Australian people about his plans before they voted for him?

                                             The Prime Minister is a man of courage and a man of authenticity. Those opposite might not like that fact, but that's what he is. No amount of coming in here and asking such—really, Senator Canavan, if you want to give a speech, why don't you just give a speech? That's not even a question here in question time, is it? It's just a little bit of diatribe, trying to get a little bit of invective up in the chamber. It's not actually seeking any information, which is what question time should be.

                                             I've made it clear that there are 700 regional budget commitments tonight that relate to the regions, which includes $9.6 billion of election commitments for infrastructure. The project to which Senator Canavan refers remains in the budget.
