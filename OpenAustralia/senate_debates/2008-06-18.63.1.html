        The explanatory statements that accompany these instruments make no reference to consultation in accordance with section 4 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. Further, the explanatory statement for the Trial Protocols instrument contains a footnote which explains the accepted meaning of the phrase “application for chemical products”. It would assist in achieving clarity and certainty if the interpretation section of the principal Instrument (section 4) were amended to include this definition.

        This instrument makes various amendments to certain visas and visa subclasses in the principal Regulations. The amendments made by Schedule 1 to this instrument commence retrospectively. They reintroduce the power of the Minister to grant refunds of certain visa application charges. The amendments are intended to correct an error introduced by a previous set of amendments, and are of beneficial effect. The explanatory statement provides no advice about the mechanisms by which applicants who became entitled to a refund during the period of retrospective operation will be made aware of their right to request a refund.
