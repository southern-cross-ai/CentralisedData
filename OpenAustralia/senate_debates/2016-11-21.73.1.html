        My question is for the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham. Could the minister update the Senate on how our international education sector is growing, in terms of both numbers and employment outcomes for Australians?

         I thank Senator McKenzie for yet another thoughtful question in the education and training portfolio. Our international education sector is absolutely booming, and booming to good effect for all Australians. We have seen some 11 per cent growth in international education participation numbers in Australia since 2013. Since the coalition came to power there has been 11 per cent growth in student numbers, which is ensuring that we have greater economic activity across a whole range of parts of the economy supported by those international students. So far in 2016 we have had a record half a million international students studying in Australia. That shows the scale of this sector now—half a million different international students passing through Australia already in 2016, shared across all states, shared across all major cities and shared across our rural and regional areas as well. ABS data shows that international education contributed $20.3 billion to Australia's economy in 2015-16, making it our third largest exporter after coal and iron ore.
        </p>
        <p>
         We see from that new data the absolute scale supporting an estimated 130,700 full-time-equivalent jobs—jobs across the construction sector as accommodation is built, jobs across accommodation maintenance, jobs and opportunities for Australians across hospitality, and, of course, jobs and opportunities for Australians in education services themselves. These are enormous opportunities that are not only creating employment opportunities for Australians today but also enhancing our cooperation with other countries of the region through the collaborative education approaches that are undertaken between those international students and the Australian students they are studying alongside.

            Already around five per cent of international students currently study in Australia's regional areas, making a significant and hopefully growing contribution to those local regional economies. Around 54 per cent of international students studying in regional campuses are enrolled in higher education courses, and we see a higher propensity amongst those students in regional areas to be in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
             STEM
            </a>
            fields—some 37 per cent, compared with 26 per cent in metro areas. These courses include agriculture and livestock breeding at the University of New England in Armidale or marine biodiversity at
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook_University" rel="nofollow">
             James Cook University
            </a>
            in Cairns. Estimates for Armidale are that around $33 million is contributed to the local economy and 243 full-time equivalent jobs. But of course, as Senator McKenzie would be interested in, even those students studying in cities like Melbourne make a vast contribution to areas of regional Victoria: around $888 million of contribution supporting 5½ thousand full-time jobs.

               It is estimated that by 2025 there will be one billion potential international students in the world. Of course, we want to make sure that the 11 per cent growth that we have realised for Australia's international education sector since 2013 builds upon that and ensures that there are more opportunities for Australians to support this high-income, high-opportunity earner for our country, which creates jobs across a range of industries and supports the internationalisation and understanding of all of our domestic students as well. That is why our National Strategy for International Education is an important initiative. It is Australia's first ever national strategy, which is being brought together, implemented and delivered now by our Council for International Education, representatives of the different portfolios of government and the different sectors of the international education industry. It is building upon ensuring that we have student visa integrity, quality in our education design and incentives for innovation and market development around the world.
