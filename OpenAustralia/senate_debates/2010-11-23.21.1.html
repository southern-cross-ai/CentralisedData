         I thank Senator Payne for that very thoughtful question. This has been one of the more complex issues—and there are many—around the

For six to 12 months now we have been in detailed discussions with Telstra, the property sector and home owners to ensure that we get the balance right. We want to ensure that we are able to get the absolute best possible answer on this issue.

              Well, unfortunately I am getting the odd interjection, particularly from you, Senator Macdonald. The government is committed to ensuring that new developments have ready access to communications, and it considers high-speed fibre-optic infrastructure to be the best long-term solution. In fact, those opposite agreed with that during the election campaign. Let us be clear: from recollection, at that stunning press conference by

Can the minister please advise when the costs to homebuyers will be named, and should homebuyers in residential estates be given a choice of the type of internet technology they would prefer to use rather than being forced to pay the on-cost of installing fibre based broadband that they might not want to use?

                I thank Senator Payne for the question. Now, and increasingly into the future, high-speed broadband should be seen as a critical utility service like water, sewerage, electricity and gas. Belatedly, even the coalition has accepted this; it was your election policy. Those opposite had an election policy that recognised that fibre should be in new estates, but they provided no pathway towards this outcome and merely recommended that everything be put on hold.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister please advise the chamber when the cost will be known? What assurance can the government offer the Australian public that the installation of the

This followed, as I have already stated, extensive consultation and consideration of the implementation study recommendations. The government, as I said, is finalising the implementation details with NBN Co. and other stakeholders and will provide these shortly. In all instances, the government will ensure there are arrangements in place to ensure that people in new developments have access to telecommunications services if and when they are required. For the time being, developers and others should continue using the established process that Telstra has had in place—
