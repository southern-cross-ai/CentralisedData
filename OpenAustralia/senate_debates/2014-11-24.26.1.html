        Statement of reasons: why certain amendments should be moved as requests
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Section 53 of the Constitution is as follows:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Powers of the Houses in respect of legislation
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        53. Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendment (14)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The effect of this amendment is to expand the purposes for which payments may be made out of the standing appropriation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        in clause 99 of the Bill. It is covered by section 53 because expanding the purposes for which payments may be made out of the standing appropriation may increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under that standing appropriation.

       <p class="italic">
        Consequential amendments

       <p class="italic">
        Amendment (14)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The stated effect of paragraph 99(c) contained in this amendment is to provide for payments to be made, for actions or activities specified in new clause 98A, from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The increased expenditure would be met directly from the standing appropriation contained in clause 99 of the bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate has long followed the practice that it should treat as requests amendments which would clearly, necessarily and directly result in increased expenditure under a standing appropriation. If, as stated, this amendment would result in increased expenditure under the standing appropriation in clause 99 of the bill, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that this amendment be moved as a request.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendments (12) and (13)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendments (12) and (13) are consequential on the request. It is the practice of the Senate that amendments purely consequential on amendments framed as requests may also be framed as requests.

         These amendments are consequential on the requests. It is the practice of the Senate that amendments purely consequential on amendments framed as requests may also be framed as requests.
        </p>
        <p>
         These amendments relate to the issue of preserving the right to legal redress, as we have discussed in the contributions we made earlier and also as responded to by the minister in his closing of the original debate. They relate particularly to the issue of whether in this case it is better for people to have the option to retain their right to go through the legal process at the same time as maintaining the process to receive immediate payment.
        </p>
        <p>
         I take the minister's point in terms of what would be less intrusive or less difficult, but I draw the attention of the minister to the discussions that we had at the Community Affairs Committee, one being the importance of having appropriate legal support and reassurances from the department that there would be that ability. I continue to have the doubts that I raised at the committee in terms of ensuring that every single person would be able to get the detailed legal and financial support that is available in this legislation on the basis of just having that availability in the community to have practitioners who can do that. I am concerned about forcing the issue of people with disabilities, in some cases quite significant intellectual disabilities, having to make such a significant opt-in or opt-out decision on something that is so important to them. That came up consistently in the discussions that we had in the committee about ensuring that people knew what their rights were and ensuring that there were able to make the clear decision that was best for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         The proposal of the opposition has put forward for consideration is a model that works already in other parts of government process, where the protection is there that people are not having to make an original decision which automatically concludes their options. They are allowed to continue to get some form of payment and then, should there be a different decision, the overpayment that is then created is then created formally as an overpayment and a repayment schedule created for that person. That operates already in a number of areasâ€”in particular, compensation process and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Social Services
         </a>
         processes.
        </p>
        <p>
         I take the minister's concerns about whichever way you actually are working with people you want to ensure that they have the least stress in this process. We believe that this option maintains opportunities, maintains the choice that they are able to take up their legal options if they choose to and then be able to see which way they would be best protected or their futures secured. We strongly believe that this in fact is an appropriate option to offer for people; we believe there are protections of the system to allow it to occur; and we also believe that, should the legal and financial adviceâ€”which is already in this bill saying that people have to have thatâ€”that same legal and financial advice would be able to adequately talk about the impact of any overpayment. That should already be covered in the processes that are there.
        </p>
        <p>
         We commend the amendments before you and we actually believe that it supports the process rather than in any way making it more complex.

          outlined our strong concerns with this whole bill during the second reading debate. These changes, while they go to address some of our concerns, do not address all our concerns. We still have deep concerns that this bill does not adequately address the issues that face people with disability who were paid under the BSWAT scheme. While we can agree with them in principle, they do not fix the bill and by agreeing to these in principle, we still do not support the bill.
