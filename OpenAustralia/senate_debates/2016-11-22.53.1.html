        My question is directed to the Attorney-General, who is representing the Minister for Defence today. Retired Lieutenant Colonel Dubsky is in the public gallery today. He was used as a scapegoat by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        in the so-called '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Jedi Council
        </a>
        ' scandal. Lieutenant Colonel Dubsky and his family's lives were destroyed when he was falsely accused of being a member of the Jedi Council. Lieutenant Colonel Dubsky had his name illegally leaked by the Army to the media. Because of unfair attacks on his reputation by his superiors, Lieutenant Colonel Dubsky suffered a complete mental health breakdown. He has survived two suicide attempts and endured many years of psychiatric ward admissions and electroconvulsive shock therapy. His wife and children have also been grievously harmed and forced to suffer significant physical, mental and financial injury. Will the Turnbull government compensate the Dubsky family through a special mediation process or will they be forced into a lengthy legal battle in the courts?

         Thank you very much, Senator Lambie. I know that you have taken a close interest in this issue, and I want to welcome Mr Dubsky and his family to the Senate today. You will understand, Senator Lambie, that it is not appropriate to comment on individual cases, and I am not proposing to do that. But I can give you some information about the mental health care and rehabilitation services that the ADF provides to ADF personnel and ex-servicemen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 2009, Defence has invested approximately $201 million in providing a range of education and awareness, treatment and rehabilitation programs for all Defence members irrespective of the cause of their mental health problems. Defence works closely with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Veterans' Affairs
         </a>
         on programs and initiatives to strengthen mental health resilience, increase awareness, improve access to care and encourage members and families to seek help early. Defence members and their families are also able to access the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service throughout Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         A 2016 budget measure extended non-liability health care to all current and former ADF members for post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder or substance abuse disorder. Under this arrangement, treatment can be provided through the Department of Veterans' Affairs, for those conditions, without having to establish a link to military service. The measure is being implemented by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and is currently being passed through the parliament. Injured or wounded Defence members are encouraged and supported to submit claims for compensation to the Department of Veterans' Affairs through their on-base advisory services.

                      No, Senator Lambie, that is not a point of order; that is a debating point. There are other avenues within the Senate for you to debate that. Attorney-General, you have the call.
