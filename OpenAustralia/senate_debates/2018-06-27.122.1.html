        Purpose of the bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill gives effect to the Asia Region Funds Passport (ARFP) in Australia, a multilateral framework that facilitates cross border offering of managed investment funds in participating economies. The participating economies are Australia, Japan, Korea,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , and Thailand. Singapore, the Philippines and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
         Hong Kong
        </a>
        have been observers in the regular ARFP

        </a>
        meetings of participating economies and maintain interest in the scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ARFP will allow Australian funds to sell their products into other participating economies, including Asia's expanding middle class and growing numbers of high net worth individuals, and achieve greater economies of scale. Other participating economies will also be able to sell their products into Australia, meaning increased competition and choice for Australian investors.

         The Memorandum
        </a>
        of Cooperation committed participating economies to endeavour to implement the Passport by 31 December 2017. Japan and Thailand are now very close to being ready to go live on their arrangements so it is imperative that Australia is also ready. The readiness of any two economies can trigger the start of the Passport.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A piloting process is currently underway to test arrangements, which is expected to run until July 2018. The formal commencement of the Passport is expected to occur in around August or September 2018, once the Joint Committee has considered the results of the pilot. The next Joint Committee meeting is expected to take place by telephone in July 2018.

        Introduction and passage in the 2018 Winter session of parliament is required for commencement on 1 August 2018.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is significant public concern about the cumulative period of farm household allowance (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FHA" rel="nofollow">
         FHA
        </a>
        ) being limited to three years. In particular, recent feedback from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and Queensland is that some farmers and their partners who have exhausted their three years of payment have not had an opportunity to implement their plans for financial self-sufficiency and remain in financial hardship, mainly due to ongoing poor climatic conditions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Extending FHA by one additional year will give current and former recipients access to another year of FHA payments, as well as provide breathing space to be able to implement their plans to improve their circumstances.
