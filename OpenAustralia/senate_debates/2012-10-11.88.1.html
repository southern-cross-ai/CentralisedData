           I thank Senator Crossin for her continued interest in public policy in agriculture, unlike those opposite. The Gillard government is a strong supporter of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Australia
           </a>
           . I have met with and support local industry about the issues that matter to them. One example is the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAC" rel="nofollow">
            AAC
           </a>
           o pastoral proposal for an abattoir in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           . The government has held discussions with AACo and the Northern Territory government about this proposal and through the Northern Australian Ministerial Forum and in consultation with the industry, the Gillard government is supporting the northern jurisdiction in developing a comprehensive beef strategy for Northern Australia. This strategy has included examining the feasibility of an abattoir facility in Northern Australia. The Northern Australian beef strategy is an element of Northern Australian Sustainable Futures program, a Labor election commitment.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government has also provided information to AACo on programs it could apply to for funding. The government has an open-door policy in dealing with industry. But I was surprised to read this morning that having an open door to the north is a rare thing for those opposite. In
           <i>
            Queensland Country Life
           </i>
           today, I read that when AACo went to speak to the Liberals about the project, they referred them off to the Nationals. The door from the Liberals was shut in their face. That is the Liberal approach to dealing with industry: shut in their face. AACo goes on to talk about the dangers of this approach. I quote: 'If the coalition is going to rely on the Nationals to develop Australian agricultural policy, they must demonstrate they are mature enough to lead the debate and policy development.' But at the moment the coalition has a real problem, because you can comfortably say that the Nationals are not demonstrating those qualities at all. AACo said, '

             . It is to have a coherent and consistent agricultural policy that supports our producers and processors and encourages trade and regional jobs—but we are not seeing that from those opposite. For months now, I have been saying: the Nationals are the doormats to the Liberals. But maybe I have been wrong. I have discovered that the monkeys have been running the zoo all along! Time and time again lately, we are seeing that Senator Joyce is calling the shots. On wheat they are shamelessly divided and undermining their leader. You are undermining your leader!
