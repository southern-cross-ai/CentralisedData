        My question is directed to Senator Birmingham, who I understand represents finance matters for the government at the moment. Minister, can you please clarify whether

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison

         I thank Senator Georgiou for his question. Earlier I went through a number of the achievements of the Turnbull government. A very significant one that I failed to mention was the achievement of the government in terms of fixing inequities in relation to

             reform is a key reform of the Turnbull government and of this coalition government, and I am confident it will be an enduring reform. In fact, I would be so bold as to predict that, at some time—which I hope is a very long, long way away—those opposite, who have not given a straight answer in relation to our GST reform, will actually just quietly accept it. At some time in the future they will quietly accept it, for Mr Shorten was shown to be somebody incapable, as a leader, of making difficult decisions, of delivering the tough reform that our GST reform has indeed put in place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our proposal is a real measure of reform. It will benchmark all states to the economies of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             or Victoria. It will provide greater stability and predictability in state GST payments. We are boosting the GST pool available for the states by providing an injection of $600 million in the pool in 2020-21 and a further $250 million in 2024-25, with all of it to be indexed. I am confident that the only threat to the GST arrangements are those opposite, because they have no policy in this space. They promise bandaid solutions. My WA Senate colleagues—each and every one of them—and the coalition's, the Liberal Party's

             n lower house members, championed long and hard for real GST reform, not Labor's bandaid solution and, as a coalition government, we are proud to have achieved it.

                reform by this coalition government is here to stay—under this coalition government, under any future coalition governments—and the only threat that exists is under a future Labor government. It is the Labor Party who squibbed it when it came to GST reform. Mr Shorten thought a little bucket of money for some infrastructure projects would be enough to buy off

                 Western Australia
                </a>
                , whereas instead Mr Turnbull, Mr Morrison, Senator Cormann and every single WA Liberal senator and House of Representatives member worked hard, worked together to ensure that we came up with a fair solution, an enduring solution, that will ensure that Western Australia gets its fair share of the GST whilst ensuring that every other state continues to enjoy funding growth from the GST pool to be able to invest into their essential services as well.
