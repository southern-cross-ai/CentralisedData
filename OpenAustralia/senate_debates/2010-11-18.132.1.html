       <p>
        The annual report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        provides a very concerning picture about the activities and capacity of the Australian War Memorial to reflect appropriately on Australia’s experience in war. The report reveals that there are pending staffing cuts of more than 20 staff at the Australian War Memorial in the next year or so, on top of 17 staff already cut recently from the memorial. This comes on top of decisions to axe highly successful open days and a much beloved annual event where Christmas carols were conducted at the Australian War Memorial. It has also been revealed that the council of the Australian War Memorial considered cutting one day a week out of the memorial’s program in order to save money. This is one of Australia’s premier national institutions. It is more than simply a tourist attraction, important though it is in that regard in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        ; it is also an important national memorial and a place where Australians can appropriately reflect on this nation’s experience of war. The idea that its programs and its capacity to deliver that important reflection on Australia’s role to the Australian nation should be reduced is absolutely disgraceful.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this government came to office in 2007, some $7 million has been ripped from the budget of the Australian War Memorial. That is an absolute disgrace. This is an institution of great importance to this community and to the Australian community. To see it denuded of its capacity to do the important things that it does, particularly as we approach the centenaries of a number of major milestones of the first part of the 20th century, is very concerning indeed. Of course, 2014 will mark the centenary of the beginning of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        and 2015 will mark the centenary of the landing at Gallipoli. I wonder how well this great national institution, the Australian War Memorial, will be able to properly mark that occasion, bring its importance to the attention of all Australians and conduct appropriate commemorations of these centenaries, when its funding has been so dramatically cut by this Labor government. Frankly, I do not believe it will be possible to properly mark those occasions in the present circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        I condemn this government for its decisions with respect to the Australian War Memorial. I expect it to reconsider; I expect it to acknowledge that the memorial cannot do its important job with these sorts of serious cuts going on. I note that the government has pledged to include national institutions in the efficiency dividend that is applied—a dividend it attacked when it was in opposition but has applied in government; indeed, it has increased it at various points in government. I implore it to reconsider this policy. This institution, and indeed others in the national capital, play a role which is far too important to be compromised by the penny-pinching of this government.

         I also rise to take note of the annual report. I start off by thanking Senator Humphries for the way he has taken up the cudgel in relation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         . He has passionately advocated the case for the War Memorial since these appalling funding cuts came to our attention. Full strength to Senator Humphries in his pursuit on behalf of not just the people of Canberra but also the people of Australia to make sure this magnificent memorial remains adequately funded.
        </p>
        <p>
         I indicate to the chamber that the mission of the Australian War Memorial is:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … to assist Australians to remember, interpret and understand the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on Australian society.
        </p>
        <p>
         How can we achieve that without adequate funding? How can the Australian War Memorial meet its mission statement without appropriate and adequate funding? In this year’s report the most telling commentary from anyone was from General Peter Cosgrove, who is chairman of the memorial’s council. In the report he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This year has seen a further reduction in the operational budget for the Memorial …
        </p>
        <p>
         He went on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The challenge for the Memorial is to do more with less but there are limits to how far this approach can be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Humphries has mentioned the staff reductions. Senator Humphries has mentioned the fact that the War Memorial actually considered closing for a day a week. The government says they did not end up doing that, but that is not the point; the point is that they were forced to consider it. No-one knows more than Senator Humphries about the enormous contribution of the staff and volunteers at the Australian War Memorial; I have heard him praise them in our discussions about this matter. But they are being let down by the government.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do not care what the government says about this; the simple fact is that the operational budget of the Australian War Memorial has been slashed by this government. It does not matter how you try and cloak this argument in smoke and mirrors, the operational budget has been reduced. When we left government, it was $37 million; it is now $31 million. It is a substantial reduction in funding. I am a bit sick and tired of hearing people say, ‘Well, we might do something about addressing it.’ Stop talking about it, and do something about it, because the operational budget has been cut. Senator Humphries said that that has resulted in staff cuts. This memorial is under enormous pressure. The Gillard Labor government needs to do something about it very quickly.

          I also rise to speak on this document. I endorse wholeheartedly the comments of Senator Humphries and Senator Ronaldson. There are some things in life that are sacrosanct. One of them is the reverence and the esteem in which we hold those who have fallen in the greatest sacrifice of all for their nation.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was horrified last year when I found out one of the considerations for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
           Australian War Memorial
          </a>
          was that the last post, which is played every day—it is one of the most poignant and symbolic things that happen at the War Memorial—was going to be either axed or else corporate sponsorship was going to be sought to fund the playing of it. That was horrific. It was so horrific that I discussed it with war veterans in my home state of Tasmania, and we took up a petition—and that petition has been lodged in this parliament—condemning the proposal to seek sponsorship for the playing of the last post at Australia’s premier war memorial. I could not believe that, and I know thousands of other Australians shared my view.
         </p>
         <p>
          To cut funding to an institution such as this is basically saying: we do not care about the memories, we do not care about honouring and we do not care about respect for those who have gone before us, those who have laid down their lives in support of our great nation and other nations around the world.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is also a great symbol of democracy. When you honour your dead you are honouring your democracy and democratic rights around the world. I think governments need to make sure that funding is not cut to things like this. It is one of the most revered places in this country. People flock to the War Memorial. When people come to Canberra, they always include the War Memorial on their itinerary. It is one of the premier things they include on their itinerary.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am very concerned and I condemn the government for even considering reducing the budget for the Australian War Memorial. It is something that should not be played with. It is not something they should take lightly. We need to honour the dead of this country, especially those who have fallen in defence of this nation.

          I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
