         Before I go into the substance of the amendments just moved by Minister
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrell" rel="nofollow">
          Farrell
         </a>
         , I'd just like to put a couple of comments on the record and then seek some further clarification around the general nature of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
          Social Security
         </a>
         (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022 before we moved to vote on these particular amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Currently, income management in Australia is delivered by two particular means. It is either delivered through the BasicsCard, which sits under a piece of legislation called income management legislation, or delivered through the cashless debit card legislation by technology that is commonly referred to as the cashless debit card. Senator Farrell, I'm very keen to understand whether it is your intention to cause ongoing uncertainty for communities that are currently operating the cashless debit card technology as income management because of your intention, which you have indicated today, to bring your so-called enhanced technology solution into this place for consideration prior to 6 March 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also note that when you gave your final second reading speech you referred in your contribution to consultation. I would like to draw the attention of the chamber to the definition of 'consultation' and what it actually is. Consultation occurs when you actually go out and seek the views of somebody around a particular issue prior to making a determination or a decision in relation to that particular issue. The definition of 'consultation' is not 'going and telling people what you're doing after you've made a decision and after you've announced a decision'. That is actually just going out and telling them what you're intending to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Farrell, when you came in here, you referred to consultation, as did many of your colleagues before you in their contributions. You did not consult on this bill with anybody before you made the decision in the lead-up to the election that you were intending to bring it into this place. So I put that on the record. But what I'd like to understand from you on the particular amendment that you have before us is this: is it the intention of this government to pursue any form of compulsory or mandatory income management in Australia from this time?

          In response to the questions from the shadow minister I think I'd start at the beginning, and that starts with the election result, where Labor took a position to the Australian people where we said, because of all the problems with the cashless debit card, that we were going to move to abolish that card. So, that was the position that we took to the Australian people. We didn't do that lightly. We did it after much thought. But, more particularly, we did it after much consultation. People like Senator

            alone. They didn't stop talking to the people of the Northern Territory in this particular case. And what did the people of the Northern Territory do? They re-elected two Labor members as well as

            But let me talk to you a bit about what we did. Prior to the election Labor heard the many calls from people living on the card who said that the card was negatively affecting their lives and their ability to manage their money. The Minister for

           <p>
            I'm happy to go through the dates of those visits. In Ceduna it was 23 and 24 June 2022; that was Minister Rishworth. East Kimberley was 29 June to 1 July; that was Minister Rishworth again. Bundaberg and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">
             Hervey Bay
            </a>
            was 4 and 5 July; that was Assistant Minister Elliot.

             Cape York

            was 9 and 10 August; that was Assistant Minister Elliot. Cairns was 12 August; that was Minister Rishworth. Then the Goldfields was 15 and 16 August; that was Minister Elliot. Finally, the Northern Territory was 17 to 19 August; again, that was Minister Rishworth. So I'd submit that that's pretty conclusive evidence of the consultation that this government participated in before we moved this legislation.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to the other particular question that the shadow minister asked, we simply can't sit back and wait for 2023 to roll around, meanwhile extending a payment management system that amounts to privatised welfare. This is not in the best interests of the recipients and, more importantly, not in the best interests of taxpayers. That's why we are passing legislation through the parliament right now to abolish the card.

              for her question. As we transition people away from mandatory measures, we'll continue to offer assistance, and we'll take the time necessary to research, develop, consult and implement a future social security payment system that will target supports to the people who identify that their family would benefit from it. The government is making the path to life beyond the

              our focus today, and we will focus on the future. As we work through this, we must also work with communities to identify what other key supports are needed, not only to support individuals as they transition off the card but to put in place other programs and supports to help the community address issues of alcohol and other drug misuse, domestic violence and problem gambling.

                (Administration) Act 1999 does not sunset, it operates through a number of legislative instruments that sunset every 10 years. These instruments enable income management to operate in specific locations, and/or income management measures. Six of these legislative instruments were due to sunset on 1 October 2022. In order to consult effectively, the Attorney-General has agreed to a deferral of these six instruments for a period of 12 months. We are extending the instruments to allow time for consultation with communities, including

                peoples and leaders, on the future of income management. This will include what a voluntary model of income management looks like at a community or individual level and the best way to transition people who have been living on compulsory income management for 15 years. The transitional arrangements for the abolition of the

                will also consider pathways for participants to voluntarily income manage. This is why it is practical and appropriate for the existing instruments to remain in place until further decisions are made on the future of income management.

                 Minister, you made the comment that it was appropriate to keep in place these instruments until the future of income management in Australia had been decided when referring to the extension of compulsory income management in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

                 and a number of other sites around Australia. I, then, ask you: is it your intention to continue with compulsory income management in the four trial sites?

                  <p>
                   Yesterday there were questions in question time in relation to the extension of compulsory income management in the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                    Northern Territory
                   </a>
                   and other sites. Whilst failing to answer the questions during question time, you did come to the chamber after question time and put on the record that it is the intention of the Albanese Labor government to extend compulsory income management in the Northern Territory and other income management sites around Australia. Today the Minister for
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
                    Indigenous Australians
                   </a>
                   said in the House, 'Mandatory income management has been a failure across the board, and we do not believe in mandatory income management.' Can you please clarify to me your position on extending compulsory income management in the Northern Territory and other sites with the position of the Minister for Indigenous Australians, who has today publicly said, 'We do not believe in mandatory income management.' You have extended that today in selected sites across Australia, whilst this piece of legislation seeks to move away from compulsory management in other places. Perhaps the minister might be able to explain to us why the government has made the decision to keep compulsory income management in place in the Northern Territory particularly, but has taken it out of other sites.

                   income management predominantly affects Indigenous Australians. In other sites around Australia with the

                   there's not necessarily as high a number of Indigenous Australians. Why has the government chosen to keep compulsory or mandatory income management in place for a majority Indigenous population?

                    and to ensure the continuation of support services for people. The minister and Assistant Minister Elliot visited Cape York communities to consult on what income management should look like and what supports will be required to ensure communities are best placed to address the complex social issues that they face.

                    The model of income management operated in the Cape York region by the Family Responsibilities Commission is distinct to the broad-base compulsory income management models elsewhere in the country. The FRC model is one informed by self-determination, which is something that the Albanese government is committed to supporting for our
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

                    communities. We will always listen closely to these communities about the solutions they would like to see in their communities.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The Minister for Social Services visited the Cape York region in recent weeks and spoke with Commissioner Tammy Williams and the local commissioner for Doomadgee. She also met with

                    and gave evidence to the Senate committee hearing into the

                    </a>
                    that he does not agree with the blanket imposition of the card. Assistant Minister Elliot also visited the remote Cape York community of Aurukun to observe the FRC's operation at work.

                    As far as the

                     Northern Territory
                    </a>
                    is concerned, there's no evidence that this card has made any difference. The card has not worked. It does not address the concerns of some communities about alcohol abuse and violence in the community, particularly against women and children. We need new ways to do better for Northern Territory Australians. Forget about the discriminatory practices introduced by those opposite. People on compulsory income management in the Northern Territory will go back to the BasicsCard for the time being. We are continuing our discussions with the people in these communities so that we can consider their needs in any future decisions.

                             and that people in the Northern Territory on the CDC would transition back to the BasicsCard. I am just wondering whether you could clarify whether that is correct or you have misspoken.

                              I propose to answer in the way I started answering, and that is that the government is working to engage a third-party provider to provide a modern card for people leaving the

                              and moving back to income management. Under the new arrangements, Services Australia would do all customer functions such as taking calls, providing replacement cards and handling account balance requests. The third-party provider would only provide the back-office functions of the card such as maintaining an account so that payments are made through Visa and merchant processing transactions and such as reporting to Services Australia. Specific negotiations with a third-party provider are commercial-in-confidence, and I cannot comment on those.

                                           I want to start by putting our perspective on the record so that my questions will be considered in that context. The Greens' position is that we are against any form of compulsory income management because it has clearly failed to work. We have had—what is it?—six years of so-called trials of the cashless debit card, which have failed to address the social problems which they were set up to address. We have had evaluations that have shown very clearly that there has not been any evidence that the cashless debit card has addressed those social problems. We have had a scathing report from the Auditor-General that has shown that compulsory income management has failed. It is a harmful, punitive approach, and it's basically trying to mask an awful lot of other social problems, which are the issues that need to be addressed. We've heard in many speeches, yesterday and today, people being very concerned—and quite rightly—about social problems in some communities across Australia but then jumping to the conclusion that compulsory income management is going to fix those problems. Clearly the evidence from the BasicsCard, which was introduced in the
                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

                                           after the Intervention, and from the cashless debit card over the last six years, has shown that compulsory income management has not fixed those problems. Otherwise, the communities it has been imposed upon would have had very clear evidence of having an improvement in those social issues, and it just hasn't happened.

                                          <p>
                                           Given that context, the Greens are supporting this bill because it is going to mean fewer people under compulsory income management, because the people in the four trial sites are, after the royal assent to this bill, going to have the ability to get off compulsory income management. That is a huge step forward. I am going to be celebrating with those people in those four trial sites. I know that there are many of them who are just waiting to get off the cashless debit card. We've got amendments that will be attempting to get more people off compulsory income management. But, as I said, we're going to be supporting this bill because it is going to mean fewer people under compulsory income management.

                                           I want to just ask the minister some questions of clarification, starting off with this. Will anyone who is currently not on compulsory income management be forced to go onto compulsory income management as a result of this bill?

The affected participants are subject to the income management legislation in the Northern Territory and would have been placed back onto the BasicsCard without this amendment offering them enhanced technology.

                                             Thank you, Minister. Just clarifying, just putting on the record, that the rationale for us supporting this bill is that, well, it's a step forward. It's moving some people off compulsory income management and not putting any new people on.

                                             Minister, the media release that was put out by Minister Rishworth refers to 17,300 people transitioning off the cashless debit card and onto the new arrangements or off the program completely. Can you take us through how many people are transitioning off completely?

Therefore, I can't provide an exact answer, but the government does expect that the majority of participants in Bundaberg,

There are 3,865 out-of-area people, of which just under half are First Nations participants. That comes to a total of 16,886, as I mentioned earlier, with First Nations participants representing just over 50 per cent.

In terms of not knowing how many people are going to be transitioning off completely because you don't know how many people will choose to voluntarily stay on the card, have you got any indication of numbers? Based on the consultation that has been done in the lead-up to the abolition, what proportion of people might choose to stay on the card voluntarily?

                                                    Part of this whole process is giving back to individual Australians their right to make decisions, which the previous government took away from them in a particularly unfair and cruel manner. The work that's been done by Minister Rishworth is giving these people back the right to make their own decisions about what they do in their lives and how they spend their money. We could only guess what the final numbers are going to be, and if I could give you a more accurate answer than that I certainly would. The whole purpose of this is giving back to those people some rights to make decisions about their futures, particularly to

                                                     You're giving them their rights back. So Labor is okay with our children giving all their money to a bikie to buy ice? We're okay with that, are we? I just want to know. You're okay about giving them back, but you won't answer these hard questions. I want to know what you're going to do with these people once you give them all their money back and they go and spend it all down at the bottle shop and run around drunk, abusing their communities, or they buy ice and get violent in their communities. Labor's okay with that, is it? We don't need to manage them at all! We don't need to provide services ready to go! You want to take 12 months to work that out. Tell me what that's going to look like in the next 12 months, because you're so okay with bringing harm to the rest of the community. Explain that to the rest of Australia, because I'm not getting it.

I simply say to you that I totally reject the implication in your question. But, to try and provide you with more information about what the government is intending to do, we are committed to ensuring that people are able to come off the card as quickly as possible, and support will be available to those who need it, including for those opting for voluntary income management. We are setting up a Centrepay arrangement and referrals for local supports. It is critical that those who do need some extra help with the changes to their financial arrangements are able to get it. This may include an option for individuals to transition to voluntary income management programs.

I was wondering if you could supply me with the evidence of where you got that from. Today is good.

What evidence did Labor use during the 2022 election to go out there and tell age pensioners that the coalition intended to put them on the cashless debit card? I want to know where you got the evidence. I want to know where Labor got the evidence to say that the coalition was going to do that, because you spent a lot of time scaring age pensioners about that and that's really unfair. I think that's a real low point for Labor. I want you to supply me with the evidence on how you came up with that, that the coalition ever said they were going to put age pensioners on that card. Where is the evidence? That's what I'm asking you. Every age pensioner out there deserves of an answer. Who was lying? Show me the evidence that the coalition said this on paper or said it elsewhere. Show me where you got that evidence from? You are not getting away with this, not tonight.

Not for people to volunteer, but for the Commonwealth government to place people on income management—was that your intention? You voted against that amendment, so was that the intention? Do you believe that the Commonwealth government should have the right to place aged pensioners, veteran pensioners or service pensioners on income management?

Look, we voted against your amendment because we are the government, we have put forward a bill, we have amended that bill and it reflects what we took to the Australian people at the last election. I know you are the former minister in this area, Senator Ruston, and I know you've got an attachment to the Cashless Debit Card. I know there's a reluctance on the part of the opposition—because I see it every day in question time—to accept the result of the Australian people but, like it or not, the Australian people elected an

The Prime Minister appointed Minister Rishworth to this portfolio, and I have to say she has been doing a terrific job both in preparing this legislation and in consulting with the Australian people about the introduction of it. I know you're having trouble coming to terms with that change, and I know you think that amendments that you introduce should be supported by the government but, unfortunately, Senator Ruston, the Australian people didn't elect you as a government. They elected the Anthony Albanese government, and we're presenting our bills and our amendments to the Australian people. We're presenting it to the Senate, and we are asking the Senate to make a decision about what we have proposed.

During consultation, they made the point that transition needed to reflect the complex needs of the participants and to mitigate any disruption to their ability to manage their money disbursements and their ability to buy essential goods and services. We'll continue consultation over the next 18 months to ensure communities are supported to decide what the future of income management looks like for them.

However, we do not recommend this approach due to the difficulties in accessing the large number of participants in the various locations, which are vastly spread out across Australia. Our proposed 18-month time frame will ensure that there is a sufficient amount of time to consult affected communities on the look of the program. It will also ensure the transition of participants in a supported and targeted approach, noting that many people have been part of this program for more than 10 years.

My question to you is one that highlights the need for truth in political advertising laws, and I really commend your commitment to electoral reform and look forward to working with you to ensure that this sort of thing doesn't happen in future. Labor did a great job of conflating all income management with the CDC, and my hunch is that there are a lot of Australians out there who think that your election commitment to repeal CDC simply means that all compulsory income management is going, which isn't the case. I look forward to seeing your plan to do that. I look forward to seeing your plan to work with communities. My question to Senator Farrell is: given Labor clearly made these comments before the election, why not just own up to it?

Part of my portfolio, of course, deals with electoral reform, and I look forward to working with you to make a range of reforms to the Australian electoral system. You mentioned one, but there will be many others. I look forward to having some cooperative discussions with you about what those reforms might look like and ultimately look forward to your support for those very sensible changes to our electoral laws.

Income management was created in 2007 as part of the Howard coalition government's Northern Territory emergency response, often referred to correctly as the Intervention. As part of that scheme, income management was initially introduced to prescribed areas of the Northern Territory, including 73 remote communities, associated outstations and 10 town camp regions. It formed part of the Howard government's response to the high levels of alcohol and substance abuse that were linked to child protection issues described in the

It's a tool that helps individuals budget their welfare payments to ensure that they are able to pay for the essentials, such as food, clothing, housing and electricity. It works by making a proportion of a person's welfare payment income managed and directing it towards these essentials.

He has confirmed that the comments that I made were about the superiority of the cashless debit card as a platform for the delivery of income management for those people who were on the BasicsCard in the Northern Territory and other sites around Australia. So I thank him very much for correcting the record. I really appreciate that, Senator Farrell, because for a very long time a number of your colleagues have been out there making a statement that, clearly, they knew was false and misleading. The fact that you have acknowledged that my comments referred to income management and that income management was the mechanism for the delivery of the BasicsCard in the Northern Territory and other sites around Australia is very much appreciated, Senator Farrell. You have now put on the public record the misleading scare campaign that was run by the opposition during the election campaign and prior to it.

During consultation they made the point that transition needed to reflect the complex needs of the participants and to mitigate any disruption to the ability to manage their money disbursements and the ability to buy essential goods and services. We will continue consultation over the next 18 months to ensure that the communities are supported to decide what the future of income management looks like for them.

However, we do not recommend this approach, due to the difficulties in assessing the large numbers of participants in various locations, which are vastly spread out across Australia. Our proposed 18-month time frame will ensure that there is a sufficient amount of time to consult affected communities on the look of the program. It will also ensure the transition of participants in a supported and targeted approach, noting that many people have been part of this program for more than 10 years.

How are you running this so we can all find out what's going on, on a monthly basis—and also publish the transition plan on the department's website once again? I think you said you were going to get back on that. But, more importantly, how are you reviewing the withdrawal and when are we going to get updates on the withdrawal? Is that going to be monthly? Quarterly? And who's doing it? Surely you've got someone ready to review it; you're pulling it.

They've been able to, I think, get to the very nub of the reason that we're here in this predicament. We're debating the abolition of the cashless debit card and the genesis of the fact that we're, right here, now talking about getting rid of a card that we know is helping communities, helping vulnerable people to make better choices with their money and to provide protection to the wider community, particularly the elderly and women in these communities. We hear, from so many of them, that talk about the impact.
                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                             What is the genesis? I think you've really hit the nail on the head with those questions about the lie that was spread in the lead-up to the campaign, that the coalition was going to put age pensioners and veterans onto the cashless debit card. That's why we're now in this position. If you're going to make a lie true, you've got to demonise the instrument that's being used to help communities. So you had to single out the cashless debit card, the instrument that's helping people. They were forced into a situation where, because you were demonising it—when journalists asked the question 'What are you going to do about it?' you said you would abolish it, without thinking about the impact it would have on the ground and in communities.
                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                             What we're now seeing, with these amendments, is that through the committee process—and credit to the government; they've listened through the committee process. They've recognised that the BasicsCard is a really old, redundant technology. It's a stored value card. It's not universal. You can't use it everywhere. There are fewer than 16,000 merchants who will let you use it, compared to the cashless debit card that has over 900,000 merchants or thereabouts who will let you use it. They've got themselves into this position because they had to make their lie true, and we know that you can't make a lie true by just telling more lies.

It will have 'tap and go' with the ability of the person to turn this off if they don't wish to use it. It will have internet banking, using the Visa system. It can be used in stores with access to

The account will be a bank account that allows the person to use the BPAY system to pay bills. A person will be able to set up direct debits from their account, and people will not be able to withdraw cash from the account. Services Australia will be responsible for customer-facing services, including opening the account, issuing the card, call centre functions, issuing temporary cards and providing statements and websites for participants. Participants will be able to get information on their account and transactions from Services Australia. This is similar to the services they provide under the income management program. The account provider will perform the back-of-office functions that support the card. These include providing bank account transaction processing, the system that approves transactions at the sales terminal, payment of accounts to Visa and EFTPOS, fraud monitoring and reporting to Services Australia.

I respectfully listen to all of the questions, and I respectfully try to answer them without interruption. I do not interfere or interrupt the questions that are being asked, and I would like the same respect when I answer the question. I try to answer the questions as honestly and straightforwardly as I'm able to, and I would like to continue doing that, with your permission.

In fact, I think we can generally behave in this place in a civil manner, respectfully deal with all the issues that you would like answered, and then, in due course, vote on the legislation and implement what the Australian people voted for at the last election, which is the end of this card.

The government has listened to communities; they want the functions of this type of banking product. However, the government's amendments establish a program with important differences to the existing CDC program.

The government firmly believes that participants should not have to deal with a private company, and our amendments return this role to government.

Will there be support provided to cardholders, because many of them already have direct debits in place with the cashless debit card?

All that's happening here is it's just getting relabelled. It is currently a silver-coloured card. Maybe there will be a new picture. You might be able to get your face on it, or you might be able to get it printed with some pretty colours or something. I don't know. But you've just revealed to us that it's the same thing.

Currently, if you're a BasicsCard holder, you can't purchase pornography or tobacco. With this new card—this enhanced card or contemporary card—will you be able to purchase pornography and tobacco?

Is that based on the assessment of the features that are available on the BasicsCard? You're calling it an enhanced card or a contemporary card; is that based on the BasicsCard or is that meaning an enhancement of the cashless debit card?

We did extensive consultation after the election. I outlined that in very considerable detail in one of my earlier answers. I still think you don't quite get this concept. We took the abolition of the cashless debit card to the Australian people. Why did we do that? Because people like Senator

Our candidates in other states, wherever the cashless debit card might apply, did the same thing. We talked to people around the country. What did they tell us? They said, 'We don't want the cashless debit card.' We took that to the Australian people. You might not like it but we took that to the Australian people, and what did they do at that election? They elected a Labor government. And what are we doing here tonight? Well, we're implementing the policy that we took to the last election. You might not like it, and you might not accept that the Australian people have made a decision about this, but they did. They did make a decision about it, and it's time for you to accept it.

Minister Rishworth has brought to this place—it's already passed the lower house, and tonight or tomorrow morning, sometime, it's going to pass the Senate—this legislation. And you've got to get over the fact that the Australian people rejected you at the last election. They elected a Labor government and what they want us to do is what we told them we were going to do, and that is abolish the cashless debit card.

We put a proposition to the Australian people. There was no equivocation about the proposition that we took to the Australian people. Shadow Minister Burney, as she was then, made it unequivocally clear: 'If you vote in a Labor government, then we will abolish this card.' Why did they do it? Because they spoke to people in the Territory and other parts of the country, and that was the message that came back to us: 'We want you to abolish the cashless debit card.' We spoke to the Australian people. We said, 'Will you support us on this?' The unequivocal answer was, 'Yes, we support you.'

There was also an opportunity—I think it was only with former senator Rex Patrick—to go to Nhulunbuy; we were able to go that far as well. On all those occasions, First Nations people raised their concerns. They obviously wanted to talk about the BasicsCard. They were trying to understand what this new cashless card was and what it would mean.

They also raised the need to have extra services that would give them support, whether it was around care for their children or extra school programs—certainly there were issues around extra housing. They were asking for other things that helped the social lifestyles of families in these communities, but it was very clear from those meetings I've mentioned that compulsory income management was something that they did not want.

It is an income management card, which you are now keeping in. We know it was brought out in 2007 by the Howard government, and Labor expanded it to a wider cohort of jobseekers, and not just Aboriginal people, in 2010. Please tell me why you did that in 2010, yet we still have the same social problems around and you don't want income management now, apart from the BasicsCard. Tell me why that is, because I don't understand it.

It came in in 2007 and was imposed on many thousands of people across the Territory. From memory, there was no review of that card until between 2010 and 2014. So the next decision was made in 2012. That was by, obviously, going to the election here. Federal Labor took it over from the coalition. I was not in the federal parliament at the time, but I remember, from a personal point of view, that we were lobbying our colleagues in Canberra to have a good look at the BasicsCard and wanting them to review it.

That's something that is very close to my heart.

That has always troubled me. So I would certainly like to say that, should this legislation pass through tonight, this parliament must look into the BasicsCard in the Northern Territory. Half those families may say: 'Don't touch it. We want to stay on it. We like it. It suits us. It works for us in our communities.' That's what they may say, but they've never really been asked because every focus has been on the cashless debit card.

I want to know why you're ripping the card off others and giving them a choice. You're going to put these people on a new beaut card if they want it; they're on income management too. Income management is the BasicsCard and the cashless debit card. It's income management. Actually, as a matter of fact, they're slightly different because one's 20-80 and the other's 50-50. I want to know what angle you're playing at here as a government.

So why would we make a decision to do something with the BasicsCard when no work whatsoever has been done by the previous government? So we have to do it carefully and cautiously and, yes, that will take time.

That's why, when this parliament does not follow its own due process—yet it does six inquiries into the cashless debit card—that is the only information we had to go on as to what was not working with this flawed card. These senators on the other side had the chance to fix that up, and you know it. You stood in this Senate and you called them out for it, so don't backtrack now.

What we have seen is that this bill is basically a shell of what they promised when they went to the last election. They went to the election and they promised that they were going to abolish the cashless debit card. This bill is called the

The cold hard fact is that this bill should read social security administration amendment (extension of the cashless debit card and other measures bill), because what we have heard from the minister tonight is that there is no effect whatsoever on compulsory income management as it is currently outlined under the income management legislation, and that all we are seeing is a so-called transition onto enhanced technology. We've heard, in answers given to other members in this place, that people will still have the cashless debit card. Even when they have supposedly been transitioned over onto this new technology they will still have a card with exactly the same number on it as is currently on their cashless debit card. As we all know, you can put as much lipstick on this pig as you like, the fact is that the cashless debit card is going to remain in place. This is one of the most embarrassing backflips I've ever seen.

Obviously the government has been forced into listening to a community like Cape York. We've seen an amendment that has enabled Cape York to be able to continue with the functionality that they have fought so long to be able to have, despite the fact that this government, without consultation, went to the election and said they were going to abolish the cashless debit card in Cape York. They clearly hadn't spoken to the members of the Cape York community, because of course they would've told them at the time that they didn't want the card to be abolished, which they've subsequently told them. They have backflipped on it. I am pleased that they have backflipped on that, because the community of Cape York clearly have worked very hard to try and deliver good outcomes for the members of their community.

They've tried to cloak this as some sort of amazing decision and delivery on an election promise. They have delivered very little by this legislation tonight.

We are happy that the government is making the decision to allow people who are on the cashless debit card in the Northern Territory to remain on the cashless debit card.

I will make you a fearless prediction in here that the government will come back with the cashless debit card technology. They will probably pop it in a different act. They'll probably give it a different name. But the cold hard reality is that what they will come back into this place with is the cashless debit card dressed up as something else.

You can be assured that every single person in this place will be watching what you're doing, because this has been nothing more than the most monumental con of the Australian public. You have not sought to abolish the cashless debit card. You have actually sought to extend it in some places. You have not sought to get rid of income management. You are intending to extend income management by the extension of instruments that put in place income management across the Northern Territory, and all of those sites that I have just listed here where you have said there will be no change to income management.

But at least you have given those people who voluntarily chose to go onto the cashless debit card the opportunity to remain on the cashless debit card. I look forward to seeing the legislation that you intend to bring back into this place to put what you are proposing for income management going forward.

You need to come clean with the Australian public about what your intentions are. I think it's been very clear from all the amendments you have put forward, and very clear from the $50 million that you reannounced on Saturday to go towards drug and alcohol services, that you know that, due to the removal of the compulsory nature of the cashless debit card in the four sites that are going to the voluntary cashless debit card, there is a very, very high chance that we will see significant increases in social harm, significant increases in domestic violence and significant increases in police presentations, hospital presentations and child neglect. You know that's the case, and that is why you have put this bandaid of additional funding onto it.

We're very happy to support this, but we reiterate that big difference between voluntary income management, choosing to be able to use this, versus having compulsory income management forced upon people, blanket across the board, which is still the case. As the opposition have just stated, there is going to be ongoing compulsory income management in far too many places across the country, despite the fact that it has been shown to fail. It does not work. It does not address the social problems that it is aimed to address. There has been so much research that shows that in fact compulsory income management could even have a negative impact. Recent research has shown that it has a negative corollary with birth weight, for example. For all of the talk about the value of the cashless debit card in a compulsory way, the evidence for it just does not stack up.

We need to increase the rate of income support. So many of the problems that so many people around this country have in managing their income, if they are living on income support payments, is that it is just far too little. It is way below the poverty line, and the impact that has on people is absolutely dire. Such people just cannot afford to eat three meals a day, even two meals a day. People cannot afford to pay the rent. People cannot afford to put clothes on their kids, to put shoes on their children's feet. People can't afford medication. In fact, people can't afford to go off and see medical practitioners if there is a gap fee involved. We need to tackle the fundamental issues that are at play here, and increasing the amount of income support to above the poverty line is an absolutely fundamental part of that.

There was absolutely wonderful research that showed that so many people were able to get their lives back on track, were able to participate in the workforce, were able to pay to get their washing machine fixed, were able to pay to get their car back on the road, were able to go off and have their medical problems treated because they had enough money to live on.

The fact that the government is choosing not to do them is a choice. Keeping people in poverty is a political choice.

I note that they are not particularly relevant to this particular piece of legislation, but can I say that the Albanese Labor government is deeply committed to building a welfare and social security system that is a strong safety net that protects vulnerable Australians and doesn't stigmatise anyone for needing income support. The government knows that those who are receiving income support are facing cost-of-living pressures, and that is why we are acting to provide relief across the government. This month has seen the largest indexation increases to government allowance in this country in more than 30 years, seeing 4.7 million Australians receive a much-needed boost to their payment, including to JobSeeker.

As we previously pointed out, your government committed all of that money but never spent a zack of it in all of the time that you were in government. We've made a commitment, and Minister Rishworth has made a commitment, that we will spend that roughly $50 million. We will be talking to the communities where the money is going to be spent, and I can assure you that we will be rolling out the assistance that that money will provide as quickly as we can.

I am just wondering whether the department has done any modelling as to the number of people it believes are likely to seek to come off the cashless debit card? Have you done any modelling or do you have any figures in relation to the number of people in the four cashless debit sites that this particular amendment refers to? How many do you believe are going to come off and how many people do you think will voluntarily stay on?

The government have said throughout this debate and even in the lead-up to it that the transition for participants needs to be staged—it needs to be slow—with individual support, which makes sense. My questions really go to the mechanics now of how people are going to transition. If someone chooses to move to voluntary income management, how will that process work and how will it be staged?

Frankly, when they were hassled—or humbugged, as some would call it—by other members of the community to hand over cash, they were able to hold up their card physically or figuratively and say, 'It's not me; it's the government that's put me on this card.' There's been a shield for them to deal with the coercion that often occurs within these communities—this is mainly from women and elderly people in the community. What measures is the government putting in place to ensure that cardholders are protected if they choose to voluntarily stay on the cashless debit card—bearing in mind that members of the community and their family and others could put extra pressure on them, now having voluntarily made this decision?

Obviously you weren't here a little bit earlier in the evening when I explained the extent to which we have consulted with the communities that are affected by the cashless debit card. We have said to those communities that we are going to give back to them what they've told us they want, which is choice. You made it compulsory. We are offering Australians a choice. I'd be confident that, hopefully, the sorts of issues you've raised won't present themselves once we get back to a situation where people can make their own decisions about their own financial management.

These are seats that were all able to see the return of coalition members—members who have been very vocal in their communities about their support of the cashless debit card. Their position on the cashless debit card was very clear to people who were voting ahead of the election in those electorates, and they were all returned. Can the minister explain that difference, please?

One of the differences between the cashless debit card and the BasicsCard was that there were different provisions as to how people could get off it or apply to get off it. With the cashless debit card, exemptions from the cashless debit card were if people were able to make the case that participation would pose a serious risk to their mental, physical or emotional wellbeing or if they could demonstrate reasonable and responsible management of their affairs. For the BasicsCard, the ability to get off the BasicsCard—people have told me—is much more limited. In particular, if a program participant on the BasicsCard is in the category of being a vulnerable welfare recipient, it's almost impossible for them to get off the card. So what I wanted to know is: in this new enhanced income tool, which people from the cashless debit card are being moved onto, what are the criteria going to be for people to be able to apply to get off that card?

I suppose the truth of the matter is that this legislation doesn't specifically deal with the issues that you've just raised. But I will say this: some people are able to apply for an exemption from income management through Services Australia. If granted, an exemption means a person is exempt from income management for 12 months unless their circumstances change.

So I'm happy for you to take it on notice and get back to me. But I think the question is very valid as to whether the same conditions are going to apply for people who are then compulsorily on this new enhanced card compared to when they were on the cashless debit card. The connection with my previous question is: if people on the BasicsCard are able to apply to go onto the new enhanced card, then the conditions may be easier for them to get off it, which I think is of great significance because we know that there are a lot of people who are currently on the BasicsCard in the Northern Territory who do not want to be on it. So, if they have an easier mechanism to actually apply to get off the BasicsCard, that would be a very big step forward which could be implemented immediately.

We want to have some certainty about the services that will be provided to support people in the transition. We've heard consistent evidence through the inquiry process that while compulsory income management is a failed program and does not work, what does work is actually being able to have services provided to people to support them, to help them overcome the disadvantage that they face and to help them to do the best they can if they are relying on income support payments that are below the poverty line. They deserve support from the government.

It would require the minister to publish this plan on the department's website and to be tabled in each house of parliament in six months time. I'm pleased to be able to support that.

We welcome the Greens amendments to table the costs of the cashless debit card program, given the significant investment made by the former government without evidence supporting the effectiveness of the cashless debit card.

As I said before, the government supports this amendment.

We would also request that, if the government is prepared to support this particular amendment, they be a little more transparent about the costs of the measures that are contained in this bill, because so far all we've heard tonight is that apparently it's commercial in confidence and is not able to be made available. The opposition will be supporting these amendments because we believe it's in the best interests of those people that are affected by this piece of legislation.

There are social problems that need to be addressed, but compulsory income management is not the way to address them. We have heard so much evidence, and there is so much evidence on the public record, of how compulsory income management is a failed tool.

As we've previously discussed, if it's voluntary, that's fine, but if it's being imposed on people as a blanket measure, it is inappropriate. It doesn't work. It's harsh, it's punitive and it's a failed measure.

Just as people in the trial sites who are being moved off compulsory income management can apply—they can pick up the phone and ring Services Australia a week after royal assent—we reckon that should be available to people in the Northern Territory as well. If people want to stay on income management, fine. But if this amendment were passed, what it would mean is that anybody who is suffering and has said, 'We do not want to be on compulsory income management. It is a failure. It is impacting our lives,' would also be able to pick up the phone and ask to be off compulsory income management, and within a week they would be off it.

This underpins our commitment to the fact that compulsory income management is having a massive, punitive, destructive impact on people and that it needs to be abolished. While we welcome the government's commitment to do an 18-month consultation process with a view to be ending compulsory income management in the Northern Territory, we think that is taking far too long. There are many people who are now languishing under the impost of compulsory income management who should be allowed off it. Our amendment would allow them to pick up the phone and to say, 'Take me off income management, please,' and that would happen.

To clarify, if they're split, (1) and (3) could be done together, and (2) and (4) together. The question is that amendments (1) and (3) on sheet 1656 be agreed to.
