        (i) that in 2011, the Government passed the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011 which removed the term 'control' from the Duties of Care which changed the longstanding principle that responsibility for safety under the Act should be allocated according to what was within reasonable and practicable control,

       <p class="italic">
        (iii) that the Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations, Senator Collins, confirmed in the 2011 Senate debate that a principal contractor retains responsibility for all safety down the contractual line with the new person conducting a business or undertaking test,

         Just so that senators are aware, we support the motion Senator Abetz has brought to the chamber. We think a two-day reporting obligation is, frankly, unreasonable. We disagree with some of the contentions in the preamble. We have added the word 'Telstra' to the list of entities whereby we are seeking to establish responsibility. Other than that, I commend this amendment to the chamber.

            This motion seeks to perpetuate the Liberal myth that the government is somehow liable for the incidents arising from Telstra's work on their telecommunications pits. Telstra
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
             CEO
            </a>
            David Thodey has made it clear. He said: 'We own the infrastructure; it is our responsibility.' When Malcolm Turnbull was asked on Sky News to justify the assertion of government liability for work done by Telstra, he would not back it up.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

            Co. will, of course, have a responsibility for the safety of work that it has commissioned through contractors, but Telstra is not a contractor when it comes to the pits; it is the landlord.
           </p>
           <p>
            Asbestos is a serious issue and it deserves a serious approach, not political game-playing. Instead of trying to politicise this issue, the coalition should work with government to ensure asbestos is always handled and disposed of safely wherever it is found. There has been no hand-washing here.

               In response to the parliamentary secretary, can I indicate that the parliamentary secretary herself confirmed in the Senate debate in 2011 that a principal contractor retains responsibility for all safety down the contractual line with a new person conducting a business or undertaking a test. Furthermore, evidence from the chief executive officer of Comcare at Senate estimates that the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_government" rel="nofollow">
                Commonwealth government
               </a>
               may be liable for these exposures under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011. Further, there is evidence that more than half of all asbestos cases since 1996 involving telecommunications pits have occurred in the past six weeks, and that is why, reluctantly, we do agree with the Greens' amendment to ensure that this Senate does get a report.
