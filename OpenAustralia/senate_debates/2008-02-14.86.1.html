        My question is directed to Senator Ludwig, the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Has the minister seen press reports that the Rudd government plans to cut back the number of sky marshals protecting Australian airline passengers? Will the government guarantee to the Australian people that the former government’s initiatives to protect Australia’s skies will be quarantined from budget cutbacks, and the number of sky marshals will not be reduced?

         May I correct the senator on the other side—in fact it falls within the

           Unfortunately, Senator Brandis was wrong about the Attorney-General’s portfolio, but I am able to assist him with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
            Home Affairs
           </a>
           portfolio of Mr Debus. The Air Security Officer program is an important part of Australia’s aviation security regime, strengthening our ability to deter, prevent and respond to terrorism on aircraft. Various layers of security are in place in the aviation sector that complement the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASO" rel="nofollow">
            ASO
           </a>
           role. The ASO deployments cover selected domestic and international flights. Clearly it is not announced as to when they will be on those domestic or international flights; it is part of their role to ensure the skies of Australia and that passengers travelling on international flights are safe on board those flights.
          </p>
          <p>
           For reasons of security of course it is government policy not to provide specific operational details about aspects of the ASO program. I am sure the senator on the other side would understand that it is difficult to provide the specifics of that particularly as it relates to the programs that are in place. I can confirm that there have been changes, of course, in the number of ASOs on selected routes internationally. It is one of those things that you can do depending on how issues might arise and the operational requirements. I am advised that these changes are in line with recommendations from an operational risk assessment review conducted for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
            AFP
           </a>
           and consistent with international best practice for the ASO program tactical operations. The deployment of ASOs on a flight is based on, as you would expect, the threat and risk assessment or the analysis that might be conducted to ensure that those areas are sufficiently covered.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am further advised that the representatives of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police_Association" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Federal Police Association
           </a>
           and the air security officers personnel provided input into this review. The risk assessment has not led to a reduction in the number of international flights covered by the program. In respect of the question that went to budget issues, that is a matter, Senator, that we will have to wait for an answer on. Those are matters that he will be able to assess, but they are budget related and I will not entertain those matters any further.

            , I ask a supplementary question. The minister will of course understand that no aspect of my question went to operational issues. Given the importance of the program, as the minister himself has acknowledged, why does he feel unable to give an assurance that the number of sky marshals will not be reduced? Why does he continue to hide behind the budget process excuse when he could perfectly well give an assurance that the numbers will not be reduced if that is indeed the government’s position?

             Clearly the senator was not listening when I answered his question. I can confirm that there have been changes in the number of air security officers on selected routine international flights. I went on to say that I am advised that those were in line with recommendations from an operational risk assessment review. Therefore when you look at the issue that he asked about you see that I have already answered that. I am happy to provide that again. In relation to the question of what may or may not be in the budget, that covers budget related matters; and I am positive the senator on the other side would understand and accept that.
