        I wish to incorporate some additional information in response to questions asked by Senator Fisher in question time earlier this week. I seek leave to incorporate the information in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

       <p class="italic">
        The document read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further information from Senator Faulkner, representing Senator Wong, in response to questions from Senator Fisher, on Tuesday 16 September.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Fisher’s questions went to the relationship between the Commonwealth’s financial support for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Government’s purchase of Toorale, and the decision by the Commonwealth to approve the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Government
        </a>
        ’s infrastructure project, the Sugarloaf Pipeline subject to a number of environmental conditions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To clarify, the decisions, while taken separately, both work to support the Government’s objectives in water policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government’s $12.9 billion Water for the Future plan, is about preparing Australia for a future with less rainfall as a result of climate change. It includes as key objectives improving the health of our rivers and using water more wisely.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We must have a concerted effort across the Basin, in purchasing water from willing sellers and improving infrastructure efficiency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purchase of Toorale Station by NSW is in accordance with the principles of buying from willing sellers at market prices. The purchase will be assisted through a substantial grant from the Commonwealth to NSW.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purchase of Toorale Station will return an average of 20 billion litres of water to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_River" rel="nofollow">
         Darling River
        </a>
        each year, peaking at up to 80 billion litres in flood years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Significant environmental assets that will benefit from this purchase include some wetlands of national importance at Menindee Lakes, as well as the Darling River itself. The recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        Sustainable Yields audit for the Barwon-Darling system also found that the middle zone of the Darling River (Between Bourke and Menindee Lakes) is in poor condition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Meanwhile, the Sugarloaf Pipeline project is about taking action in the face of drought and climate change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This pipeline will be used to convey water saved as a result of new irrigation infrastructure; savings that will be distributed between the people of Melbourne, irrigators and the environment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The conditions of approval ensure there will be no reductions in flows to the environment, and no adverse impacts on matters of National Environmental Significance, including the Lower Lakes.
