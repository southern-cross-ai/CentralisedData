        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is committed to taking action to reduce the harm caused by problem gambling and acknowledges that research can play a prominent role in informing future policy and programs and provide lessons learnt through evaluation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the Committee's report was released, the Government has, through the
        <i>
         National Gambling Reform Act (2012)
        </i>
        , established the Australian Gambling Research Centre (AGRC) from July 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AGRC will be an independent research body, housed in the Australian Institute for Family Studies (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIFS" rel="nofollow">
         AIFS
        </a>
        ), which will provide greater insight into problem gambling through the provision of a comprehensive and forward thinking research and evidence program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AGRC will be supported by an independent Expert Advisory Group on Gambling, which will provide advice to the Director of AIFS in relation to strategic directions and research plans and programs into gambling and strategies to increase the capability and capacity of researchers.

       <p class="italic">
        Response to the Joint Select Committee ' s Report
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees or agrees in-principle to many of the recommendations made by the Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government acknowledges that the Committee has made several recommendations which involve conducting or commissioning research. The Government has a strong history of funding problem gambling research which is consistent with the ongoing approach to evidence based policy, and has previously funded research into topics which relate to the areas highlighted by the Committee. The new AGRC will be the first ever dedicated national body for gambling research. Many of the Committee's recommendation could be relevant to the work of the AGRC and the Committee's report will be provided to the AGRC when established to inform their consideration of their forward work agenda.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government recognises that the Committee has also made recommendations in areas which state and territory governments have primary responsibility or where joint effort is required. These recommendations will require further consultation with jurisdictions.
