        Labor can't manage money, which means they come after yours. Already we've seen this Labor government break a promise not to touch super or franking credits. Labor is now even further divided and is looking for an excuse to come after your income tax relief due in July next year. So Labor is now going to come after your income. Now it seems it's also going to come after local road funding too.

        At least 124 projects in Queensland, with a total cost of $16.2 billion, are now at risk from Labor's infrastructure investment program review. Labor want to reduce the number of projects in Queensland, breaking another promise. Some clearly won't make it into the 10-year pipeline of infrastructure investment. At the same time Labor are looking to bring in 1.5 million more people in the next five years. So at the same time they want to bring in 1.5 million more people they're looking to cut back on the infrastructure needed to ease congestion.

        Residents on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        , including in the electorate of Fadden, should be aware that one of these projects is the next stage of the Coomera Connector. The Coomera Connector future stages business case is in planning and subject to Labor's infrastructure investment program review. This planning project will investigate the future stages of the Coomera Connector. It will complement the current approved commuter project. So $22 million has been committed, but this funding is only to plan the project. Now Labor are even reviewing having a plan, so welcome to modern Queensland where the state Labor government are doing nothing and the federal Labor government are doing nothing. If you live on the Gold Coast and you live in Fadden, good luck because Labor aren't going to do anything for you except deliver some really interesting candidates. I'll have more about that tomorrow.
