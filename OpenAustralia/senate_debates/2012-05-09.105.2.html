       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the bill is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) to improve the efficiency of the Professional Services Review (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR" rel="nofollow">
         PSR
        </a>
        ) Scheme and broaden its scope by:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill would also enable the Director of the PSR agency to re-refer matters to a new PSR Committee process if the person under review has successfully challenged a previous PSR process on the grounds that a person was not validly appointed as a PSR Panel member or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Director
        </a>
        . The PSR is a scheme set up under Part
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAA" rel="nofollow">
         VAA
        </a>
        of the Act to protect the integrity of the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs.

         Reasons
        </a>
        for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill is necessary to retrospectively validate actions taken under the Act and any flow on acts that have been brought into question as a result of the Full Federal Court's decision in Kutlu. In Kutlu the Court held that failing to consult with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Medical_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Medical Association
        </a>
        as required by the Act invalidated appointments of a number of PSR Panel Members and Deputy Directors and all PSR processes involving the invalidly appointed Panel members and Deputy Directors. The validating provisions of the bill will not affect the rights and liabilities of parties to proceedings for which leave to appeal to the High Court has been granted before the bill is assented to, if the validity of PSR Panel member or Deputy Director appointments is in issue in those proceedings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the bill does not pass Parliament by the end of the 2012
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter" rel="nofollow">
         Winter

        sittings, there is a risk that further litigation may proceed and any PSR decisions before the court may be ruled invalid and may expose the Commonwealth to further costs.
