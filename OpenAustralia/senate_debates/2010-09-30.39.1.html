        , I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 52 standing in my name today proposing the establishment of a select committee on new taxes.

             In relation to the motion, I note that the government opposed the motion. However, we recognise that the coalition had the support of Senator Xenophon and therefore had the majority. So we did not seek a division.
