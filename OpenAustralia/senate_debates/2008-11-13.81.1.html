        These amendments have been drafted in reaction to the recommendations in the very generous report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on this bill. I believe that, as a whole, those recommendations make the bill more flexible. Clause 4 provides a definition of the laws and gives some idea of key legislation—previous acts of parliament—which should be within the independent reviewer’s purview. The list is not exhaustive so that necessary flexibility is preserved. For that reason, I am prepared to accept the Greens amendment which comes under that same heading.

            (a)    make submissions to parliamentary or other committees examining bills making, amending or otherwise affecting terrorism laws; and

           <p class="italic">
            (b)    participate in reviews of terrorism laws, such as reviews by the

             Council of Australian Governments
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            I will speak briefly to each one. Hopefully, they are fairly clear. Amendment (2) goes to the fact that it is not sufficient for the independent reviewer to examine each law only once. We think that they should be revisited. We have suggested provision for a two-year review of each of the pieces of legislation listed in Senator Troeth’s first amendment. Our amendment (3) essentially goes to what I mentioned in earlier debate on this bill—that is, how the amendments proposed by Senator Bob Brown benchmark the operation of the terror laws against Australia’s human rights standards. We have suggested a broader framing of the way that those human rights obligations are drafted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amendment (4) goes to the risk that the work of the independent reviewer may simply entrench the terrorism laws as a legitimate part of Australia’s legal landscape. In our view, there are some aspects of these laws which should simply be repealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The final amendment to speak to at this point, amendment (5), is that the antiterror laws are not simply words on paper; they are also procedures and practices of authorised agencies and institutions whose powers have been expanded, in some cases, significantly. We have moved to give the independent reviewer explicit permission to participate at his or her discretion in any of these other processes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question agreed to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amendment, as amended, agreed to.

            amendment (6) on sheet 5636:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (6)    Clause 9, page 4 (line 12), omit “must”, substitute “may”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Very briefly, amendment (6) goes to a point that was made several times during the committee inquiry—that the independent reviewer should be truly independent and not be unduly tied too closely to existing organisations. For example, we believe that the reviewer should have regard to investigations conducted by agencies such as
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
             ASIO
            </a>

             AFP
            </a>
            , the Ombudsman and so on, without being compelled to suspend activities on the basis of supposed duplication. There may be some benefit to the reviewer’s ability to provide an independent voice or verification of an investigation which may already be underway.

We have proposed three years rather than five years.

                 While I am on my feet, I would like to make a very brief remark about Senator Wong’s unfortunate comments at the end of her speech during the second reading debate. To start with, up till this point the now government have gone along with or agreed that this position is a very necessary position. For them not to be agreeing with this private member’s bill I find an astounding backtrack on their supposed beliefs.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As well, as Senator Wong knows and as Senator Brandis so comprehensively pointed out, this bill has been in the parliament since March this year, firstly under Mr Georgiou’s stewardship and secondly under my direction since 23 June. So the government must know that it has been around.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That an office person from Attorney-General McClelland’s office rang me this morning and asked me to defer or withdraw the bill I found astounding. I also found it a complete lack of courtesy on Attorney-General McClelland’s part to have his office ring me rather than speak with me himself.

                  I generally have a lot of regard for Senator Troeth, but really! The first point is that there are a great many private members’ bills moved in this place. As the senator well knows, many of them sit on the

                  and are not brought on for debate and vote. I am sure that, when Senator Troeth was in government, the government did not take a range of the private members’ bills that the Greens moved on a whole range of issues—social issues and environment issues—

                       As I said, there are many private members’ bills brought on—for example, one is being debated in general business today. When Senator Troeth was in government, I am sure that not every single private member’s bill moved by a senator was taken to the coalition party room. The point is that on, I think, 11 December it was determined by the Senate that this matter be given precedence.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I again remind senators that the opposition and the Greens have ensured we are unable to finish with the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—General Law Reform) Bill 2008 as a result of giving this precedence. That is fair enough and you are entitled to do that, but it has delayed the passage through the Senate of that legislation.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       A private member’s bill being brought on for debate and vote is a very different situation, Senator Troeth—and I am sure you would concede that—to a private member’s bill being moved, as many are as a matter of course in this place.

                       In relation to the other issue, of the Attorney-General not calling you, I am sure he was extremely busy in the period prior to the House—
