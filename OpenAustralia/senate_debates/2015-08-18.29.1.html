        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson. As we mark Vietnam Veterans Day, acknowledging the 49th anniversary of the

         Battle of Long Tan

         I thank Senator Back and, before I get to the substance of his question, I acknowledge we have in here today a number of members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force

        </p>
        <p>
         Today, of course, is a very special day for this nation. It is Vietnam Veterans Day. It actually this year also marks the 50th anniversary of the arrival of our first combat troops in Vietnam, 1RAR. This is an opportunity for this nation to honour the service and sacrifice of those who fought in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
          Vietnam War
         </a>
         and to honour those 521 Australians who died in the Vietnam War and an opportunity for this chamber, the parliament and the nation to honour the families of those service men and women. Some 60,000 Australian men and women—predominately men—served in the Vietnam War. Today at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Parade" rel="nofollow">
          Anzac Parade
         </a>
         it was a great honour for me to join the Governor-General, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in a commemoration run by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT

         branch.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is fair to say that the way this nation treated a number of those men on their return from Vietnam was a disgrace and something that we should all always reflect on with a degree of shame, because they were after all serving this nation at the nation's request.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the time left for the primary question, I am pleased to announce today that we also, through

           I am very pleased that today I am also launching an essay-writing program titled 'Honouring our Vietnam veterans'. That will be available around Australia, in each electorate, for young people who will be in years 10 and 11 next year. This can be an essay, a multimedia presentation or a creative presentation based on research of two individuals or two units, including their role in and contribution to the war and the importance of honouring their service and sacrifice. The winners from each electorate will be in Canberra next year between 17 and 19 August so they can again participate in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the

          <p>
           Just before I finish, can I again remind the chamber that we will be bringing those men back from Terendak—a 50-year wrong that has now been righted.

             Again, thank you to Senator Back. I am also announcing today that we will have a dedicated grants program, consistent with our election commitment, which will enable Vietnam veterans and the wider community to participate in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
              Battle of Long Tan
             </a>
             and indeed the wider Vietnam conflict. This comes on the back of the very successful Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. It opens on 14 September. It closes on 15 October. It will enable members of the ex-service community, the Vietnam veterans community and the general community to apply for projects of between $4,000 and $20,000 which will assist in the commemoration. I will just finish on this note. Today is a very special day for this nation. Next year, particularly, this date will be a very, very special day for this nation as well.
