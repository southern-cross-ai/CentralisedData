        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. In light of the answers that we've just received, and the questions, could you please remind this Senate of the reasons for the Voice to Parliament and how it was conceived and driven by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australian" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Ciccone for that question, and for his sincere and ongoing interest in reconciliation and the project of building a better future for all Australians. It's a good question. Those opposite might like to recall that the idea of a voice came directly from Aboriginal and

                           s acceptable. So I say to all senators the future of our country is more important than our political futures, and I ask senators to reflect on whether they want to use the soul and fabric of our nation as a political battleground.

                              I invite the opposition to look to a shared national interest, not just their own narrow political interests. I invite the opposition to overcome their legacy of exploiting fear to put political fights ahead of national progress. Let's have a look at that legacy. Mr Abbott said Australia would become an economic wasteland if we acted on climate change. Mr Joyce said action on climate change would mean Australians would pay over $100 for a roast. Mr Morrison said electric vehicles would end the weekend, and Senator Cash—there's so much from Senator Cash—

                                    I know you're sensitive on this. One of the best ones was that Senator Cash said that the secure jobs, better pay bill would leave supermarket shelves bare. Then, of course, there is Mr Dutton. Mr Dutton not only didn't even attend the apology but also said it would open the government up to serious damages claims. We all know what you're up to, because that's what you always do.

                                     Order! I would ask senators to go back and review the tape and look at the behaviour across this chamber. If you think you've covered yourselves in glory, I'd ask you to look at it again, because that last—

                                     Out of order, thank you, Senator Cash; you were one of the key leaders of it. That was disgraceful. It's not respect at work. It's a disgrace to this chamber. Particularly from my left but also from my right, this is not how question time ought to be conducted, and all of you need to reflect on that.
