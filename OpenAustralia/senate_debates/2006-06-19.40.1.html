        , Senator Kemp, who was representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, was asked a question concerning child care. In accordance with Senator Kemp’s undertaking to provide additional information, I am pleased to provide the Senate with the following facts. If it is appropriate, I seek leave to have it incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>

        The answer read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to assisting child care services to provide the best quality care for all children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over $75 million a year has been committed to the Inclusion and Professional; Support Programme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ethnic Child Care Resource Unit has been funded under this programme to provide a broad range of bicultural support, training and multicultural resources to child care services. In 2005-06 ECCRU received $349,351 for these purposes. This subcontracting arrangement is due to conclude on 30 June this year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new programme is based on an open competitive process which has resulted in a consistent and integrated funding model across Australia. Funding allocations will be based on a nationally consistent funding methodology.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This takes into account the number of child care services, places and children with additional needs, with a weighting for rural and remote location.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ECCRU will now be required to compete in an open tender process to deliver services under the new Inclusion and Professional Support Programme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The tender for the ongoing delivery of bicultural support closed on 16 June. ECCRU was free to apply for this tender which is worth approximately $190,000.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It would be inappropriate for the Government to intervene in the tendering process in favour of one or more applicants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, under this programme the Federal Government will continue to fund child care services and rejects assertions to the contrary.
