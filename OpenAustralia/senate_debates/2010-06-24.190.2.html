         Drosophila suzukii
        </i>
        , or spotted-wing drosophila? Is he also aware that the Chinese fruit fly is not being considered under the Chinese—

              Obviously some senators are getting a little bit overexcited about the fact that this is the last question time before we break. It would help if people would save their exuberance until after question time.

               is currently in the process of finalising the import risk analysis for apples from China. The independent risk analysis appeals panel has received appeals and has advised the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine of its decision to disallow the claims raised.

                   ’s assertion that it does not attack fresh apple fruit is wrong, and given that any increase in major quarantine incursions could devastate the apple industry’s biosecurity and future financial viability, why is the minister ignoring the apple industry and why has he not ensured that Biosecurity Australia stop the clock and do the further scientific investigation required to properly evaluate the risk posed by the Chinese fruit fly?
