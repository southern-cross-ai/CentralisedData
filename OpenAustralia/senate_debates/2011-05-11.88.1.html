        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

        and Minister for Justice, Senator Ludwig. Given the crazy loophole that still exists that allows criminals to change their name by deed poll and thereby erase any record of their criminal history, and given the evidence by Detective Superintendent Carver to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the

         say at the outset that there are a couple of intersecting issues that you have raised. One is dealing with the change of name. As we know, births, deaths and marriages are state responsibilities, and they deal with them, so deed poll changes are not a matter for the Commonwealth as far as I am aware. But if I am wrong about that then I will correct the record. In terms of privacy, it is not a privacy matter per se if you want to change your name and deal with births, deaths and marriages in a state registry. They may require and have to keep privacy issues surrounding births, deaths and marriages and those matters. So I am just attempting to separate the two issues out. In terms of privacy, of course, this government has significant reform in this area. We have already announced the first tranche of reform of the privacy legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dealing with the specificity of your question, however, the issue around how you effectively couple up states around births, deaths and marriages to ensure that criminals cannot take advantage of the system by how you have described it, and the evidence that has been provided, is a matter that I think falls more correctly within the Attorney-General's portfolio, dealing with the type of response, the type of sharing of information and the ability for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         to work with the state police to ensure those loopholes are closed. But, to the extent that I can take that on notice and get further and better particulars in relation to the primary issue, I will.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that this was already raised two years ago in Senate estimates and the federal and state attorneys-general have been working on this, and despite there still being no meaningful progress, can the government explain why it is still dragging its feet? This has been a federal issue, working with the states. Why has this not been resolved?

           . We do seem to have jumped a fraction from the initial substance of the question—which I thought did go to privacy, which is within Minister O'Connor's portfolio, which deals with privacy reform—to an issue which now is subsumed within the Attorney-General's portfolio, dealing with the

            AFP

           and how to effectively close this particular loophole. In looking at this issue, I am not aware of it having been raised two years ago in Senate estimates. However, if it has been, I will certainly ask the Attorney-General's portfolio to have a look at Senate estimates and to examine the issue that you have raised and provide an explanation, to the extent that they are able to, as to the work that they are conducting. In and around what I think you have identified is an issue where people with—

             and the privacy legislation itself are quite complex, because you are talking about the relationships between the states, the territories and the Commonwealth in terms of investigations about transfer of information. I will take the question on notice to ensure I am correct, but my recollection is that there is a significant amount of information-sharing between the Commonwealth, through the
