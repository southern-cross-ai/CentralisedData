I remind the minister that former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd promised in 2007 that all one million laptop computers in secondary schools, that were promised by Labor, would be connected to fast, up to 100 megabytes per second fibre. Will the minister confirm that as at February this year only 12 of some 2,650 Australian secondary schools have been connected to the

                 particularly in, say,

                  New South Wales
                 </a>
                 ? They are not actually building an NBN, but put that aside. What would help connect the schools is the

                 government withdrawing its instruction to the schools in New South Wales not to connect to the NBN. So don't come in here and play a few games. The O'Farrell government has stood in the way of connecting schools in New South Wales to the

                 . You can sit there and shake your head, but that is the fact. Those schools could be connected, but the O'Farrell government keeps getting in the way, keeps opposing, keeps not facilitating and keeps obstructing. Senator Mason, you should ensure that you are given a full briefing on the behaviour of the New South Wales government. Whether it is connecting fibre on the poles of a New South Wales electricity company or connecting fibre to the schools—
