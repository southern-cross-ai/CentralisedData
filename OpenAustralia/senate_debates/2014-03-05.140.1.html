           have completed a joint review into the actions of the ADF and Customs in relation to Australian vessels that entered Indonesian waters. The review identified that there was a clear government intention to achieve the aims of the operation with a focus on safety and effectiveness without compromising Indonesian sovereignty. The breaches were inadvertent and the review found that there was nothing in the strategic guidance provided for the operation that required, implied or suggested that a breach of Indonesian sovereignty would be acceptable. The Australian government has formally apologised to the Indonesian government. Australian Customs

           and Chief of the Defence Force have accepted the joint review's findings and recommendations and have directed the implementation of the recommendations. The motion is, once again, nothing more and nothing less than a Greens political stunt.
