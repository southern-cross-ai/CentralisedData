        We can protect great white sharks in Australia, and we can protect the people who share the ocean with them. It doesn't have to be one or the other. Great white sharks are a protected species in Australia, listed as vulnerable to extinction. But they're also the most feared predator in our oceans, rightly or wrongly. When we see a traumatic and tragic spate of events, as we've seen in

        Premier to get down to Port Lincoln this weekend. Take your advisers or get the relevant ministers and take the opportunity to meet with these experts who know what they're talking about. There are a lot of things that the South Australian government can do to reduce risks. Primarily, do what the
