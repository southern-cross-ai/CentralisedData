        I would firstly like to commend and congratulate Senator Urquhart for highlighting again the failure of the member for Braddon, Mr Whiteley, to stand up for his constituents. He has failed time and time again in this parliament to stand up for his community. That brings me to the point of my contribution today, which is again about the failure of Tasmania's federal Liberal MPs—Mr Whiteley, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Nikolic—to stand up for their constituents.

        I recently had the opportunity to visit the Radiology Tasmania facilities in Hobart. I was accompanied by Mr Shorten; by the Labor candidate for Lyons,

        ; and by the Labor candidate for Denison,

        . We were briefed by the owner and radiologist, Dr Pip Taplin, on the impacts of the Turnbull government's cuts to bulk-billing incentives for pathology and radiology services which are due to take effect from 1 July of this year. These cuts will mean Tasmanians will have to pay more for blood tests, X-rays and scans. To call these cuts irresponsible is an understatement. These cuts will hurt, and people know this.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have heard from hundreds of Tasmanians who are concerned about the Turnbull government's decision to slash the bulk-billing incentive for pathology and imaging. And based on yesterday's contributions in the other place by the members for Lyons and Braddon, I would say that they too have heard from these Tasmanians. But instead of standing up for their constituents, for their communities and for Tasmanians, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Whiteley attacked the health providers. In essence, they ignored their constituents' views. Singing from the same song book, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Whiteley highlighted the incredible campaign that is running on this issue. Mr Whiteley actually said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People coming in to have their pathology tests are being asked to sign a petition to say that an incentive that was put in place of between $1.40 and $3.40, depending on the respective schedule number, is going to require payments after 1 July of $50, $60, $70, $80, $100. This is extraordinary.
       </p>
       <p>
        And, I have to agree, this is extraordinary—though I doubt we would find it extraordinary for the same reason. It is extraordinary that Mr Whiteley, Mr Hutchinson and those opposite do not understand that the changes they have flagged will force patients to pay up-front for tests and treatment. That is the reality. It is extraordinary that they cannot understand that it is not simply a matter of people having to find the extra money to cover the gap. It is extraordinary that they cannot understand that having to find $100, $80, $70, $60 or $50 to pay for tests and treatments up-front will actually stop many individuals and families from getting necessary pathology and imaging.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is extraordinary is how out of touch those opposite are. We are talking about people delaying and avoiding necessary tests and treatments. For people who require regular scans and treatments, for those with cancer or other serious health issues such as diabetes or heart conditions, this could have a devastating impact on their lives. A woman called Pam told me in a letter that she will have to put off appointments for pathology. Her husband has type 2 diabetes, heart problems and arthritis. As a result, he has to have numerous blood tests. Pam said her husband is adamant that if he has to pay he simply will not go. She ended her letter by saying, 'I cannot believe that, after working all our lives, the government can do this to pensioners.' This is what I have heard time and time again from people across Tasmania. The Turnbull government's $650 million cuts are going to have a serious impact on many patients, forcing them to pay higher fees and, in some cases, skip important scans and tests. These cuts are not only unfair; they are also out of touch and incredibly short sighted. What I can say to those many hundreds of people who have emailed me is that Labor will not support this fundamental attack on Medicare because we believe that every Australian needs access to affordable and quality health—
