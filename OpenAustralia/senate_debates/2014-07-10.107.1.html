        I share Senator Siewert's concern for youth unemployment. All unemployment is a scourge. It is something that we all should be united in overcoming in this chamber, especially for the young people of our nation, who are seeking to make their way. That is why as a first item of business this government is concerned with restoring the economy. Restoring the economy includes getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax, getting rid of red and green tape, reintroducing the Australian Building and Construction Commission and all the other changes we have made, including trying to get the budget back into shape.
       </p>
       <p>
        Turning to the specifics of workforce exclusion: that, of course, is a real blight, and I might say that, for young people, the figure you quoted of about 12½ per cent I think might be 13½. That is still too high, but in some areas like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         North Adelaide
        </a>
        and my home state of Tasmania it is considerably higher. That is why the government is concerned with doing everything it possibly can to achieve young Australians getting into a job. Part of that includes an enhanced Work for the Dole scheme. It includes an enhanced scheme to assist young apprentices with getting through their apprenticeship. We know that, if young people are able to get through their apprenticeships—

          , I rise on a point of order. We have less than 30 seconds left. I would really appreciate it if the minister could address the specific issue, which is around the lack of income support for six months. I am sure the minister understands the nature of my question. How does that relate to work readiness?

            report, which the government is considering. It is a very comprehensive review of a range of welfare assistance. We believe certain incentives are needed to get young Australians into work and for them to avail themselves of the opportunities.

             , I ask a supplementary question. Organisations like the Brotherhood of St Laurence have proposed that the role of government is not to punish job seekers but rather to strengthen links between employers, service providers, educators and young people. Has the government considered that, instead of investing in a punitive job services approach, they could invest in transition processes and job brokers who would work with businesses and others to create work, rather than punishing young people?

              Senator Siewert, I think, hit the nail on the head at the very end of her question about the need to create work. That is exactly what this government's economic agenda is all about. It is the social dividend that comes from getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax, getting rid of the red and green tape, restoring the budget, and reintroducing the Australian Building and Construction Commission. To say that those sorts of policies somehow punish the young is to misunderstand the economic factors that do need to be manipulated to ensure that we get the social outcomes that Senator Siewert and I want to achieve—that is, greater employment opportunities for our young Australians. That is why, for example, in the education reforms there will be another 80,000 places created and made available for young Australians. There will be more positions hopefully in the apprenticeship area as well.

               , I ask a further supplementary question. The Anglicare report released today is a timely reminder that we need to work with individuals and to view them as individuals. Does the government recognise this changing relationship between workers and employees, where the nature of work has changed substantially to more casual and part-time jobs and that a part-time job is in fact a way into longer-term employment? Why has the government not considered that the business wage subsidies they are going to be providing should also be made available for part-time work not just full-time work?

                Once again, it is a bit spooky, but I am agreeing with Senator Siewert. There is a need to tailor things for individuals and that is why I look forward to the Greens supporting our changes to the individual flexibility arrangements that we are going to be moving to the Fair Work Act, because it is through individual flexibility arrangements that more young Australians will be given opportunities.

                   and his changes there. I asked him specifically about the wage subsidy and whether it relates to part-time jobs. I would really appreciate it if he would answer that particular question.

                    Again, Senator Siewert, your question was broader than just that. I will draw the minister's attention to the question. The minister is being relevant.

                     Everybody wants a full-time job. There has been, regrettably, a degree of casualisation in the workforce with part-time jobs. The good news is, if you do get yourself a part-time job or a seasonal job, there is a greater chance you can then move on to full-time employment and that is what we as a government are pursuing.
