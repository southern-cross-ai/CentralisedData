               Well, I still do not agree with that anyway—and it would have been nice to have been told that you were going to move an amendment. If you had done so and informed us as to the detail we could perhaps have saved some time by negotiation and discussion; that has not happened.

                  by leave—I want to make it clear that the Greens’ position on this motion is that we will support it if the numbers are changed to three, three, one. That is in the spirit of a reference to do with committees that we had before the Senate a short while ago. I have indicated this to Senator Bushby. Otherwise, we are left with no option but to oppose the motion. I think the amendment ought to be considered.

                   by leave—I wish to make a short statement, and this is perhaps directed to the opposition: my position is that I support the motion of Senator Bushby that this matter go to the select committee, but I think the appropriate thing is for the composition of the committee to reflect the composition of the chamber, and that it be three government members, three opposition members and one crossbencher. I do not know whether that could be dealt with. Perhaps the opposition could reconsider their position in respect of that.

                         . Given that there is obviously a bit of confusion about what is being proposed here, could it be deferred until a later hour? I seek leave to defer it to a later hour.

                              No, leave was not granted in this chamber. To my knowledge, leave was not sought—and I was listening pretty carefully—nor was it granted. It will be if it is. I think we have a problem if senators just stand up and speak, particularly when debate is constrained in this sort of matter. I might say in conclusion to my point of order—and that is my substantive point of order—that this shows the absurdity of dealing with these sorts of matters when formality has been granted. It would have been better, of course, in relation to this matter if it had been dealt with in a different manner.

If she did not, we all agree with Senator Faulkner: you cannot just get up in this chamber and chat away; you have to seek leave. I thought Senator Coonan did, but if she did not I am sure she will seek leave. What she wants to do, as I understand, is to move this motion to a later hour this day.

This is the difficulty with all of these things: when you choose to do something, you can have consequences—so, as long as we understand that, if we defer it for a later hour, it becomes a matter that can be debated.
