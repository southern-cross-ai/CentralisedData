        The bill to amend the

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         Infrastructure Facility Act 2016

        ('the Act') proposes to:

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government committed to increase the Facility's appropriation in the October 2022-23 Budget, and this amendment legislates that commitment. By providing the Facility with an additional $2 billion to provide financial assistance to businesses and communities in Australia's north, this Government is demonstrating its commitment to developing the north. To date, the Facility has committed over $4 billion to projects, generating substantial public benefit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By extending the definition of 'Northern Australia' to the Indian Ocean Territories, this Government is empowering the Facility to provide financial assistance for the development of economic infrastructure that provides a basis for economic growth or stimulates population growth in the Indian Ocean Territories. Allowing the Indian Ocean Territories to benefit from financial assistance provided by the Facility will enable local businesses to diversify and create jobs in line with our core principle of 'No One Left Behind, No One Held Back'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Clarifying that the persons to which section 7(1A)(b) refers are indigenous persons, and that an objective of the Act is to benefit indigenous persons, removes potential ambiguity in the Act. Further, it makes clear this Parliament's expectation that the Facility is empowered to provide financial assistance for the development of Northern Australia economic infrastructure, including for the benefit of indigenous persons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government is fully committed to advancing indigenous outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill being introduced today will, if enacted, deliver these outcomes for Australia's North.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.
