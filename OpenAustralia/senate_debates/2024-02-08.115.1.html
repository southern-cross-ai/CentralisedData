        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care, Senator Gallagher. In December 2022 the government introduced a star rating system for aged-care facilities. The idea was to provide accessible and reliable information about the quality of aged care. Recently it has been reported that experts have criticised the system, claiming that it's a poor functioning system resulting in high rankings for potentially substandard facilities. They say the data provided by aged-care facilities is not vetted or checked thoroughly, meaning it isn't accurate. Minister, do you believe that Australians can rely on this system to ensure they or their loved ones receive the best-quality aged care?

         I thank Senator Tyrrell for the question and for her ongoing advocacy around aged care and residents of aged care, in particular residents of aged care in Tasmania. The Minister for Aged Care, through her reform agenda, is working incredibly hard to improve the standard of care across the aged-care system. Remember, we did inherit a system that had been heavily criticised under a royal commission, with a report that was titled
         <i>
          N
         </i>
         <i>
          eglect
         </i>
         . That report outlined the fact that the system was under enormous pressure, that there wasn't adequate investment into that system and that the system needed to change in a number of ways.
        </p>
        <p>
         We needed to ensure that appropriate investments were made into the workforce; we have done that. We also needed to make sure that there was more accountability and transparency around the care that is provided and the quality and the care minutes in particular that residents received, and those aged-care facilities should have to measure the quality of the care that they provide in a very public way—which is what the star rating system is about. When you introduce those kinds of rating systems, it's more about driving improvements than about punishment because services will work hard to improve the star rating they get in order to project the quality of care and, therefore, attract residents to that service. It also gives families and residents—or would-be residents—information about those services that are either exceeding or going to a high level of quality of care. For anyone that needs to go into aged care, I think their families are always looking for the best possible place for the best possible care for their loved ones, and I think the star rating drives that kind of reform.

           Across the four criteria assessed for a star rating, 'resident experience' counts towards one-third of the overall rating. However, an assessment can be determined by using as little as 10 per cent of the residents. This means that the provider could potentially rig the assessments by choosing which residents participate in the survey. Minister, is it possible that ratings have been manipulated through the use of dodgy data?

            I will come back if there's anything further that I can add to this. When you introduce a system, it's always appropriate that you look at how that system is being implemented and that you ensure the data being used is appropriate and reflects the true picture—and it's not only star ratings; it's also, through the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, the ability to do other and further checks and to respond to any complaints that are made.
           </p>
           <p>
            In aged care, some of the reasons around the threshold of the number of residents that might participate in that survey would be lower, potentially because of the nature of the care requirements of some of the residents. It is an important part of the star rating system, but nobody in aged care—and I've met a lot of providers and a lot of families over the years—would be wanting to see a system that didn't provide an accurate representation of the quality of care in those facilities. If there is any one you're worried about, we will be happy to follow up.

              The latest Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Performance Report shows that nearly one in five residential aged-care services were less than fully compliant, yet many of these services are still receiving four- and five-star compliance ratings in the star ratings system. Minister, does the government admit that this system is a failure and is putting people at risk?

               No, I wouldn't accept that and the government wouldn't accept that. I think it is an important area of improving transparency and accountability across the residential aged-care sector. But it is a new system and, where we are getting feedback, that feedback should be looked at and assessed to see if there is anything to that. You can see where star ratings have been applied in other areas of public information. It is much more about driving improvements rather than penalising and punishing. That's the whole idea of introducing one. It sits alongside other quality measures that are required for the aged-care sector. But look, we accept that the standard of care in aged care hasn't been what Australian people expected or what elderly Australians expect and should receive. The sector is under enormous reform but I'm confident that through the work of the minister, aged-care providers and the department we will get there.
