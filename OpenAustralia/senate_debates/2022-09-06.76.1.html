        My question is for the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, let's talk about the Australian Future Leaders Foundation. It's a foundation with no website. It appears to have no office, no staff and no previous record. When the grant was approved there was no competitive process and a merits review wasn't done. Despite all that, the previous government promised the foundation $18 million to set it up and $4 million a year to run it.

        -General might think it's a great idea, but, with all due respect, Minister, there's no detail, let alone transparency. Where does your government stand on continuing the support for the foundation?

         I thank Senator Tyrrell for her question and will say that I have a little bit of knowledge on thisâ€”although I suspect that my colleague Senator Gallagher, as in most things, has more. I am aware of this issue because it came to light, as you correctly identify, under the previous government and it was an issue at estimates that we asked some questions about, and some of the issues that you refer to were raised by people in the context of preparing for that estimates round. I understand that that measure, along with a number of other measures that were announced by the previous government, is under review and will be considered in the context of the budget preparation.

           The Morrison government gave the Australian Future Leaders Foundation 'deductible gift recipient' status last March. Apparently the amendments were written up and approved a lot faster than normal. Is your government reviewing that decision?

            I can seek further advice on that, but I would anticipate that it would be relevant to the review in the context of the budget, as I've described.

              Minister, media reports suggest that the Morrison government's promise to give the foundation funding overlapped with the former Prime Minister's moves to take over more ministries.

              -General was involved in both decisions. I'm not suggesting he's done anything wrong, but aren't you worried about the public perception it creates?

               I am not advised and nor am I aware of how those decisions correlate or don't correlate with some of the media reporting of the swearing in of Mr Morrison to a number of other portfolios, which has subsequently come to light. So, I'm not in a position to give you an answer on that. Obviously in relation to the issue of multiple ministries the Prime Minister has commissioned an inquiry. There is a view that many Australians have expressed, which I think you are referring to, that it would be a good thing if there was more transparency around those sorts of arrangements. But obviously the review will deal with that.
              </p>
              <p>
               In relation to the

               status, again, I'll take advice and see what I'm able to give you, but I would assume that that's likely to be relevant to the consideration of a measure through the budget process.
