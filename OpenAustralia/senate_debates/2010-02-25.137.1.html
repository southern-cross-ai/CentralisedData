       Debate resumed from 4 February, on motion by
       <b>
        Senator Parry:

      </p>
      <p pwmotiontext="moved">
       That the Senate take note of the document.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to very quickly talk about the implementation of an importation program for beef on Monday. It is clear that there are differing views in relation to this matter. I acknowledge that the Cattle Council, for example, do not share the views of some others. But this is clearly an issue that is concerning the Australian people. To date I have not seen Minister Crean or Minister Burke actually give a clear indication of what the tracking mechanism is to ensure that BSE infected beef is not imported into this country. If there is some tracking mechanism which can satisfy peopleâ€™s concerns, I am prepared to accept on the face of it that we could probably continue with this program. But at the moment there is no indication from Minister Crean or Minister Burke about this matter. There is very considerable community discontent about it. We do, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, have a reputation for clean, green and disease-free agriculture. But this is a serious issue. This is not about protectionism for Australian farmers; it is actually about making sure that the reputation we have built up is not tarnished by a decision to bring in beef from those countries that have BSE.
      </p>
      <p>
       It beggars belief that we would put at risk our reputation and our industry for the sake of importing this beef. Let us have a genuine discussion about how the government is going to track where this beef is coming from. If we cannot be convinced of that then, quite frankly, I do not think we can be convinced of the integrity of this program. It starts on Monday; this beef will start coming in on Monday. This is a serious and urgent matter and I urge both ministers to address it suitably and appropriately. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leave granted; debate adjourned.
