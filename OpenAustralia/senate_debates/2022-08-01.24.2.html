        On a different topic, today I would like to acknowledge the work of Mrs Annie Revie, who has resigned from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Council
        </a>
        after serving as mayor of this beautiful island paradise for almost four years. Mrs Revie stood down from the leadership role three months shy of Tasmania's upcoming local government elections and plans to focus more on her health and wellbeing. Acting Flinders mayor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         David Williams
        </a>
        said he had enjoyed working with Annie over the past four years and recognised her dedication to the role of mayor and the efforts she put into making our community a better place to live in.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have witnessed Mrs Revie's commitment to this community for myself during a number of trips to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Island
        </a>
        , most recently sitting down with her just a few months ago as she explained the priorities for the island community and the unique challenges faced by residents in this remote archipelago. During that same visit, I inspected the newly sealed section of road that leads to Palana. Mrs Revie championed for this six-kilometre section to be sealed, with this advocacy also leading to the Tasmanian government taking ownership of the road, as it linked to the existing state owned road that connects Flinders' main port and airport.
       </p>
       <p>
        Flinders Island also embarked on an innovative tourism program during Mrs Revie's tenure. The two-year Islander Way project was created by the Flinders Island community with Brand Tasmania, focusing on the future of tourism in the Furneaux island group. The Islander Way uses community led regenerative tourism principles to co-create the region's future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met Mrs Revie when she was the principal of West Launceston Primary School, when my children were students there. Each time we have met on Flinders Island, she has remembered this, always taking an interest in what my children—who are now adults—are doing. She has an amazing recollection for all of her students, and I'm sure she has impacted many lives throughout her extensive teaching career. We appreciate and thank you for all your service, Mrs Revie.
