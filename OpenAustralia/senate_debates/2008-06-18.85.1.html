       <p>
        I am delighted to table the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity on the inaugural annual report of the Integrity Commissioner, 2006-07. The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity—or ACLEI, as it is more commonly known—was established on 30 December 2006 to provide independent oversight of Commonwealth agencies with a law enforcement function.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to note that ACLEI was set up in response to serious corruption risks and not in response to perceived corruption practices. Its establishment reflects the intent to enhance integrity in law enforcement at a national level and provide greater assurance to the general public. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the

        </a>
        and the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Authority" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        currently fall under ACLEI’s jurisdiction. Other Commonwealth agencies with a law enforcement function are able to be brought within ACLEI’s jurisdiction by regulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a foundation document, the annual report provides a very informative review of the history that led to the formation of ACLEI, including the path to establishing state based law enforcement integrity agencies and concerns with the limits of existing national integrity mechanisms. The committee was satisfied that the annual report of the Integrity Commissioner, 2006-07, complies with all reporting requirements. Given the infancy of the organisation, the inquiry provided the committee with an opportunity to satisfy itself that the development of the structures and processes that enable ACLEI to conduct its work are on track.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was clear from the evidence received during the inquiry that additional resources are required for ACLEI to undertake its increasing workload. I am pleased to note that this was recognised in the 2008 budget, with an allocation of additional funding of $7.5 million over four years. As ACLEI continues to establish its various functions and move to full corporate functionality, the committee will monitor the following: (1) developments on the implementation of workplace and corporate initiatives and internal governance mechanisms, and (2) trends and issues in matters notified and referred.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend Professor John McMillan for his significant achievements as Acting Integrity Commissioner in the first six months of ACLEI’s establishment, and extend this commendation to the current Integrity Commissioner, Mr Philip Moss, and to his staff. As ACLEI is the first Commonwealth integrity body of its kind, those entrusted with the task of establishing ACLEI are, to an extent, dealing with uncharted territory. The magnitude of this task should not be underestimated.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank ACLEI, the

        witnesses who gave their time to give evidence at the public hearing for this inquiry. I also thank my fellow committee members and the secretariat for the work they have put into producing this report. Finally, I would like to note my appreciation of the open and cooperative manner that the Integrity Commissioner, Mr Philip Moss, has taken in his dealings with the committee. The committee looks forward to building a productive working relationship with Mr Moss and officers from ACLEI.
