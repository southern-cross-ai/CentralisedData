        AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (LIABILITY AND INSURANCE) BILL 2012
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill amends the framework for the liability of air carriers in the event of an aircraft accident. The framework is established by the Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act 1959 and the Damage by Aircraft Act 1999. The amendments address some of the shortcomings in the current framework that were identified in the development of the 2009 National Aviation Policy White Paper.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The key amendments include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill implements reforms agreed in the 2009 National Aviation Policy White Paper. The level of compensation payable to victims of air craft accidents has not been updated since 1994. From 1994 inflation has increased the cost of living by approximately 2.7 per cent per year. This represents a real imbalance between the compensation currently payable under the CACL Act and the increase in the cost of living since the bill’s inception. Delaying the progress of the bill will impact on the ability of air crash victims to obtain equitable compensation in the event of an aviation disaster.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill was passed unopposed in the House of Representatives.

        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the Federal Magistrates Court commenced operation in 2000 its jurisdiction has expanded and the number and complexity of the cases coming before it have increased. It is the only federal court with a program of regular regional circuits. The current name of the Federal Magistrates Court and title of Federal Magistrates does not adequately capture the increasingly complex work undertaken by the court and its judicial officers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Attorney General proposes that legislation to implement the changes be passed so that the changes of title for the Court and Federal Magistrates can commence early in 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill provides a legislative basis for the changes to the name of the Federal Magistrates Court and title of Federal Magistrates, and is uncontroversial.

        SOCIAL SECURITY AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER 2012 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill would introduce several measures from the 2012-13 Budget. The first of these would provide for a 12-month extension from 1 January 2013 of the welfare reform trial in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York" rel="nofollow">
         Cape York
        </a>
        area. In a significant boost to Indigenous education, the bill would also amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to increase the Act’s legislative appropriation for several education initiatives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill would also make some non-Budget amendments to clarify current Government policies and improve the operation of existing legislation. These amendments would include minor clarifications to the schoolkids bonus legislation, payments under which are due to start from 1 January 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Cape York welfare reform trial began in 2008, but is currently due to end on 31 December 2012. Passage of the bill in the 2012 Spring sittings would allow the trial to continue for 12 months, as announced in the Budget. To date, the trial has made a real and lasting difference in the lives of Indigenous people in Cape York, bringing improvements in school attendance, care and protection of children, and community safety. The 12-month extension would provide an opportunity to build on the success of the initiatives already underway, including the completion of an independent evaluation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The minor clarifications relating to the schoolkids bonus also need to be passed in the 2012 Spring sittings, in time for the first payments of the new bonus to be made to families from 1 January 2013.
