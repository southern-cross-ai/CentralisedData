         . I advise the Senate that there are two aged-care facilities in the area that have activated their emergency management plans and are on standby to evacuate as a last resort, should that need eventuate, and there are a couple of others that are preparing. I acknowledge the staff, who have been working around the clock to make sure that the residents of those facilities are kept safe and comfortable.

         The vaccination of Australians against COVID-19 will commence later this month. We are working to ensure an orderly rollout to priority groups which is safe, effective and well explained. Our rollout strategy will be one of the largest logistics exercises ever seen in Australia. Our government is investing $6.3 billion, with almost $1.9 billion for medical bodies, logistics companies, general practices and community pharmacies to roll out and administer the vaccine. We expect there will be thousands of sites that will support the rollout, ensuring that Australians can access a vaccine regardless of where they live.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia's world-class primary health workforce will be the cornerstone of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout across the nation. The health workforce, including doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists and many other allied health professionals, has continually risen to the challenges of COVID-19 over the past year. It will play a pivotal role in supporting the rollout of a vaccine to all Australians.

            Australia has developed a road map based on a phased approach. The purpose of phasing is to identify and make the vaccine available to high-risk Australians first. Our priority—phase 1A—is being given to aged-care and disability residents and frontline staff, healthcare workers and quarantine and border workers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Phase 1B, where up to 14.8 million doses will be made available, includes those aged over 70 years. Phase 1B also includes Aboriginal and

            </a>
            people over 55, younger adults with an underlying medical condition or disability and critical and high-risk workers, including defence, police, fire and emergency services. Phase 2A includes adults aged over 50, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over 18 and other critical and high-risk workers.

               Thanks, Senator Brockman. Phase 2B covers the balance of Australia's adult population and phase 3 is for those aged under 16, if recommended.

               The Therapeutic Goods Administration has provisionally approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use in Australia. Rollout of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
                AstraZeneca
               </a>
               international dose is being considered by the TGA today and is on track for an early March rollout, subject to TGA approval and final shipping confirmation. That's for the AstraZeneca vaccine. Our comprehensive public information campaign will keep Australians fully informed and up to date about the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines as they become available, including when, how and where to get vaccinated.
