         Tertiary Education

        , Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations in his capacity representing the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Senator Evans. Will the minister unequivocally rule out this government approving a national history curriculum for years 11 and 12 if it includes teaching students about supposed ‘controversies surrounding the purpose and function of memorial sites and commemorative events’ such as those at Gallipoli?

         I think Senator Mason used half of his time in his question reading out the titles, so we will have to see if we can do an abbreviation. I thank the senator for the question. We have strong bipartisan support for the development of an Australian curriculum and I understand it is progressing well. The time frame agreed by education ministers for implementation is on track and the commitment remains strong. Australian curriculum for English, mathematics, science and history from kindergarten to year 10 will be ready for implementation from 2011 and will be substantially implemented by the end of 2013. As the senator would know, implementation is a matter for those individual jurisdictions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The senator refers to some press coverage that was sparked by a statement by an officeholder of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
          RSL
         </a>
         the other day. I want to confirm that the Australian curriculum will help students learn about the Anzac tradition of Gallipoli, Anzac Day and other important events and symbols in Australian history. The draft Australian history curriculum for years 11 and 12 was released for public consultation earlier this year. Feedback has now been considered by the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority, the expert body overseeing the development of the Australian curriculum. This government thinks that it is important for children to understand the service and sacrifice of the men and women who served Australia in wars and in peace operations, and obviously it will continue to do so. But it is the case that that feedback process is occurring. I am advised though by ACARA that there is no intention of diminishing the role war memorials and commemorative events play in recognising Australia’s fallen heroes and the way their spirit of sacrifice connects our past to the present.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister agree with the sentiment expressed by the spokesman for the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority, who is quoted as saying that a view should be incorporated into the national curriculum that asks, ‘Should we be glorifying Gallipoli’?

           I have not seen the quotation or the context in which it was given, but I do not agree with any suggestion that we should not honour the landings at Gallipoli, the bravery of Australian troops and the important place that has in Australia’s history and its development and in our broader culture and our understanding of ourselves. I was honoured to be able to attend the 2005 90th anniversary of the landings with Senator Bishop and Senator Barnett, among others. Prime Minister Howard was there. I regard it as a very important point in Australia’s history, and Australians will continue to recognise that. The number of young Australians flocking to Gallipoli’s anniversaries is a sign of that ongoing engagement. So I do not agree with any suggestion there should be any downgrading of our recognition of the role of Gallipoli.

            , I ask a second supplementary question. Will the minister be delaying the introduction of the new national curriculum to ensure that this crucial part of Australia’s history is not downgraded and ensure that our history is properly reflected in our national curriculum taught to the next generation of young Australians?

            <p>
             I think that is a couple of leaps in logic,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
              Mr President
             </a>
             . I understand the concern the senator is expressing and his interest in such matters. I also note that I am not keen for us to try to devise the curriculum in the parliament or have a repeat of some of the occurrences that occurred under the Howard government, where the Prime Minister personally took charge of writing the citizenship test and the booklet that accompanied it. I do not think that is a proper role of parliamentarians.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have a proper process established where the Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority is seeking feedback on the draft curriculum. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
              RSL
             </a>
             ’s feedback will be an important part of that, as will others, and I think all of that will be taken into account. And as you know, the states then will be involved in the process of signing off. But I am advised there is no intention of diminishing the role that war memorials and commemorative events play in recognising Australia’s fallen. It is certainly the view of this government that that remains an important part of our history curriculum.
