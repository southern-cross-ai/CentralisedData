         The Department of Education

        , Employment and Workplace Relations has advised that the Booroongen Djugan Aboriginal Corporation is a member of both the 1EP Employment and Economic Development and Business Support panels. Currently the organisation has two
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEP" rel="nofollow">
         IEP
        </a>
        contracts valued at approximately $517,000. These contracts are to place Indigenous people who have a disability into jobs across various industries in the New South Wales Mid North Coast region and train indigenous people (targeting school leavers) in the aged care industry at Booroongen Djugans's aged care facilities. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has advised the Minister that there is no outstanding IEP application from Booroongen Djugun Aboriginal Corporation.

        The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has advised that the Replay Group currently receives funding under the IEP for two contracts valued at $2,295,000. A variation to one of its current contracts was approved in late 2012 to allow the placement of an extra 37 indigenous participants. The contract variation represents a total contract value increase of $185,000.

         The Government
        </a>
        remains committed to the IEP and will fund over $650 million to the program over the next four years to 2015-16. Growing interest in the IEP from employers and providers, coupled with the expansion of the number of IEP panel members, has seen a significant increase in demand. The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations consider applications against existing selection criteria, and is progressively working through existing applications on a priority basis.

        The Government is committed to a comprehensive approach to closing the employment gap, involving boosting education and training, creating better transition pathways for school leavers and strengthening employment services for
