         and others—and, importantly, high school science teachers. A great number of high school students have been working away over the last eight months in 17 schools across the country on the first Young Australians' Plan for the Planet. It is an initiative that gets young people looking at the challenges we face, drawing on their

         The government is supporting this year's National Science Week by providing $500,000 in grants for 39 projects under the Inspiring Australia—Science Engagement Program. More than 1.3 million people are registered for more than 2,000 events across the country through to 20 August. There are hands-on activities, competitions, plenty to do online, astronauts at the

         explaining to people what it takes to have a mission to Mars—this sort of thing—and a young guy who did a video trying to explain how it is that cats when they fall off a table land on their feet, and that's being used by space scientists to work out how we should walk in space. No, it's about exciting the scientific curiosity of our young people and getting more young people involved in science, technology, engineering and maths.

                In my portfolio science has its own importance in its own right. It is critical, though, to see science in the broader context of innovation and industry. The National Science Statement, released in March, set out the government's vision for an Australian society engaged in and enriched by science. The government will take a strategic view of skills and talent, ensuring Australians have the broad base of

                skills required for the workforce of the future. Through our National Innovation and Science Agenda's Inspiring Australia—Science Engagement Program, we are promoting participation in STEM through sponsorship grants, Citizen Science Grants, the Maker Projects and the Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship grants. We will be investing over $10.3 billion in research and development, including $3.6 billion in university research and a record $794 million for the

                . Under our Innovation and Science Agenda, looking to the longer term, we are investing $2.3 billion over 10 years to support our critical research infrastructure.
