        I have a series of questions that I would like to ask, and I know that Senator Xenophon does to, so perhaps we can explore things topic by topic.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has committed $1 million in additional funding—as I understand it through the letter that has gone to Ms Macklin, the opposition shadow on social services—specifically for the trial in Ceduna. My first question is: will there be similar levels of funding for the other trial sites, such as in the East Kimberley, and whatever other towns the government manages to get to agree to this process? Will there be similar levels of funding, or is it just because this one is the one that the government needs to get over the line to get this legislation over the line?

        <p>
         I also have a question. Minister, if you remember, at the Senate inquiry we asked questions about the availability of funding for wraparound services. At that time the department said there was no designated amount and that there was no cap, that it would actually be worked out with the community at the time. I am very interested to hear whether there has been any further discussion beyond those generalisations that we received at the committee stage, because now we are actually talking about specifics.

          Thank you, colleagues. In relation to other communities, there will be support packages that will be developed in a similar way as the one for Ceduna. But the first thing that has to happen is that the government needs to announce the intention for a trial in a particular location. Once that announcement has been made the government will work with local communities through a co-design process on the support package for the trial location.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is important to see this as enabling legislation. We are in a position where we can confirm Ceduna and where we have announced the support package arrangements for that. But once other trial sites are finalised and announced, then there will be a similar process that will be gone through with those communities to work out similar support arrangements. In relation to Senator Moore's specific question about funding and whether there is a pot of money, we will find the resources that are needed for these support packages.

           That leads me exactly on to my next question: where is this funding coming from? There was $270 million cut out of the

In relation to the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, I will seek further advice from officials as to whether I can give a more specific answer.

               I think that a lot of social service organisations would be fascinated to hear that there is a lot of money in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSS" rel="nofollow">

               that can be suddenly found just like that for these sorts of services. You cut $270 million out of the budget for this sort of thing, and all of a sudden we can find more money? Not that I am opposed to finding more money, but I am just fascinated that we can suddenly find money for these services when you cut some of them previously. Could you please give us a bit more detail about where the money is coming from?

                has a budget of $100-plus billion per year, and what we are talking about here are important amounts of money but relatively modest amounts of money, so I am confident that it is within the capacity of government to ensure that there are the funds that are required for what will need to be done to support these communities.

                 Minister, in the committee hearing we were told that this particular funding would come out of a contingency fund. I have a long history of not understanding contingency funds; I have had them explained to me a number of times. But in terms of the process, I am interested in the last letter from Minister Tudge, which arrived yesterday, I believe. It listed the number of services that would be enhanced by the $1 million payment. It also listed the number of services that were already in place. We were told there was a mapping exercise within the community, working with the community to see what services would be needed. I am very keen to know whether that is going to be the ongoing process, should there be other trial placements, and whether there would be any attempt to say that, because $1 million was appropriate to a trial in Ceduna, there could not be greater or lesser amounts in other trial sites, should such trials happen. What I want to find out is whether the process that we have seen in Minister Tudge's letter, which is working with the community to do a gap analysis and then looking at what other services there could be, would be the model and whether there would be any link between the amount of funding that has been given to this trial and the other trials having to have a similar amount of funding. It would be a similar model, but with no linkage to the amount of funding?

                  It will very much be a co-design process, and the amount of money will be that which is agreed with the community as part of that process. That experience in Ceduna will be an input, no doubt, into those discussions with the community but it will not be the determinative contribution or input to those discussions.

                    There is no formal budget or allocation as such. The amount will be that which is negotiated and determined with local communities. I have no doubt at all that those funds are available. The funds that will be required are available in the relevant portfolios.

                     Does that mean that services that should be available to other towns that would be paid for from the money that pays for these types of supports will not be available to other communities that require them? What happens if other communities put up their hands and say, 'Hey, we need a detox centre, we need a rehab centre, we need these wraparound services'? Does that mean that the trial sites will be prioritised and they will not get those things? How will that decision making occur? Secondly—this relates to evaluation, and I will go to evaluation later, but it does relate to budgets too—the evaluation will need to compare this approach, because it is a trial supposedly, to a centre that does not have the debit card. Will similar services be provided to another regional centre that does not have the debit card, to differentiate the debit card process and effect from the sorts of wraparound services that we all know are needed—in other words, comparing like with like? At the moment what you will be doing is looking at the trial and comparing it with the provision of the debit card and the services, whereas it is a lot of our contention that if you provide some of these early intervention services, rehab services, detox services and wraparound services it will in fact help tremendously to address issues around substance abuse and the sorts of things you say you are aiming for in this trial. That is a series of quite large questions. I appreciate that. Will other towns get this? Will you be specifically investing in these sorts of services in another town in order to be able to carry out a proper trial?

                      In what we have before us and in the correspondence which has gone from Assistant Minister Tudge to Ms Macklin and is also available for other colleagues, we are talking specifically about the support arrangements for these trials. I do not think anyone should think support arrangements for these trials would be to the detriment of any other community in the nation. If there are propositions that are put to government for support in other communities then they will be considered through the usual government processes. So I do not think anyone should see what is proposed here as being at the expense of other communities. There will be an evaluation of these trial sites. The community will be heavily involved in that evaluation process, and if there are other inputs that communities or colleagues in this place think should be looked at in that evaluation process then I am certain that Assistant Minister Tudge would be only too happy to sit down and talk to colleagues to explore these matters.

                        IAS
                       </a>
                       process—and we have a Senate inquiry into this—that applications that were made for these sorts of joined-up wraparound services we are talking about now did not get funded, and there were some in the Kimberley that did not get funded. So, I think a lot of the communities that put in applications through the last round of IAS funding will be (a) fascinated by this debate and (b) coming back to government to ask, 'Can we now have access to these services, given that other communities now seem to be able to get these services?'
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       My question there is: will the government now be willing to take applications from other communities for these sorts of services? It is a straightforward question: are you opening this process now to applications from other communities who want similar sorts of services for which you have now come up with funding all of a sudden? It is not that I think it is a bad idea to give them services. Will other communities now be able to put up their hand and say, 'We want some funding the same as Ceduna is getting'?

                          I might just take Senator Siewert through the advice that has been given to me on the evaluation process. It is expected that the evaluation will involve comprehensive analysis of multiple datasets from both qualitative and quantitative sources. The government is working closely with the Ceduna District Council and the

                          government and will do so with local and state governments in other trial sites to build a comprehensive community baseline dataset before the trial commences early next year. This is critical for measuring community-level change during the trial. The

                          has specifically committed to cooperating with state based data. This data may include state and territory collections, such as alcohol related hospitalisations, emergency department presentations and child protection data; Commonwealth collections, such as Centrelink administrative data related to drug and alcohol dependence, homelessness and housing, employment, recent trauma and domestic violence; local services data, including admissions to drug and alcohol services, mental health services, homelessness services and Aboriginal health services; and local merchant data, such as demand for alcohol and gambling products.

                         <p>
                          The government is working hand in hand with the Ceduna Community Heads Working Group, which will perform an important role in monitoring the trial and providing advice to government in relation to any unintended consequences or findings whilst the trial is on foot. In terms of the evaluation framework, the cashless debit card evaluation will have three components. The first will be the community change evaluation. An independent organisation will conduct interviews with trial participants and a wide cross-section of the community to explore the impact of the trial on levels of community harm, community functioning, alcohol consumption and rates of gambling, among other key issues relating to community safety. Second is the data monitoring project, where the government, in consultation with local and state governments, will collect data to monitor the effect of the trial in making communities safer on alcohol consumption and its wider negative effects in the community. A specialist with expertise in statistical methods will analyse the changes in these datasets during the trial. Thirdly, specialised product analysis. Recognising the debit card is a new innovation the government will engage a specialist to monitor and analyse the effectiveness of the card during the trial, and the evaluation will be made public.

                           Thank you for that additional information. There was some of that in the exchange of letters with the opposition. Thank you for outlining the additional data sets.

                           With all due respect, I appreciate the information but you did not actually answer my question, which was: will there be the ability to compare like with like? What you are doing is putting in place the debit card process and you are pouring in $1 million worth of additional services. I will repeat again that I think the additional services are really important, so I am not saying—and I do not want anyone for one second to say that I am saying—that those services are not important, because they are. But you have the debit card and the additional services. How are you going to differentiate the impact of the debit card from the additional services? In other words, you need another, similar community to be able to compare it. If you put in $1 million worth of services to a similar community, given the evidence base that we have seen before you are going to see a damn sight better response in that community than if those services were not there. So how are you going to differentiate the impact of the services and of the debit card?

                            You are right, Senator Siewert. I guess there are two broad elements to an evaluation. One is comparing the circumstances in the given community, looking at what the baseline was and how things have improved or otherwise. The other is comparing a trial site to a similar community, and that will be part of the trial. There are other communities that would be receiving some equivalent forms of community support and that is what the evaluation will look at.

                             I have a couple of questions around the evaluation. Has the government considered running the evaluation in a culturally appropriate way and, if so, what are those considerations? Secondly, what direct involvement—if any—will Aboriginal people who are part of organisations which are participating in the trial have in the trial? Sorry, I meant in the evaluation.

                              The whole approach—and Ceduna is a great worked example—has been to work up the design of the trial and also the evaluation in consultation with the community, and how organisations which may be involved in the trial can have input. The Ceduna Community Heads Working Group is such a mechanism. In terms of being culturally appropriate, the local community has been involved and will continue to be involved in every step of the way.

                                That precise input is to be determined. Obviously, we are open to that and we want that. Again, I emphasise that at every step this has been done in a collaborative way, recognising that the trial can only succeed with strong community support—and not just strong community support but also strong community involvement.

                                 Thank you. I do not want to press the point, but there is a difference between collaboration and cultural appropriateness. I am really trying to get to whether the evaluation will be done in a culturally appropriate way. If so, what is that? I do not think it is acceptable to say to me, 'Trust the government. We'll do it in a way that is.' Well—I have not heard the minister say it will be done in a culturally appropriate way, but just saying that it will be done 'collaboratively' is not saying that it will be done in a 'culturally appropriate' way. They are—or they can be—entirely different concepts. I asked about cultural appropriateness.

                                   Minister, following up on Senator Lines's questions, it would not seem to me to be too difficult for the government to commit to saying that the contract for the evaluation process—and we have already had the letter from Minister Tudge saying that it is a very important part of the process—could include culturally appropriate methodology.

Presumably, in putting the card in place, school attendance is one of the outcomes you are looking at, so where is that data currently being collected and how will you determine a baseline?

                                           Given that the concept of a trial in Ceduna has been agreed to, I do not understand the words, 'It is under consideration.' Are a range of determinants being considered, and will you come up with three or four? If we are withholding people's income, it seems to me that getting children to school should be one of the measures. How do we get confidence that it will be one of the measures, or is that still to be determined by the community? What is happening?

                                            Let me put it this way: all of us want kids to go to school; all of us want to take the availability of any information that we have as to which programs and which government arrangements demonstrate an improvement in kids getting to school. We know that the federal government has a strong interest in this area more broadly as well. We have the broad outlines of the evaluation, but these things are not absolutely set in stone. If there are additional things which the evaluation should look at which the community think need a stronger focus, then obviously that is something the government can look at.

                                                       It is not appropriate for somebody to have to go into a Centrelink office and speak to someone, with a glass panel between them, and present some evidence that they want to reduce the percentage on their card. Whilst it is a local level thing, for me it is a very important issue. We have to have confidence in this trial. If there are four or five people on a panel, it is intimidating to have to sit before them and outline your most basic need. That in and of itself does not seem to me to be appropriate.

                                                       Is it going to be a collaborative arrangement where an authorised officer works with that person? To have to front a panel and present some evidence to show that you should be entitled to a smaller percentage on your card is almost like begging. I appreciate that it is at the local level, but I think it is something that we have to get right; otherwise it just smacks of the appalling history we have, particularly in Western Australia, between the interface with white Australians and

                                                        I really do not think we want to be in the business of setting up straw people and knocking them down. I do not think we as government should dictate the way it should be. I do not think the senator opposite should dictate it. But, if she happens to think that she knows what would be the ideal arrangements, she is perfectly at liberty to share those with the local community. If she wants to do that, she should feel free to.

                                                        I will outline the situation with community bodies in a little more detail. The bill allows the local community body to support participants by varying the amount that is placed on the card down to a minimum of 50 per cent in response to demonstrated socially responsible behaviour or back up to the original amount if this behaviour is not maintained. It would also recommend support services, such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation or financial capability support. The local community body would not have the power to determine who would participate in a trial and it would be voluntary for a participant to appear before it. There is no compulsion here; it is voluntary. The local community body would be made up of local leaders who can represent the community and who have appropriate skills and standing in the community. The government is holding ongoing consultations with community leaders to determine the appropriate make-up of the body. That is what this is about. It is about consultation. It is far too early to be setting up straw men and knocking them down, Senator.

                                                       <p>
                                                        The local community body would make decisions to reduce an individual's restricted percentage based on agreed criteria, which may include evidence of meeting community norms, including meeting participation requirements and children attending school, and evidence that there is no misuse of drugs or alcohol or involvement in problem gambling. References from community members could be presented to support the individual's request. That is the schema, and we as a government are not dictating the way that people operate on the ground.

                                                         This goes to the heart of one of the failures of this process. This community body is a thought bubble. I do not know how many people currently in this Senate and debating this right now have lived in a small town. I have. I lived in a small town for quite a long time, where we all knew each other. Ceduna and the other towns we are talking about are probably slightly bigger than the town I lived in, but I would hazard a guess that a hell of a lot of people in Ceduna know each other.

                                                         Why we are questioning this is that it is obvious that the government has not thought this through. The minister is saying, 'We don't want to dictate every detail,' but that is because the government has not thought through what this means. So if I am on a carer payment, even though I do not have any substance abuse issues or gambling issues, I will be subjected to this and I will only get access to 50 per cent of the cash. So I have to front up to a community body of people I know, in a small community, and start talking about my personal financial arrangements. I am a carer providing care to one of my loved ones, and I have to go through this demeaning process—because that is what it is—with people I live down the street from or people I meet in the shopping centre or down at the shops. That is what we are talking about. That is what the government is setting up.

How are you going to ensure that people are able to go through this process without feeling demeaned and without feeling like that they have to go begging to a community body to get more access to cash? How can you assure this chamber that people will not be put off going to this body because of the very issues that I have just outlined?

No-one has to. Again I say that the card can buy anything except alcohol and gambling, and there will still be the 20 per cent that is available for the individual in cash.

People have talked about the loss of dignity and feeling demeaned because they cannot access cash if they need to. There are a whole lot of reasons that people may need to access cash. People have talked to me about wanting to be able to access more cash for various reasons. One of those is to be able to go to markets. I have not been to a fresh food market where too many operators have an

They do not want to explain their financial difficulties, how they happen to do their shopping or if they want to travel and need more access to cash, for example. The National Welfare Rights Network has outlined their case with examples of having to travel and needing cash or having to have a large amount of cash to contribute to a joint present for somebody.

In terms of the community body, you talk in the letter—and if I just refer to the letter, I presume everyone knows what I mean—about an appropriate review process of the community body decisions.

In the case of someone losing a card, you said, I think, that there will be a phone number. Given that I think everybody has lost a card from time to time, we all know how difficult it is to replace a card. One, what will the replacement procedure be; and, two, how will people get on in the interim?

I have asked you legitimate questions and, yes, I am concerned about the rollout of this card on the ground. I am absolutely entitled to not only ask the question but receive an appropriate answer. It is a real-life experience that somebody could well lose their card on a Saturday or Sunday and, despite the Prime Minister saying that we live in a seven-day economy, I do not agree with him. I am asking a legitimate question about how the replacement will occur. I appreciate that you have told me that it will not take weeks but, for example, if you get the trial up in Kununurra and you have to wait for some 'okay' from Canberra or Perth, that can take weeks. I am asking a legitimate question in a reasonable way about what happens when a card is lost on the weekend. I want to know what access there is for people to get food for their family or whatever else it is that they need. That is a reasonable question and I think the government really should have thought through the answer to that question.

We will make sure that in consultation with the community there are arrangements that satisfy the community. Why you would think that we would do anything other than seek to put in place arrangements through consultation with the community that satisfy the community I am not too sure. Given your interest in these particular aspects, I am sure that the minister would be very happy to provide a briefing for you that goes into the detail of what will happen from the moment someone losses a card to when they get their replacement card.

I was not suggesting for one moment that the government would deliberately withhold moneys, but we all know what happens when bureaucracy comes into play. The reality is that agencies that deal with cards, such as Centrelink and so on, are not open on Saturday and Sunday. What is the contingency? If somebody has lost their card, do they have to have documents that prove that they are who they say they are to get a replacement? And how do they get access to food on a Sunday morning? It is a legitimate question, and quite frankly the government should have a proper answer to that.

It has been a long, long time since I have lost a card, but it did not take my bank two weeks to get a replacement card to me. The advice I have is that the longest period would be until the next business day, but these are things that can be worked through with the community. These are things that can be worked through in the trial. Let me emphasise: this is our trial. This is a trial that we are embarking on here. There are still some details to be worked through with the community. Again, I am not going to make a declaratory and definitive statement on matters that I think are best worked through to finality with the local community to determine what will meet the needs of the individuals who are participants in this trial in the community.

I appreciate that it is a trial, but it is a trial that affects people's lives. It affects their ability to get food for their families, it affects their ability to manage their working day, if they are working, and it affects the way they operate. If I lose my card on a Friday I do not get one until Monday. What will the arrangements be in the interim? I also ask, because obviously you do have more information than you have been giving me: what is the documentary proof I have to front up with to get a replacement card?

I have had personal experience of this, having had my credit card stolen in a regional centre. It actually took more than two weeks to replace it. I alluded to this point in my contribution to the second reading debate last night.

It is not just about having a stock in Ceduna. I could have gone to Melbourne. I could have gone to Perth. How do I do that? Is everyone going to have a stock? Whichever financial institution is going to do this—and we will get to that in a minute—how can they guarantee that those stocks are going to be there? And how do I get access to cash in the meantime? I was able to access cash when my card was stolen, because I do not have a limit imposed on how much of my salary I can spend in cash. They do, so they will be able to get only a certain amount of cash. How do they get by when they are away, let alone in Ceduna, without being able to access cash before they get their card in those remote centres? And can you guarantee that the same deal that you do for Ceduna will apply everywhere else in Australia?

People have always lost their wallets, lost their purses, lost those things that are within them. It is always inconvenient when you lose your wallet or your purse and the things that are within it. There is always a period of time that it takes to replace that which is lost which was within your wallet or your purse. This is not a concept which has been created by the introduction of the concept of this card. Yes, I recognise that when people lose things it is inconvenient. What we will do is make sure that people can get a replacement card in the quickest possible period of time.

Particularly if I am travelling, for example, I am likely to have spent that, or I will go through it very quickly. So, sorry, the 20 per cent answer does not cut it, because I need access to more cash than that 20 per cent. It is a relatively small amount of money. People that are living on income support are living on small amounts of money and just managing to make ends meet.

I got my whole wallet stolen. I could go into my bank, prove who I was through answering a series of questions and get enough cash to take me through at least till I got back home and for a few days after that. I was away. I could access enough cash to do that. I have a limit, just to stop people being able to go in and use my cards to steal my cash. There is a limit there, but it is quite a high limit, as probably most of us have, for the amount of cash per day. But I could get that money because I do not have a limit on how much money I can take out of the bank. A person on Newstart could do the same thing as me—go and prove who they were through answering a series of questions so that they could take money out. I think I actually took out $500 so that I had enough cash, because I knew I was not going to be able to buy things electronically. That is what a person in the same situation as me would want to do—take out enough cash so that they could access things before they got their card back. In this case, they cannot do that. They may have already used the 20 per cent that they can access for the two weeks of the pay cycle. Even if they have a little bit of that left, they may not have enough left, potentially, because there is a limited amount of cash they can get. So, yes, they can access the cash, but only a tiny amount. So what do they do then for the rest of the time, when they cannot access any more cash because they do not have the card? This is not a made-up scenario. It is a real-life scenario. That is why we are asking, because this is what it means to people on the ground when they are trying to get through this process. They will be surviving trying to use the card. You have got to think of what it means day to day, and this is a really live situation. Lots of people in the community travel quite long distances, but, even if they do not, it also happens if they are still in town and it is not the travelling scenario that I am outlining.

If someone is away from home for an extended period, there could be arrangements for the replacement card to be sent to that Centrelink office, I guess in a similar fashion as to what might happen with a bank. But let me indicate again: where there are particular issues that the community identify as issues, then they can certainly be looked at.

I will have my bank account where I have my 20 per cent that I can access as cash. I will not have a choice about which provider I use—we will come to the issue of the financial institution in a minute. I am forced to have this card and a separate bank account, so I am going to be paying two sets of costs?

I think it is appropriate for us to know the range in dollar terms of what people will be paying.

As you know, the Senate is doing a separate inquiry into these matters at the moment to do with credit cards, which kind of relates to this. The consistency seems to be that, if you are using a card at an institution other than the institution that has issued that card, there is a fee for withdrawal of money, as there is also a fee for checking your balances. That is across every card, and that is across every bank.
                                                                                                                  </p>

But, if I am in a rural or regional area or a remote Indigenous community, there are reports of up to $3.70 being charged for that same function. Some would argue that this is a discrepancy relating to a lack of competition in these more rural and regional kinds of areas.

The question would be: have the practicalities of the fees associated and what the fees will do been looked at and modelled, and has there been any discussion with the financial institutions for these trials on how we can minimise that?

In terms of checking people's balances on the debit card, people can do that without cost.

The cash component, the 20 per cent, would go into your bank account or whatever the mechanism is that you specify. There are no fees associated with the debit card account.

As I said earlier, there is work going on, particularly in the trial regions, to try to ensure that merchants have that as low as possible.

Have you set aside an amount that you think this is going to cost? Surely you have done that. When these things are done, you usually do estimates. There will be estimates next week so we will be traversing this again, I suspect, if we cannot resolve this now. What have you budgeted for the cost of that?

We were talking about the evaluation so I want to go back to the evaluation and to the community body. We went off onto fees. I heard what you said earlier around still working out with the community body and you wanted to negotiate with the community on what processes would be used et cetera. I am wondering have you set a minimum set of requirements? There are still areas of negotiation but surely you have got some view on what would be the minimum set of standards or minimum criteria to negotiate around?

If the community comes up with something and it does not meet the standards or the view, do you say 'no'? This, as I said earlier, is a pretty significant issue. They have a lot of responsibilities on their shoulders. In other committees I have been involved with, on assessments, we were usually given some guidance at least as to what were the minimum expectations, so I would have thought that was a fairly fair thing to do. We are talking about people's access to income support here; it is not an arbitrary thing. There are fairly set rules around it from the government and from others, so surely you would have some minimum level of requirement that you would expect from a community body? If you do not, what would you do if they came up with a scenario that in fact you did not think was acceptable?

Firstly, people do not just stay in Ceduna; people travel. So what happens then? That occurs all around Australia. So what do you do when they travel outside Ceduna? We have been focusing on Ceduna because we know that the memorandum is already signed, but is the same level of negotiation going on in East Kimberley and in any other proposed trial location?

I want to clarify that in terms of the kinds of questions that people have been asking today around how trials will operate. What kind of detail and exchange of information process is going to occur before disallowable instruments are developed and brought to the chamber?

We have yet, now, to go down the process of saying Ceduna or other places where trials will exist. Can you give us any indication of what the interaction is going to be with us—with the parliament and with the Senate—about, even now, how the trial in Ceduna will actually progress, in particular for the disallowable instrument? Should you have other locations in mind, what will be the degree of detail that will come forward to explain to us how they will operate?

I am sure that the assistant minister will be happy to put in place briefing arrangements for colleagues in this place so that they can feel satisfied that they have full knowledge and appreciation of how arrangements will operate and what will be contained within the legislative instruments.

How is it determined when fraud might be happening or there is an attempt to get around some of these things? I think that Senator Xenophon, when he gets back, might want to traverse this as well. I know he used an example last night that he called 'fluffy pillows', I think, which makes it sound very innocuous when in fact it is an online gambling mob.

One is: banks have standard processes and algorithms that help them determine some of these sorts of things that put flags up. The other part of the answer is that the exact mechanism—or things that might set flags off—is probably not something that would be appropriate to canvass publicly lest it might assist people who may be attempting to do the wrong thing.

Let us be really clear about that. This is what we are trialling here. This is why we are asking.

I may be in a cafe for a meal and I may have purchased a glass of wine or a beer. I may be out for a birthday celebration. How is it envisaged that that will actually operate? This is supposed to be non-discriminatory. It is not supposed to be demeaning and it is not supposed to be identifying people, but I could be there at the till, potentially at a restaurant which cannot split bills—most restaurants now do not split bills—how would it then operate with the alcohol component and the meals component?

So there is one terminal where you might pay for your food and another where you might pay for your alcohol through the bar. There are mechanisms and means for organisations that sell a range of products, some of which are appropriate and allowed under the debit card trial and some of which are not.

This is a scenario that has been brought up with me: what if I were travelling and going to eat a meal and I have not negotiated with them? I am sorry, but that is just not an answer.

Where do I stand—in a separate queue?' et cetera.

So I could do it outside, if I were travelling outside, but I could not do it in Ceduna. Is it going to be the same in each of the trial sites or are you going to have a different set of arrangements in each of the trial sites?

Coming back to your previous answer: I would not in fact be able to attempt to use my card to buy a meal, depending on what is negotiated in Ceduna at the moment. So if you negotiate that it is not going to include restaurants that serve alcohol I could not go in there and I would not be able even to use the card—even to use it to purchase a meal.

How do I organise it? This is what people are bringing up with me. I have to flag that I am on income support, that I have a different card and that I have to pay for my alcohol out of my limited amount of 20 per cent cash.

This is not just a normal card that you can use anywhere, with no-one knowing that you are on income support and without you being signalled as somebody who is caught up in the trial. In fact in these stores in these particular situations in Ceduna you will be signalled, because you have to flag a different arrangement.

It would not just be people on the debit card who would need to split their bill. Everyone would be required to split their bill, regardless of whether or not they are on the debit card.

I wonder whether the people in Ceduna who are not on income support know that, from now on, they will have to pay separately for their alcohol. Is that what we are saying? If that is what I just heard, that is exactly what is happening. Have you canvassed the whole of Ceduna to find out whether they know that that is what they are going to be doing, if in fact that is what you mean?

The debit card will work only on the food-only terminal. Someone who had a debit card but was wanting to pay for alcohol with cash or with another card linked to their own account would do so on the same terminal as everyone else. There would be a terminal that all alcohol purchases would go through and, if someone were using the debit card for food, that would go through the debit card terminal—and anyone else could use that terminal as well.

So my original question and scenario-painting were in fact correct. Anyone else can use that terminal—yes, they can if they are not buying alcohol. So there are still two separate terminals. I am in there, I have had my meal and I am coming out. I will come back to the sign issue in a moment. But it is clear that I will have to use two different terminals if I have had a drink with my lunch or dinner. That is correct, is it not?

Therefore, because I need to save my cash to buy other things, I am probably going to want to put that on the debit card. So, yes, you can get out of it by saying that you could use your cash, but the fact is that that will get used up pretty quickly. Is that not the point? Before I walk into the restaurant, is there a process whereby people will know where they can and cannot use these cards? I can imagine this is going to be complicated. There will need to be splitting of bills. Restaurants do not do splitting of bills really well. Will a sign be up so that I am not embarrassed when I am confronted with this process?

That knowledge should guide people, and will guide people, as to what particular card they use to pay for which particular transactions. So someone going into a place that serves alcohol would know that they would not be able to use their debit card to purchase alcohol. I think the arrangements on the ground in individual stores are probably more straightforward because people essentially self-select on the basis of what they can and cannot purchase on the basis of whether or not they are a holder of a debit card.

So let's be clear here: the only area outside that you will be able to do it is where it is a licensed restaurant? Does that apply to a roadhouse, because they are not licensed restaurants? So is the difference then that it is just in Ceduna, or whatever the trial site is, where the actual licensed restaurants are going to be caught up in this?

At this stage, I think the debate has been very good. I have only a few questions, and I do apologise in advance if they have already been asked. I have not had a chance to listen to every single bit of the debate. You will have to forgive the cynic in me, but I do have concerns that the trial is being targeted at low-socioeconomic groups to guarantee success of the trial and to make it easier to justify expansion into the future. In the event that this trial is successful for this particular socioeconomic group, would the data be used, and how would it be used, to predict success for potential future implementation of this type of policy to socioeconomic groups that do not match the trial group?

The trial site in Ceduna has been chosen because of the very high indicators of hospitalisation and other abuses—and I am just flicking through my notes to give you some of the statistics, specifically, in relation to Ceduna.

The local sobering-up facility had 4,667 admissions that same year from a regional population of 4,425. I will just share with you a quote I sighted a little earlier from the Ceduna Community Heads Group, a key legislative group in Ceduna who have endorsed the concept of the trial. They said:

It has been a true collaboration to ensure that we can give our mob and our Communities every chance to create real and genuine change in their lives.

Part of the rationale for having a defined component of someone's payment that can only be accessed through the card is to limit the amount of money that could be used on illicit drugs, gambling or alcohol.

I emphasise: it is a trial. There will be evaluation, and we do want to learn from the trial.

I understand the purpose of the trial, and the reason it is being debated now is to attempt to help with certain issues that you just mentioned. Considering this is a low-socioeconomic area with these issues, will the data be used to predict success into the future and to roll out the policy into the broader community?

It is not necessarily tied to socioeconomics, because there can be some low-socioeconomic areas where you do not have these kinds of statistics. It is not that a low-socioeconomic area has been chosen as such; it is the rates of harm that are present that has determined the one community at this stage that the trail is aimed at. It is not something that seeks to characterise low-socioeconomic communities. It is something that recognises that there are some communities that have a higher incidence of harm, and we are seeing if, through this mechanism, we can reduce that. I am advised that the intention was always to target the areas, if you like, of greatest need with some of these really appalling statistics.

Does it capture other people who are currently doing the right thing? Is the trial going to pick up people who are not repeat offenders in hospitalisations or sobering-up programs?

There will be local bodies that people can put that to. You are right: this will apply to anyone on a working-age payment.

We take the evaluation seriously. We will want to have the trial, look at the evaluation, see if it is a success and, if it is, then at that point we would make a determination as to whether to seek to expand it to other communities. Our approach with this trial, and possibly with another two, is to work with local communities, to be consultative and to see if there is a willingness as there is in Ceduna. In Ceduna there is a really, really strong desire for this to be in place, but we take the evaluation seriously and I would not want to prejudge that evaluation or any decisions that we might take after that.

I suppose I am trying to seek some kind of commitment that these trials would not supply data that would then encourage policy to put this type of trial into legislation which goes far beyond communities that would even ask for it.

If the government was wanting to do something in addition to that it could only be with the approval of this chamber. We would have to introduce fresh legislation.

The first relates to the location of the trial. I have had some very good and productive discussions with Assistant Minister Tudge in relation to this—and I want to express my gratitude to the assistant minister and to his office for their level of cooperation and goodwill.

I know that Assistant Minister Tudge has made it very clear that there has been extensive consultation with a number of key stakeholders. The assistant minister has indicated to me that there will be a public meeting in Ceduna that will go for two to three hours—I think that the minister's adviser is helpfully nodding, and hopefully that nod can be translated through the minister into

Before any regulations are tabled, before any final decision is made, can the minister indicate that there will be a public meeting in Ceduna that will allow a robust exchange of views with the local community, and that the public meeting will involve the assistant minister?

I am grateful for that, and I think that it is going to be very important. I am sure that it will be a feisty, robust meeting. It is important in a democracy for those concerns to be raised. I will raise some of the concerns that were put to me in the community gathering that I went to at the Ceduna community hotel.

It is an issue that I have discussed with my colleagues Senator Moore and Senator Siewert. It relates to the regulations for the trial. The concern that I have had is that, at the moment, in terms of subordinate legislation, there are 15 sitting days to disallow a regulation, so, if a problem is apparent, if there is a serious problem with the trial—and I hope that will not be the case; I want to make that clear—we have only got 15 sitting days to deal with that. I was going to move an amendment to extend that 15 days to 30 days, but that would involve some technical difficulties. I would be grateful if the government could indicate and give a firm undertaking that any regulations would be established for a period of six months only, with the intent that there be a further period of six months, effectively giving the Senate an opportunity to consider a disallowance of those regulations on two occasions, with 15 sitting days each time. I think that would give us a greater level of scrutiny, in a sense, and scrutiny with teeth, in respect of this. Again, I make it clear that I want this to work, as does the government, but I think it is important that we have that additional level of safety and scrutiny for the communities involved.

However, if we are going to do that, is there a commitment that information that is collected as part of the monitoring process will be made available so that, when we are then considering the next regulatory process, we will have access to that information? Otherwise it is a moot point, because, if we do not have access to information, we will not be able to make a decision about whether we support the next regulatory instrument.

I guess I look at it from a slightly different perspective. By having two legislative instruments, by having two periods of six months, if the government is not being transparent in the process—and I would shocked if it were not, and I say that with a straight face, because I think it is in the government's interest for there to be transparency in the process. I genuinely believe that. I know some more cynical in the chamber might not have that view, but the fact is: if there is not, then that itself could be a factor for the disallowance. I think the government would know that, in order to ensure that the regulation not be disallowed in the second six-month period, there would need to be a level of transparency and accountability in the process. So I think that itself would act to be useful.

This person had never been on welfare for 40 years. They had fallen on hard times and needed welfare, needed that support. They had paid their taxes for 40 years or so and they felt a level of stigma in having such a card and that they would have to go to a panel to get approval for some pre-existing payments they had to make. Perhaps we could address that when we get back to this bill.
