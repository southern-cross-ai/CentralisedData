           Ten years ago the Australian government acknowledged the abuse and neglect experienced by forgotten Australians and child migrants placed in institutional or out-of-home care in the last century. This apology recognised, on behalf of all Australians, a truth that had previously been denied. Many forgotten Australians and former child migrants experienced appalling abuse and neglect—sickeningly, most often at the hands of the very people who were responsible for their care. Today, on behalf of the government, we say sorry once again. I reiterate the words of the Prime Minister: 'We believe you.' The government reaffirm our commitment to continue to work closely with state and territory governments as well as with forgotten Australians and former child migrants to deliver ongoing assistance to those who seek it.
