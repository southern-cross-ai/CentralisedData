        () (): This week we've learned that once again the Liberal-National parties are going to turn their backs on manufacturing in this country. At the last election, Labor was very clear about our commitment: we want to bring manufacturing home, and we will bring manufacturing back to regional Queensland. The National Reconstruction Fund will invest $15 billion in rebuilding Australia's manufacturing industry. It will provide loans, equity investment and guarantees for modern manufacturing, clean energy, defence and medical projects and technologies. It has been carefully designed as a targeted, strategic investment to make sure that we secure our long-term security and prosperity.

They have form in turning their backs on manufacturing, and I'm yet to understand their motives for doing this. What I'm yet to figure out is exactly why they have turned their backs on Aussie workers and Australian manufacturing once again. Perhaps they can help me out? Are they voting against the legislation because they're embarrassed by the legacy they left for Australian manufacturing? Do they not want to admit that they oversaw the hollowing out of the manufacturing industry that Australians were once proud of? Is it not the

        's cup of tea to deliver this important investment because there will be investment in renewables, which I know some of the people opposite could get a little bit upset about? Did they decide against supporting manufacturing because there will actually be a return on investment and good, secure jobs for regional Queenslanders?
