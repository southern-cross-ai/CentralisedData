        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. Yesterday, the minister denied in the Senate that the government was seeking to privatise
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACAT" rel="nofollow">
         ACAT
        </a>
        services. On 15 January, Minister Colbeck told
        <i>
         The Sydney Morning Heral
        </i>
        d that the ACAT tender process would be open to existing assessment organisations, including government agencies and—I quote—'to the private sector'. How does the minister reconcile these two statements?

         As I indicated to the chamber yesterday, the government currently doesn't procure directly any assessment service in the aged-care sector. It subcontracts to state governments for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACAT" rel="nofollow">
          ACAT
         </a>
         services, and it contracts to other providers—I think about 17 other providers—for the provision of regional assessment services. What the government has said it intends to do is to create a single assessment workforce. That is exactly what we intend to do. I have never conceded that the government's intention is to privatise, as the opposition continue to claim, because that has never been our intention.

           Senator Wong obviously didn't hear what I just said. The private sector actually already provides some of those services right now. We don't procure any services directly ourselves. I have also said, as a part of this process, that we need to bring the workforce together as one. That is an objective of the government, and it was also a recommendation of the Tune review to bring together a single workforce. That is the government's determination. That is what we intend to do.
          </p>
          <p>
           We need to reform the way that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACAT" rel="nofollow">
            ACAT

           services and

           </a>
           are delivered, because there are currently duplications in the system and there are too many waiting for too long for a state based aged-care assessment. In fact, as at 31 December last year, 591 people had waited for over 75 days for a state based ACAT assessment.

              Senator Hanson was right when she yesterday that the government had no intention of privatising the aged-care assessment process. I've been saying that for a long time. The opposition can pass as many motions and make as many claims as they like, but it's not going to change the fact that the government has no intention, and never has had any intention, of privatising the

                My point of order is direct relevance. I have generously allowed the minister nearly half his time to answer the question. The question was very specific. It was not for the minister to elaborate on Senator Hanson's words but rather to clarify if that means that the tender will no longer be open to private sector organisations, as he previously said it would be.

                              On the point of order, I am not going to rule on whether or not someone is answering a question, in the sense that that is in the eye of the beholder too often, and there is a chance to debate it after question time. The minister was being directly relevant by addressing the question. If it is not in a way that the person asking the question prefers, there is an opportunity after question time to debate that. Senator Colbeck to continue.

                               Again, for the benefit of those opposite, we will work cooperatively with the states and territories to ensure that senior Australians get the assessment services that they need in a timely way to support their entry into the aged care system.
