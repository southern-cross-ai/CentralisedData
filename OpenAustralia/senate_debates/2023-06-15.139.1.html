         The way the Albanese government deals with Indigeneity is with a three-part test, which has been widely accepted and hasn't changed. We apply the following common law criteria for the purposes of determining eligibility for

           Thank you, Senator Hanson. I think the minister is being relevant, and I will ask her to continue. But I will continue to listen very carefully. As you know, I can't direct the minister to answer, but I can draw her attention to the question if she is not being relevant. She is just a few seconds into the answer. I will listen carefully, and, if she is not being relevant, I will draw her attention to the question.

            descent, identifies as an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as such by the community in which they live or have previously lived. This is a widely accepted test by government agencies, First Nations organisations and community organisations. It is a commonsense approach. The way it works in law is well established.

              That was not an answer to my question. Considering the evidence that Indigenous identity fraud exists, and evidence has been brought to Minister Linda Burney's attention, what measures has the Albanese Labor government put in place to prevent, identify, investigate and prosecute Indigenous identity fraud?

               Well, I am not across what Senator Hanson alleges has been provided to Minister Burney, but the approach that we take is a positive approach around how to test eligibility for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                First Nations

                    Again, not answered. Considering the evidence that Indigenous fraud exists, which has been reported numerous times, and in courts, will the Labor senators support my motion to refer this vital matter to an inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee or any other committee? Are you prepared to actually address this problem that we have in Australia so that people who are actually of Aboriginal and Indigenous background can receive the benefits that many other Australians can't get?

                     (â€”) (): Firstly, the answer to the question is no, we will not support that. Secondly, we don't recognise identity fraud. Thirdly, I don't believe it is up to an individual in this place to decide who gets to be an Aboriginal person in this country.

                     people have lived here for over 65,000 years. We should all be really proud of that, of sharing the same country with the longest continuing civilisation in this country. And the Albanese government's priority, apart from ensuring adequate funding, resources and co-design processes for services to support First Nations Australians, is to ensure recognition is done through constitutional amendment, through a Voice to this nation's parliament. That is our priority. We look forward to every Australian having the opportunity to cast a vote on that later this year.
