        , my question is to my friend and colleague the Minister for Human Services, Senator Payne, representing the Minister for Trade and Investment. Can the minister outline the benefits emerging from the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement? How does this agreement complete a successful trifecta of trade agreements that will create new jobs and opportunities for Australians, particularly in

         I particularly want to thank Senator Sinodinos for that question as a fellow senator for

          New South Wales
         </a>
         , because in the state of New South Wales where half of the state's two-way goods trade is with our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
          FTA
         </a>
         trifecta countries, these are deals which were worth more than $53 billion last year alone. So the potential is absolutely extraordinary. Our trifecta of trade agreements is with the major economies of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asia" rel="nofollow">
          North Asia
         </a>
         . They are very powerful neighbours and they are going to help us diversify this economy—which it needs, after all the years those opposite had in government. In particular. our landmark free trade agreement with China is going to open up huge opportunities for Australian resources, for agriculture, for manufacturing, for service industries. It will create thousands upon thousands of jobs into the future. Just like the trade deals with Japan and Korea, which are already in operation, the benefits from ChAFTA to Australian businesses, Australian workers and Australian companies will flow immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact, if we implement ChAFTA this year, it will provide a double bonus effect of tariff cuts for our exporters—one round of tariff cuts this year and a second round of tariff cuts in January 2016. So how irresponsible is it to play games with these issues? How irresponsible is it to reject the advice of Labor figures like

         Chief Minister Andrew Barr? They have all thrown their support behind this deal. Why? Because they have the capacity to see the opportunities it will provide for business in their jurisdictions. They have the experience to know what it can mean for this country. They know why it took 10 years to negotiate this deal and why the delays from the other side are so unhelpful. We need to pass the deal now.

           I note Senator Cameron says breathlessly, 'It's an advertising campaign,' which was of course secretly hidden in the budget papers in May of this year—some $24 million at the time—to raise awareness and assist businesses to take advantage of the enormous opportunities which are going to be presented by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
            FTA
           </a>
           . We are rolling out a range of initiatives to promote the benefits of these agreements, to raise awareness and to encourage more businesses to export. It is not rocket science. Even Senator Cameron should be able to deal with it. It is about helping more businesses export, employ more Australians and promote this country internationally. All of those things—an innovative dashboard, FTA seminars across the country, enhanced helpdesk support, information kits and materials and other promotional activities to boost uptake—are going to encourage Australian business to do more work in this region, to engage more proactively with China and to create more business and more employment opportunities.

             I can do that, Senator Sinodinos. Last week in Parramatta in

              Andrew Robb
             </a>
             , addressed a very popular free trade agreement seminar on just this subject. We all know that Western Sydney is an absolutely vital part of our economy, with two million people and over 150,000 local businesses. For a company like

              FTA

             s, RBK is set for a triple bonus of benefits, with Korea's eight per cent tariff to be eliminated by 2018, Japan locking in duty-free access and China's 20 per cent tariff to be fully lifted within four years. That can only help improve RBK's competitive position. It makes it easier for them to grow, prosper and employ more Australians—more people in Western Sydney—which is exactly what these trade agreements are all about.
