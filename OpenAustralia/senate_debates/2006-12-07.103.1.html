        My question is to Senator Abetz, Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. Can the minister confirm that weeds cost the agriculture industry $4 billion annually and that weed control action cost the industry $1.1 billion last year? Is it also true that any farmer will tell you that weeds are one of their top two problems and that weed infestation will be even worse after the drought? In that context, is the minister aware that the cooperative research centre committee has refused to even interview the proponents of a new Invasive Plants CRC because of a government directive to not fund environmental research under this program? Why has the government taken such an anti-farmer stance by wiping its hands of investment in research aimed at tackling this massive problem for Australia’s farm sector?

         I thank Senator Stephens for her question. It is nice to see the Greens today, and now the Labor Party, finally recognising the problem of weeds to Australian agriculture and to our biodiversity.

                 As I was saying, the cost of weeds to our community is estimated by the experts to be about $4 billion per annum. It is a major problem. The cooperative research centre have done excellent work but, as with all cooperative research centres, they have to resubmit and go through a very rigorous evaluation process. Unfortunately, on this occasion they were not recommended for funding into the future. Having said that, the director of the weeds CRC, Dr Rachel McFadyen, was in my office this morning. We were discussing the way forward because, unlike those opposite who try to use weeds to make a cheap political point, some of us on this side have a genuine interest—and that is what I was exploring with the good doctor earlier this morning. A lot of good work has been done. We do not want to lose that research and that body of knowledge. So I am working, as best I am able, with those involved in the cooperative research centre to see what other avenues might be available.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Having said that, our Defeating the Weed Menace program of some $44.4 million remains in place. We are continuing to fight the menace of weeds not only for our farmers, because of the economic cost, but also because of the real environmental costs to our biodiversity. When the rains finally come again, as I am sure they will, the problem of weeds could well be substantially more serious than it is now because of the flooding that will undoubtedly occur and all the seeding that has taken place. We as a government recognise, and have recognised for a long time, the problem of weeds. That is why my colleague started the Defeating the Weed Menace program. We have committed $44.4 million to it.

                   Senator Brown continues with his incessant, inane interjections. I do not know why he continues to prove that he knows nothing about the topic. We as a government are committed to the Defeating the Weed Menace program. Possibly Senator Brown is interested in another form of weed, but we will not go there today.

                    , I rise on a point of order. You know that standing order 193(3) does not allow for innuendo to be used in this place. I ask that that be withdrawn.

                        I do so. We are in the Christmas spirit now so I am willing to do that for Senator Brown and wish him good cheer for the new year as well. In short, we as a government are concerned about the weeds menace and we are dealing with it.

                         , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his response. I am very pleased to hear that he met with the director of the CRC this morning. The minister referred to the Defeating the Weed Menace program. Since the failed application for the Invasive Plants CRC represented a request of $4 million a year from the Commonwealth and had already raised quite significant funds from other sources, will the minister undertake to further discuss the matter with the proponents of the application to see if funds can be found from other sources in his portfolio or from other portfolios?

                          As the honourable senator knows, I am sure, the funding of CRCs in fact falls within the province and portfolio responsibilities of my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training. I have made representations to her and, as I said, I met with Dr McFadyen this morning. In fact, just two evenings ago I had dinner with the National Weeds Advisory Group and discussed, amongst other things, these very issues. So we are on top of it; we have been for a long time. Something that we do not do is play cynical politics with these sorts of issues; we just get on with the job. I think one of the reasons why the Howard government has been returned is that people accept that we work on these issues with a genuine interest for the Australian people.
