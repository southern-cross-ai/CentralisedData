        My question today is to the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator Arbib. Can the minister advise the Senate on recent unemployment data released by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        ? In particular, can the minister inform the Senate about the results of the regional labour force figures released today? Given the strong growth in employment recorded last week, what do these regional unemployment figures tell us about jobs growth in Australia? Are there areas that are still at high risk from unemployment? How have the government strategies helped to promote job growth throughout Australia?

         On Tuesday this week, I reflected on the recent unemployment figures dropping to 5.2 per cent, which was fantastic news for Australian job seekers. It means that, over the year to May, 280,000 jobs were created in this country for Australians. This is critical when you compare it to what is happening overseas: unemployment up to 9.9 per cent in the United States; in Ireland, 13 per cent; in Spain, up to 19 per cent; and, in this country, unemployment continuing to drop to 5.2 per cent. Today also we have seen the release of the regional
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Force_Survey" rel="nofollow">
          Labour Force Survey
         </a>
         , and there is more good news, with unemployment falling in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>

          South Australia

         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         But there is more work to do. In some regions, like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Far North Queensland
         </a>
         , we have seen drops in unemployment, but in other areas, such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         , there have been difficulties. Long-term unemployment continues to grow, but very long-term unemployment has dropped by 1.4 per cent. This shows the need for the stimulus package, the infrastructure package and the 50,000 projects that are taking place right now around the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         The biggest risk to employment in this country is those sitting opposite. If we had listened to their advice and done nothing when the global financial crisis hit, this country would be in recession and 200,000 Australians would be out of work. And what is their latest plan? Their latest plan is to stop the schools infrastructure package. Thousands of workers would lose their jobs if we listened to

          Tony Abbott

         . Thousands of small businesses would go under.

             was the community hardest hit by the global recession. Today we have had some good news. While these figures are monthly and obviously we need to be tentative, the figures show that the unemployment rate has gone down in Far North Queensland from 10.4 per cent in April to 8.9 per cent in May—a drop of 1.5 per cent. As all senators know, a great deal of work has gone into this. I thank
