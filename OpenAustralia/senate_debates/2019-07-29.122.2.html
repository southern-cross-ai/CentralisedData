          This is an important motion that really goes to the heart of expert advice from frontline service providers in the family and domestic violence space; from our lead national researcher, Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety, ANROWS; and from Australian Women Against Violence Alliance, AWAVA, one of the lead womens' advocacy bodies. They are begging the government to not require couples counselling where there have been recorded incidents of domestic violence. Frontline services desperately need more funding. However, to allocate funding for mandatory or even optional, but forced, couples counselling in incidences of violence in a relationship where other services are struggling for funding is against the advice of these expert bodies. It's clear that we need trained experts to be providing services, not faith based organisations to be requiring couples counselling, which is what the government's criteria provide for.

             This motion is misleading. The government is funding an expansion of specialised family violence services primarily to provide additional services for children who witness or experience violence. Specialist family violence services do not force survivors to undergo counselling with perpetrators, and all funded services must be delivered in accordance with the National Outcome Standards for Perpetrator Interventions. The government believes it should provide a wide range of services to encourage women to come forward to access the support that is their right. The Morrison government has committed a record $328 million for prevention and frontline services under the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. We do not require couples counselling.

                is opposed to domestic violence, but I find this motion divisive. Section 3 says:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                … adequately fund frontline domestic violence and crisis housing services to ensure that all women seeking safety can access these services when and where they need them …
               </p>
               <p>
                Men are faced with domestic violence as well, and there is no shelter for men and their children who are facing domestic violence. I feel it's very selective and divisive. And section 4 says:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                … adequately fund the provision of safe and specific family violence support services for Aboriginal, culturally and linguistically diverse, and
