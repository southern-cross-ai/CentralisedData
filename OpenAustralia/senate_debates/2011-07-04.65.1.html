        My question without notice is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Is the minister aware that in its recent report,
        <i>
         The critical decade
        </i>
        , the Climate Commission identified:
       </p>
       <p>
        … eliminating harvesting of old-growth forests as perhaps the most important policy measure that can be taken to reduce emissions from land ecosystems.
       </p>
       <p>
        If so, does the minister agree and what is he doing about it?

         In the area of agricul­ture, what we have been doing as a government is, firstly, putting together a price on carbon; and, secondly, in this portfolio, working with the minister for climate change on the Carbon Farming Initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition is divided on this issue. Until recently, the opposition was describing the Gillard government's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFI" rel="nofollow">
          CFI
         </a>
         as the 'fastest and cheapest way for Australia to reduce its emissions'. The critical issue here is how we then progress the Carbon Farming Initiative. It will allow farmers to generate carbon credits and new earning opportunities through a range of activities, such as manure management, fertiliser management, reduced livestock emissions, soil carbon and reafforestation. This initiative will provide us with the opportunity to lead the world in the development of land based sector offsets.
        </p>
        <p>
         The carbon market will be supported through a number of initiatives, including the development of offset methodologies, because it is important to put those metho­dologies in place, on-farm demonstrations for biochar and the provision of $4 million for Landcare facilitators to educate farmers on the opportunities presented by the carbon market. So within this portfolio and with the minister for climate change we are pursuing a way to ensure that the land based sector—that is, the farmers and the producers across this area—can utilise the Carbon Farming Initiative to develop outcomes for farmers to ensure we can have long-term security around reafforestation, if that is additionally supported. Of course, Mr Garnaut argued that allowing offsets for carbon—

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister's answer, does he think there needs to be more done to stop the logging of old-growth forests? Particularly, can he inform the Senate whether he is aware of, or has been part of, any discussions with the Tasmanian govern­ment pertaining to an offer of a loan from the Tasmanian government to Aprin logging to purchase the Triabunna woodchip mill in order to keep it operating to woodchip native forests?

           I indicate that it is best that I take the second part of that question on notice. I have not spoken recently to the Tasmanian government specifically about the matter that you raise. It does seem to be part of the Tasmanian forestry principles agreement process; however, in the detail you have indicated, I am not aware whether the specific loan you speak of exists or not. In terms of the two matters, the government has consistently stated that the statement of principles is a community led process. The signatories to the statement of principles include the environment
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
            NGO
           </a>
           s. It is up to these signatories to come to an agreement. The government will consider its response in conjunction with the Tasmanian government.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I look forward to the minister coming back to me in relation to that woodchip mill. I want a particular under­taking that the Commonwealth government will not give any funding to Tasmania under any negotiated forest outcome until the full details of the involvement of

             I think it is worth while putting on the record that on 14 June 2011 Gunns announced on the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Stock_Exchange" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Stock Exchange
             </a>
             the sale of its Triabunna export woodchip facility. I understand that sale is to be to an entity established by the family owned logging and haulage company Aprin Pty Ltd. Gunns further announced that the sale was conditional on satisfactory progress in the implementation of the Tasmanian forest statement of principles. The Australian government has not been approached regarding the sale or operation of the Triabunna mill.

                Industry and government want to see an operating mill which will provide the best results for jobs in Tasmania. The issue of course is whether there is Commonwealth support. The gov­ern­ment is committed to this process, as outlined in the Prime Minister's statement of 7 December last year. We continue to support discussions—
