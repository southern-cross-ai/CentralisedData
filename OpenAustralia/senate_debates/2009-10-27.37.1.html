        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC

           They are demanding more confidential information be released from other participants in the tender process. They have gone to the extraordinary length of putting a blanket ban on dealing with any broadband or

The value of network assets is a subject of talks with Telstra and we have already indicated that we will not be discussing or giving a running commentary on these discussions. But, as I said, once again the gross hypocrisy of those opposite is on display in relation to this issue. Senator Minchin has expressed concerns about the release of the data, and we share those concerns. However, the effect of the motion being debated, which those opposite have championed in order to block
