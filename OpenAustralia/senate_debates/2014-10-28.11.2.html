        My question is to the Minister for Defence. I refer to evidence before the Senate committee from naval shipbuilding expert Dr John White. He said:

       </p>
       <p>
        Why is the government misleading the public by claiming there is not enough time to build Australia's new submarines in Adelaide without a capability gap when the experts are saying the opposite?

         That is a very good question. I have an enormous amount of respect for Dr White. Indeed, we used him to do a report into the mess that was left to us by the former Labor government with respect to frigates being several hundred million dollars over budget and several years late. The only real authority in Australia as to where we are at with submarines is inside the defence department. If the Labor Party had done its homework and read and studied what Admiral Moffitt, who was in charge of the program, has been saying for the last several years, it would know the timing is crystal clear. For six years, Labor had done nothing. Indeed, I said this on 8 May 2013. I said this in a number of statements. I said that if the two options left behind by Minister Smith, the son of Collins option and the bespoke Australian design, were real and not fantasies then we would accept the minister at his word. But I have a copy of Labor's submarine design here.

          , I rise on a point of order on direct relevance to the question. The question relates to a statement made by Dr John White. The question was about that statement and also the claims about the reasons why the Australian submarines cannot be built here.

               If government wants to avoid a capability gap, the timing of delivery and the rate of delivery can be arranged so that the new submarines can be introduced in lockstep with the Collins submarines as they are withdrawn from service.

                Mr Greenfield may well be right that they can be arranged that way, but I have to tell you that the government, given the delay, has very limited schedule options available to it because of the complete lack of work done by Labor. I happened to see Mr Swan this morning talking about the threat to national security of not building submarines in Australia. He was himself the single greatest threat to national security—

                   The minister was asked by Senator Wong, 'Why is the government ignoring advice?' The minister was going on to explain the advice. He has 31 seconds left to answer the question.

                    I should also say that there are many people who are giving gratuitous advice in this space who were retained by Defence South Australia. Independent, objective advice is very, very hard to find in this space. That is because I refuse to be drawn by people who are paid to give certain specific answers. I will rely on the defence chief to tell me which way we should go.

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. Why is the government ignoring the experts, misleading the public and breaking its promise—this minister's promise—to South Australians to build Australia's new submarines in Adelaide?

                      I said—and, of course, the Labor Party do not want to acknowledge what I said—in talking about the minister's two options that, 'On that basis, I accept what he has said, but if everything the minister says is based on fantasy we will tell you and we will revisit this.' What those opposite did was absolutely based on fantasy. There was no plan. There was no contract. There was no design. There was no money, because they took $20 billion out of the program. This is the biggest deception of the Australian public that I have ever seen in the national security space. You have stood there and said, 'We are going to build 12 submarines in Adelaide,' while ripping the process apart and misleading—
