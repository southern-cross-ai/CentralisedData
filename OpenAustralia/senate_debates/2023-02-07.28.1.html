       <p>
        I rise, as the former minister for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        , to discuss a piece of what I see as unfinished business, and that is the introduction of the NIIS, the National Injury Insurance Scheme. In 2011, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        recommended two schemes, not only the NDIS but also the NIIS, which is for people who have acquired catastrophic injuries—for example, in motor vehicle accidents, from falling off ladders et cetera—who don't qualify for the NDIS.
       </p>
       <p>
        As minister, I wrote to the then Treasurer, but unfortunately the election occurred. So, in September I wrote to the new Treasurer and to the ministers for health and for the NDIS. I haven't yet had a response, but I hope that's because they are actioning this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only is this scheme the right thing; it's economically sound, as it would take significant pressure off the NDIS. It would also provide people who have had catastrophic accidents and who are currently not covered by the NDIS with all the acute care, the rehabilitation and the disability supports they need to live the best life that they can after the accident they have had.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to pay special tribute to Kerri-Anne Kennerley, who has campaigned tirelessly, after the experience she had with her husband's accident. She noted that, while they had the financial resources to look after him, many others do not.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I commend the NIIS to this chamber, and I'd ask that, in due course, members support the private member's bill that I'll be bring forward to introduce this scheme. Hopefully it won't be necessary and the new government will act on this with the other states and territories.
