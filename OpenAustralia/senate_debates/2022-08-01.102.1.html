        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Minister Gallagher. With inflation and rate rises compounding existing housing and inequality crises, we need real action to address cost-of-living pressures. The Parliamentary Budget Office said Mr Morrison's stage 3 tax cuts will cost $224 billion over 10 years, whereas building a million affordable social homes over 20 years would be an investment of $128 billion, with only a $27.3 billion cost to government. Why are you backing the already wealthy rather than fixing the housing crisis, which is far cheaper?

        <p>
         Well, we're doing both. We will implement our election commitments, and one of those was—and we asked many times around this—around the stage 3 tax cuts. They have been legislated by the previous parliament, and we are not going to change that. That was our policy, and we made that decision probably 18 months before the campaign. As the Prime Minister has said, we will do in government what we said we would do during the campaign and in opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the housing crisis, yes, that means absolute priority attention from government. This is another one of those areas where nine years of neglect and refusal to work with states and territories have left us in the position that we are in now. We will pick up the mess left by the former government and work constructively with states and territories on how to best deal with the crisis in housing, particularly for those who need housing at the affordable end. We also have our Housing Australia Future Fund, which is one of those key commitments that we will roll out through the budget process to make sure the Commonwealth is back in the game of housing and housing policy, which those opposite absolutely neglected and didn't treat with the priority that they should have been dealt with for the nine years they were in government. We didn't have a housing minister for a long time. We didn't have a national housing policy; I don't think we ever had a national housing policy. These are the things that need fixing, working across the states and territories. They have a big stake in the game here and work with the federal government on improving access to housing and opportunities for housing, and we will do that.

              Having said that, I don't want to dismiss or trivialise the issue of costs of living for everybody at the moment, including young people. Particularly for those lower income households, there's no doubt that higher inflation and higher than expected inflation—significantly higher than what was in the PEFO update before the election—is putting enormous pressure on households, as are the rising interest rates, which are increasing because of this inflationary environment we're in. So government does need to focus on this. We are focusing on it. That's why the policies we took to the election are even more important to implement now.

                 Again, those were Greens policy commitments taken to the last election. They didn't form part of Labor's policy agenda. We are absolutely about implementing our policy commitments to put downward pressure on the cost of living, to lower the inflation that's ravaging the community and to put downward pressure where we can on people's cost of living. That is fundamentally a top priority for this government, and our policies on child care, on skills, on the National Reconstruction Fund and on the Powering Australia plan are all designed with that in mind—
