        Proposed amendments implement the Government's commitment to higher education reform to ensure the system remains accessible, affordable, high quality and fair for students and transparent, sustainable and accountable for taxpayers and providers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Higher education reform has been the subject of numerous reviews since 2014, including by the Senate Education and Employment committees and the Senate Scrutiny of Government Budget Measures committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Universities have called for certainty following years of deferred implementation of Budget measures and legislative arrangements. Implementation of these proposed higher education reforms will commence from 1 January 2018.

        <p>
         The opposition is moving two amendments to this report to ensure that the two education bills which deliver the government's latest policy announcements on funding for schools and higher education receive the appropriate scrutiny by Senate inquiries.
        </p>
        <p>
         The two bills are the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017 and the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. The schools package is a large and complex arrangement which covers all schools in Australia. The funding agreements the Commonwealth has released are only for the Commonwealth. States will be required to have to look at the arrangements and make their own commitments. At this stage, state governments have not been provided detail about funding in this complicated package.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is also a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         meeting scheduled in June to discuss the school funding issue, bearing in mind this meeting has been delayed several times. The only information available to stakeholders and parents is a website which outlines funding arrangements based on the government's new policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         There needs to be sufficient time to assess the impact of these measures across the system.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Committee
         </a>
         meetings across the winter break will ensure that all parents, teachers and stakeholders can have their say. It will also ensure that states and territories are not blindsided by a rushed legislative package from the Commonwealth.
        </p>
        <p>
         The higher education bill contains the government's latest higher education reform package, which represents a wholesale cut to universities and an impost on students. The nature of this package is also complex. There are $3.8 billion in cuts. Students have to pay more and faster, and a significant amount of analysis needs to be done. This includes measuring the impact of how repayment changes for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
          HELP
         </a>
         impact young Australians, especially at a time when they are entering the workforce, trying to save for a house and start a family.
        </p>
        <p>
         The package also flags around $500 million a year, or 7.5 per cent of the Commonwealth grants to universities, being pulled for performance funding. It is unclear how this will work. Universities are concerned about the implementation of this with its potential to be a 7.5 per cent cut. Further, the impact of the efficiency dividend and changes to postgraduate courses will have a significant impact on Australia's nearly 900,000 domestic university students.
        </p>
        <p>
         We believe greater scrutiny is required, and this is required through a considered committee inquiry. The government has had a year to devise this package. We believe the sector should have more than four weeks to allow the Senate to analyse it. So, in terms of our amendments, we would seek that both of those bills were referred to the education and employment legislation committee for a reporting date of 9 August to allow those proper consultations and scrutiny to occur.

         <p>
          I will not delay the chamber other than to say that the government believes that a month is a good and reasonable amount of time to give consideration to these packages of legislation. There has been, and will be, a high degree of scrutiny and interest in the various forums of the Senate. We expect that those will be fully deployed by colleagues in this place and that the time frame available is reasonable to do that.

           I rise to speak to the amendment originally moved by Senator Gallagher. I think it is a good compromise. A 9 August reporting date for both of these bills does give a substantial amount of time to look at the consequences. I want to be clear: I do know that there are some people and voices out there wanting certainty about what their funding models and funding packages will look like. And we have heard that.
          </p>
          <p>
           Weighing up those concerns and the ability for the Senate to inquire properly, I am glad that the Greens and the Labor Party have been able to get to a consistent position of a reporting date of 9 August.
