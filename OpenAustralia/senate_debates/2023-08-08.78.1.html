        The government wants to tighten the tax rules on the petroleum resource rent taxâ€”the PRRT. Labor wants to get a bit more tax from the gas companies. Senator Tyrrell and I and millions of other Aussies think they should go a hell of a lot harder. Let's remember: whether it's oil, gas or minerals, these resources belong to all Australians. They don't belong to the greedy gas companies, who, by the way, made an extra $40 billion in 2021-22 because of the war in Ukraine, off the suffering of others. Who would've guessed? The

        companies pay little or no tax, because it's not subject to royalties.

        But I reckon the government won't need to negotiate with us over these changes, because they'll team up with the opposition. Do you know why the red and blue teams will team up? I'll tell you why: it's to protect their party political donations. In the last 10 years, oil and gas companies have donated 11 million bucks to the Labor, Liberal, and National parties. That's a million bucks a year. Who's buying seats? And that's just the money we know about. Over a third of donations come from unknown sources, so you can bet your dirty dollars it'll be a lot higher than that. How about this government gets real on cleaning up all the big money coming into politics?
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia, watch out when the red and blue teams vote together, especially when it involves political donations, because I tell you it is not good for you Australians. The only people they're thinking about are themselves. They forgot about the country. When it comes to political donations, it's all about self up here and nothing else. It is not about putting Australians first. This is becoming a real problem. I will take you two teams seriously when you decide that, when it comes to political donations, you no longer take them from these sorts of companies. Why don't you show us that you've actually got some courage and put something in, in writing, and stop it today?
