        I rise today to speak on the Aboriginal Land Grant (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jervis_Bay_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Jervis Bay Territory
        </a>
        ) Amendment (Strengthening Land and Governance Provisions) Bill 2022. The coalition continues to support it. The bill makes critical changes and updates to the existing legislation that governs the Aboriginal community at Wreck Bay and the Jervis Bay Territory. The bill is the result of much hard work that I am proud to say began under the previous coalition government. It is yet another example of the coalition's longstanding commitment to working with Indigenous communities to find the best solutions to the challenges they face. I am pleased that the work has continued under the current government and acknowledge the work of the local member and the Minister for

        ,

        </a>
        , for seeing it through to this conclusion. This bill will have a significant and positive impact for the people of the Wreck Bay community. We heard their concerns directly from them when they made representation at a Senate committee hearing. The bill will exempt certain leases granted by the council, those for a term of 40 years or more, from the application of the

        </a>
        1997. It will help to facilitate registered members voluntarily entering into a homeownership-style lease with the council and increase the payment amount at which the council must seek approval from the minister before entering into a contract, from $100,000 to $1 million. I also note the contribution of Senator Thorpe, whose suggestion for agreements to be provided in writing the coalition has supported.

        This bill was introduced under the last term of government in largely identical form to the one before us today. Regrettably, it did not pass the parliament before the last election. This is the result of an extensive consultation process across two federal governments, a process which saw the community engaged to ensure that the best outcome was achieved for them, and that community consensus was reached. I've been informed that, shortly after she took the position of shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, my colleague Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price spoke with the Wreck Bay
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and confirmed that this bill is what they want. It would be remiss of me not to point out that this outcome was achieved successfully using existing consultation and advisory processes. Governments formed of both major parties were able to use the National Indigenous Australians Agency and other existing pathways to extensively consult with the community and reach an outcome that the community approved of. The community of Jarvis Bay were heard. Their needs were listened to, and a suitable outcome was reached. This bill has been a long time coming. The people of Wreck Bay community don't want more talk. They want to see the change made. It's time we get this done. The opposition supports this bill.
