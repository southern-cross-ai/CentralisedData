        My question as to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Senator Cash. Minister, there are a large number of people in Afghanistan who were issued 449 visas by the immigration minister during the fall of Kabul. These visas were of three months duration and are about to start expiring.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        advice during the fall of Kabul and since has been that Afghan nationals in Afghanistan who hold Australian visas should not attempt to leave Afghanistan due to the dangers of such a journey. Many who chose to ignore that advice are now safely in Australia. But those who followed the DFAT advice and stayed in Afghanistan are watching their visas run down, and all your government is doing is advising them to apply for other classes of visa. The 449 visas represent a lifeline for people in danger—a lifeline that you cannot in conscience snatch away. Will the minister do the right thing and extend those 449 visas and preserve the lifeline of safety from the Taliban that was offered three months ago?

           The point of order is relevance. The minister is reading from a pre-prepared brief on locally engaged employees. That was most emphatically not part of the question I asked. I asked specifically about 449 visa holders.

             What I was saying is that it's a high priority of the Morrison government. That is why, on 18 November 2021, the Australian government announced that the subclass 449 visas granted to Afghans who supported Australia's mission in Afghanistan, and their families, who had not yet arrived in Australia, would be extended on an ongoing basis. This includes subclass 449 holders who are certified locally engaged employees of the

              Department of Defence

             , the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the

              Australian Federal Police
             </a>
             , and other persons who have working relationships with the Australian government. It was also announced that those outside the locally engaged employee program who were granted a subclass 449 visa that will expire are to receive priority in Australia's humanitarian and refugee intake.

               Very little or no comfort there, Minister. The government has said that it will not return or refoul any Afghan national currently in Australia. But what are you doing to ensure they have durable solutions in their lives—priority access to family reunion and pathways to permanent residency? Will you help these people and their families find permanent safety or will you continue to leave them in limbo with the threat of being returned to Afghanistan hanging over their heads?

                   , you don't need to add commentary. You have brought the minister back to the question. I'm listening very carefully to the minister's answer. Minister I would remind you that there's a requirement to answer the question and I give you the call.

                    , to the extent that I don't have the information you're seeking I will seek to get it. I am trying, however, to provide you with the relevant information that I do have, in particular in terms of the permanent visa pathway for Afghan refugees. As I was actually saying, Australia's migration law changed on 12 November of this year to allow Afghan evacuees in Australia who hold a subclass 449 visa to apply for an offshore humanitarian visa.

                      Minister, there are just under 7½ thousand Afghan nationals outside Australia who are waiting to have their partner visas processed. These are partners of Australian citizens or permanent residents. Some are in hiding in Afghanistan and at risk of imminent death. That includes, of course, many women and children. Many thousands have been waiting for years for their partner visas to be processed. Will the minister issue them 449 visas so they can come to Australia and be safe while their substantive visas are being processed?

                       , the government, as you would know, recognises the importance of family reunion for refugees and humanitarian entrants. You would also know that our humanitarian program reunites refugees and people who are in refugee-like situations overseas with their family in Australia.
