        International Women's Day

       <p>
        6 March 2014
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        International Women's Day is held on March 8 each year. It is an opportunity to celebrate the achievements that have been made by women and for women over many decades.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        International Women's Day is set aside every year to also focus our attention on the ongoing obstacles to gender equality – including violence, oppression and economic insecurity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This year's theme "Equality for women is progress for all" highlights how the empowerment of women is critical to both economic and social development across the world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I hold the strong view that, as people living in a free and democratic society, we have a fundamental obligation to speak out and protect the human rights of women both here in Australia and overseas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        International Women's Day ensures that we don't just acknowledge and celebrate the rights that we in the West have achieved, it also focuses our attention and energy on improving the condition of women internationally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst we have much to celebrate in Australia in terms of female empowerment, there is still a way to go and much of that is attitudinal and cultural change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe the major difference between empowerment of women in developed and developing nations is that the former - women like us - have the 'freedom to' stand on the shoulders of the women who have gone before us - to achieve more; women however in developing nations still need 'freedom from' - freedom from poverty and other limiting factors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ultimately however our aims are similar. True empowerment can only be achieved when girls and women are valued equally to boys and men.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        International Women's Day ensures that we as the Parliament embrace the challenge of empowering women and girls.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will continue to devote ourselves to improving women's participation in the workforce, and as business leaders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will continue the work being done to eliminate violence against women and their children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will continue to reaffirm Australia's role as a global citizen to improve the safety, and economic empowerment of women and girls internationally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Gender equality is a key priority for this Government both domestically and internationally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am currently working with State and Territory Ministers on the Second Action Plan under the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. This will be an opportunity to ensure that efforts to preventing violence against women become a whole community issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's recent appointment of Ambassador Natasha Stott Despoja reflects our commitment to be at the forefront of efforts to promote the empowerment of women and girls.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am making sure that there is measurable progress against the responsibilities outlined in our National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security 2012–2018. This progress will be reported mid-year, and will be presented to you then.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am leading the

        delegation to the 58th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status for Women, which begins next week. Australia will be keen to negotiate a post-2015 development agenda which focuses on the economic empowerment of women as a driver of global economic growth and poverty reduction.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Achieving a strong, progressive outcome that prioritises gender equality and women's empowerment is critical. Australia's commitment to this vision is unwavering.
