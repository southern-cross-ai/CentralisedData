         The Rudd government believes that the first responsibility of government is to protect the safety and the security of the Australian people. That is why this government has made national security reform a top priority. Today, the Rudd government released a further piece of its national security reform agenda: the counterterrorism white paper
         <i>
          Securing Australia, protecting our community
         </i>
         . As the Prime Minister stated earlier today, it is important not to become complacent about the threat terrorism poses to Australia’s national security, because the threat is not diminishing. In fact, the government’s security and intelligence agencies assess that terrorism has become a persistent and permanent feature of Australia’s security environment. They warn that an attack could occur at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
         More than 100 Australians have been killed in terrorist attacks since 2001, including 88 in the 2002 Bali bombing. The international threat of terrorism is persistent and it is evolving. The white paper outlines two key shifts in the terrorist threat to Australia. There have been some counterterrorism successes, notably in South-East Asia and in exerting pressure on al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but these have been offset by newer areas of concern such as Somalia and Yemen. Secondly, Australia now faces an increased terrorist threat from people born or raised in Australia who take inspiration from international jihadist narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Australia since 2001, 38 people have been prosecuted as a result of counterterrorism operations and 20 people have been convicted of terrorism offences under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
          Criminal Code
         </a>
         . Over 40 Australians have had their passports revoked or denied for reasons related to terrorism, so the threat is real. As the Prime Minister stated, no government can guarantee that Australia will be free from the threat of terrorism, but we can guarantee we will take all necessary steps to combat the threat.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister provide further details to the Senate about the $69 million investment in biometrics collection and how this will help strengthen our borders and protect Australia from the threat of terrorism?

           As a border security and counterterrorism initiative, the Rudd government will commence the collection of biometrics from visa applicants overseas for checking against international and national biometric databases and alert lists. Biometric information like this provides the Australian government agencies with information that can be used to detect people trying to conceal their identity when they seek to enter Australia. The initiative complements the government’s announcement in early February of an investment of $200 million in aviation security.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under the new arrangements, nationals of any country who apply for a non-electronic visa in one of 10 selected posts will be required to attend a visa application centre, where their biometrics will be collected. The fingerprints taken will be checked against Australian biometric databases as well as partner countries’ databases. We hope in this way to make a serious effort to add to our border security measures.

              That is what Senator Birmingham said. I think those comments are disgraceful. I remind those opposite that 100 Australians have died at the hands of terrorists since 2001. Trying to make cheap political points when discussing the threat of terrorism is below Senator Birmingham—I expected better of him.

                We have had a serious threat from terrorism. The government expects the opposition to join with it in treating that threat seriously. We expect them to show leadership as the alternative government. I request the Liberal Party to show that leadership rather than what we have seen today.
