         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:

         Navy
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For the period 1 July 2010 â€“ 30 June 2011:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) (a) (b) Navy allocates training days to individual Funded Reserve Commitment (

          STRP
         </a>
         ) positions that are linked to Navy capability requirements. These positions are allocated to establishments, units and departments across Navy and non-Navy components. These days can be used anytime during the training (financial) year, and are not allocated on a half yearly basis. While just under $25m was allocated for Reserve salaries for

          Financial Year
         </a>
         2010/11, just under $20m was expended in the first half. The unused funds were re-allocated for use in the second half of the financial year, which coincided with a review of the allocation across Navy and non-Navy components. The subsequent re-allocation included changes to the rank levels of

          Navy Reserve
         </a>
         personnel employed, with mainly higher ranks to be employed in the second half of the financial year, meaning that while spending would be maintained, the number of actual days used would reduce. A total of 93,169 training days were allocated used across Navy for the entire Financial Year 2010/11 as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) (a) (b) Navy can only provide actual training day and budget expenditure on a national basis. A total of 83,412 training days and $22,674,177 were expended across Navy and non-Navy components for the entire Financial Year 2010/11.
