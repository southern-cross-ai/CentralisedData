        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to confirmation by the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department that the Attorney-General asked him to, 'Formally put on the table with Professor Triggs a specific role.' Was the specific role discussed with the Prime Minister, his chief of staff or any member of his office before it was put on the table?

         Senator Collins, I addressed this issue yesterday, as a matter of fact. And as I said to you yesterday—or perhaps it was to Senator Wong—the evidence that Mr Moraitis gave to the Senate estimates committee last Tuesday and the evidence that I gave to the Senate estimates committee last Tuesday was entirely accurate and I have nothing to add to it.
        </p>

         I know you find it very difficult—

It is no secret that I have lost confidence in Professor Triggs, and in the debate yesterday I explained why. But it is also the case that, as I said to the Senate estimates committee last Tuesday—

                    I am coming to the question, but I just make the point that just because a person may not do a satisfactory job in one role does not mean that they would not be very good at a different job. Take the case of Senator Wong, for instance, who, as the world knows, was a very bad finance minister but a very good backstabber! A backstabber as Mr Rudd, Ms Gillard and former senator

                     , I rise on a point of order of relevance. Senator Brandis is clearly enjoying himself. It is in no way relevant to the question that he was asked. It was a very specific question, and I would ask you to bring him back to the question.

                        , I ask a supplementary question. I ask again: was the specific role discussed with the Prime Minister, his chief of staff or any member of his office before it was put on the table, and was the specific role discussed with the foreign minister or her office before it was put on the table—not who decided it, who was it discussed with?

                           I think I can. I cannot do any better than reminding Senator Collins again of what I said at the Senate estimates: that, as a matter of goodwill towards Professor Triggs and in earnest of my good intentions towards her, I did say to Mr Moraitis that I hoped Professor Triggs could be encouraged or would be willing to serve the government in other capacities. I do not see anything unusual or irregular about that whatsoever.
