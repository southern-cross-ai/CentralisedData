          Minister, many ex-service men and women have spoken of the difficulty they experience fitting back into civilian life and getting established after life in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Defence Force
          </a>
          . Often they join young and find it difficult adapting back into society after the structure of military life. Finding work and housing, coping with physical and mental disabilities and adjusting to civilian life in general become a daily challenge. Minister, does the government recognise the range of problems that many ex-service men and women experience in settling back into civilian life?

            <p>
             The short answer is yes, the government does recognise the magnificent service that our
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
              Defence Force
             </a>
             personnel provide. We do recognise that too many of them leave their service injured, whether that is through mental injury or physical injury, and they do deserve all of our support as they leave their distinguished service for our nation. Between 5,500 and 6,000 ADF members leave the ADF annually. The government is committed to ensuring that former serving ADF members have access to services and support to help them in post-service life, including rehabilitation treatment, compensation and income support, to ensure that the transition from the ADF into civilian life is as seamless as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government has made a significant investment in a range of problems targeting transition—employment assistance, suicide prevention and support for families, improving transition support and future employment assistance programs—for current and former serving ADF members and their families. We are providing $196 million per year for mental health support for veterans, including the provision of free treatment for any mental health condition to all those who have served at least one day in full-time ADF service and reservists with certain service experience. There is $8.3 million going to further develop, promote and implement the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program; and, to support veterans' transition to civilian life, $4.3 million of this will provide additional services to help and support veterans who are finding the transition to the civilian workforce challenging.

              <p>
               Minister, I do understand that they go through a transition period. Would the government consider a transition period over a span of three months where they can have a graduated discharge to help them find their feet—for example, going from seven days of service a week to five days, then three, and then, finally, one day a week, until they are fully discharged?

               <p>
                The government is always looking for ways—and I think that is an entirely non-partisan matter. I think all senators would support efforts to continue to consider and explore ways we can better support our veterans and to ensure that the transitional support, given the challenges that too many of them face on leaving the ADF, is as good as it can be. In that spirit, the government is always very happy to consider any suggestions Senator Hanson has in that regard.

                   I believe all Australians are very grateful for the service provided by ADF personnel. Of course, we always consider how the support services and the services assisting them in terms of transitional assistance, including employment assistance, can be further improved. There are a whole range of services that are available at present, and we will continue to work with all interested members and senators to continue to improve the services that are available.
