        Later today I will be moving an attendance motion. This motion will call on Senator Thorpe to attend this chamber and give a full explanation as to why she, as a voting member of the Law Enforcement Committee, didn't disclose a personal relationship she had at the time with the former president of an outlaw bikie gang while the committee was providing members with sensitive information about outlaw bikie gangs. Senator Thorpe admitted that she and Mr Martin communicated via the encrypted communications app Signal and deleted messages to each other once a week. Her staff strongly advised her to inform the committee and to inform Greens leader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bandt" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , but she ignored their advice and concealed the relationship. Her staff took it upon themselves to inform Mr Bandt's office.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge and accept the decision of this chamber to refer Senator Thorpe to the Privileges Committee. However, don't the people of Australia have the right to a full explanation on the floor of parliament? Don't the Australian people deserve that Senator Thorpe be held accountable for the obvious and naked contempt that she has for this parliament and for most of you sitting in it? Call me cynical or a sceptic or just plain illogical, but I am concerned that the Privileges Committee will keep this matter behind closed doors and that Labor senators, who need the Greens' support for their agenda, will protect Senator Thorpe. If you're not willing for her to give a full explanation here, then not only are you failing the Australian people but you are sending out a message that the Senate is a protection racket and you will further undermine public trust and confidence in this parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure many Greens cringe when Senator Thorpe opens her mouth and they all have greater political acumen than she does, so it makes me wonder if her appointment as the Senate deputy leader was pure tokenism.
