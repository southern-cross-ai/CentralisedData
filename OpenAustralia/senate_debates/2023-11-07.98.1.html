        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. Stabilising our relationship with China is vitally important for Australia and important for Australian exporting businesses and workers. After all, China is our largest trading partner. Yesterday the Prime Minister met with China's President Xi in Beijing to continue stabilising our relationship and continue advocating for removal of the outstanding trade impediments affecting high-quality Australian products. How are the government's efforts to stabilise our trade relationship with China delivering practical outcomes for Australian exporters, producers and workers?

          My mum used to say self-praise was no recommendation. I thank Senator Stewart for her question. I know just how important trade is to the great state of Victoria. Yesterday we witnessed a historic moment in our bilateral relationship with China when Prime Minister Albanese met with President Xi. This visit to China marked the 50th anniversary of Gough Whitlam's first visit to China. Positive, constructive dialogue is a win-win for both our economies. It delivers practical benefits for Australian exporters, businesses and workers. By having a more stable relationship with China, we've seen the return of so many wonderful Australian products to a market of 1.4 billion consumers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since coming to government, we've faced an incredible $20 billion worth of trade impediments on Australian exporters, but in the last 18 months we have made enormous progress. Between January and August of this year, Australia exported to China $6 billion worth of products that were previously subject to trade impediments. That is $6 billion worth of high-quality Australian product that has now re-entered Chinese markets due to the stabilisation efforts of our government.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yes, and Murray was helping too—don't you worry. It's a team effort—team Australia! We know that the barley farmers, the miners, the forestry workers, the hay producers—even the fruit pickers of this country in

Our government knows that, on the one hand, we need to stabilise our trading relationship with China but, on the other hand, we actively support Australian exporters diversifying their trade and supply chains, because, over the last few years, we've seen the perils of having all of your eggs in the one basket.

                  stadiums. Australia is economically stronger when global trade flows freely. We know that one in four Australian jobs relate to trade, and jobs in export industries pay five per cent higher wages on average. In addition, we know that trade creates a competitive environment, lowering prices and helping reduce the costs of living for everyday Australians, which is why we've worked so hard in the last year to deliver opportunities that advance our trade agenda by implementing trade agreements with India and the United Kingdom—something that the previous government, of course, couldn't do. This government is ensuring that trade—
