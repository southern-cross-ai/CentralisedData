        Today I acknowledge 40 years of remarkable work from a small and highly effective agency in my portfolio. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research was established by parliament in June 1982 to commission and fund research to find solutions to the agricultural problems of developing countries. Since then, ACIAR has returned total benefits worth at least $64 billion in economic, environmental and social impacts, with a benefit-to-cost ratio of around 43 to one—not to mention the social and environmental benefits like women's empowerment, nutritional improvements and wildlife habitat protection.
       </p>

        It was Sir John Crawford, long-serving secretary of the department of agriculture and later Vice-Chancellor and Chancellor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">
         ANU
        </a>
        , who in the 1970s—like now, a time of global food insecurity—promoted the idea that Australian agricultural, fisheries and forestry science has much to offer the world==and we do. Today, ACIAR oversees about 200 projects a year in 35 countries across the Indo-Pacific region to achieve more productive and sustainable agrifood systems. Its work is emblematic of the government 's approach to building a more stable and prosperous region, partnering directly with our neighbours to deliver real solutions to improve crop yields and livestock health; to manage fisheries and forests; to mitigate climate change; to inform and protect against biosecurity threats; and to empower communities, boost livelihoods, reduce poverty and build resilience. So today in the Senate I congratulate ACIAR on its 40-year history of achievement—achievement for communities around the world and for our country. I offer the government's thanks on behalf of the parliament and the people of Australia to all who have contributed to ACIAR's work. They do remarkable work, and we thank them for it.
