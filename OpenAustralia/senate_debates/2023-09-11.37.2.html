        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Does the minister believe it was appropriate to deliberately hide from the United States, until the day before its public release, the decision of the Albanese Labor government to axe the National Space Mission for Earth Observation program? What knowledge did the minister have of this deliberate strategy?

         Thank you, President, and I note your generosity to the opposition in starting question time early. Senator Birmingham, I don't agree with the way in which the question's been put to me. Our relationship with the United States is deep and enduring. We have significant cooperation on space. In relation to this particular budget decision, the United States was advised ahead of time, as was appropriate. In terms of my engagement, this is obviously a budget decision. The senator has been a finance minister—
        </p>
        <p>
         And I'm a member of the expenditure review committee. I was trying to allude to that, but I'm happy to explain it. We have had to make some tough choices, which is why this government has found budget savings to rein in the deficit, to tackle inflation. We've started the hard work to rebuild fiscal buffers. Unlike those opposite, we're actually delivering on that, as opposed to making sure we have mugs on our parliamentary desks saying 'Back in black'.

         A lot of mugs over there, yes. But I would say to Senator Birmingham that I was pleased, at

         , to be part of further announcements in relation to space programs, with an announcement that was made with the Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin at the Brisbane AUSMIN in July, which probably indicates our view about the relevance of this matter of space coordination to our relationship and to our ongoing cooperation across a range of fronts.

           Why was it—and I quote from government emails released under freedom of information laws—'an express preference from the minister and

            PMO
           </a>
           that the US be notified no earlier than Wednesday', the day prior to announcement? Did the minister or her office express concerns with this deliberately tricky and deceptive approach? Or did the government not trust the United States with the information?

            It's really disappointing to see a senior member of the opposition, the alternative government—in fact, the shadow minister for foreign affairs and former trade minister—speaking in those terms about our ally, or implying for partisan political purposes any issue with our ally. It says something about you and about the way in which you approach foreign policy in this place, Senator Birmingham.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what I would say to you is this. You asked about 'the minister', I think, a couple of times in the question, one time referring to me and the other time I assume referring to Senator Husic. I assume 'the minister' you were referring to is Minister Husic, because you are quoting from the DISR

            . So, I'll answer the question in two parts. First, in relation to the first part, the US was advised ahead of time, as was appropriate, and I can confirm that—

               (—) (): Well, I'm asked a question about truthfulness by a former member of the Morrison cabinet. I'm asked a question about truthfulness in relation to discussions with allies. I might remember Senator Payne when she was dispatched along with the then defence minister who were not allowed to do anything other than, if not deliberately mislead, certainly mislead by omission, the government of France and their counterparts in France because of Mr Morrison's obsession with secrecy. What I would say to you is that we have, as you might recall from Senator Blinken's comments at

               , not only an historically deep and trusting relationship with the United States but, as a matter between principals, we work extremely closely together and we are good friends and we treat them accordingly.
