        by leave—On behalf of the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, I table a ministerial statement on the conclusion of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the statement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm very pleased that this statement was made yesterday during the guest of government visit by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands
        </a>
        , the Hon. Manasseh Sogavare MP. In particular, it gives me great pride and satisfaction to note that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMSI" rel="nofollow">
         RAMSI
        </a>
        as it was known, concluded its mission on 30 June this year.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Helpem_Fren" rel="nofollow">
         Operation Helpem Fren
        </a>
        ended after 14 years of Australian-led support. Australia, through governments on both sides of politics, provided the leadership and a substantial share of the human and financial resources that initiated, powered and sustained this critical and highly regarded regional intervention. It was essentially a civilian-led policing operation intended to re-establish law and order and implement the necessary governance and economic reforms to provide the Solomon Islands with a firm foundation on which to build its future security and prosperity. This was reinforced by the Solomon Islands domestic enabling legislation. RAMSI was also endorsed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Island
        </a>
        s Forum, so the legal foundation for its presence in the Solomon Islands was therefore very strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1998 to 2003 the Solomon Islands was being pulled apart by lawlessness, violence and rampant criminality. The causes were complex, but ethnic and provincial tensions and relocation were at the core of the conflict. By July 2003 the Solomon Islands was well on the way to becoming a failed state. Its economy had ceased to function. The state was no longer providing even the most basic of services, including water and electricity, and basic law and order had broken down. Children were not going to school and were often press-ganged into the service of marauding militants. These same militias were literally holding the government to ransom, extorting money from the state's near-empty coffers.
       </p>
       <p>
        So in July 2003, after much deliberation, the Howard government made the decision to help the Solomon Islands government bring the country back from the precipice. The Howard government well understood that the ills which were plaguing the Solomon Islands could quickly spread throughout the region. While RAMSI was led by Australia, its success lay in the fact that it was a genuinely regional initiative, having been established under a treaty to which all 15 contributing Pacific Island countries, including New Zealand and Australia, were parties. Our Pacific neighbours collectively contributed thousands of police, military, diplomatic and advisory personnel to the mission. It has set an important precedent and provides us with a model for future regional collaboration. RAMSI was particularly successful in achieving its immediate priority of re-establishing law and order. In the first week, more than 3,700 guns were collected and destroyed. In its third week, the surrender of renegade militants was negotiated with the help of mediators. By the end of the third year, 6,300 arrests had been made for militant and criminal activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2017 Solomon Islands presents a very different picture. Whilst islanders today face many unresolved challenges, life has long since returned to relative normality. I've had the privilege of visiting the Solomon Islands four times in my role as Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development" rel="nofollow">
         International Development
        </a>
        and the Pacific. I have seen the national health services helping to distribute medicines in the outer provinces, I've seen the infrastructure developments—the roads, bridges and wharves, which provide the lifeblood of economic growth. I have seen how the women of the Solomon Islands are working together to promote private enterprise, advocate for better services and combat domestic violence. I've seen how Australian aid dollars are supporting these good works.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         The Solomon Islands
        </a>
        is reaping the benefits of stability, with the economy having grown more than 80 per cent in the first 10 years of RAMSI. Underpinning this growth is an effective, functioning and rehabilitated police force, of which about one-third are women, which has not only been remoulded to once again provide the nation's front line of security but has also delivered training to other police forces in the Pacific and is now contributing to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        peacekeeping in Sudan.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of this came at a cost. More importantly, I want to acknowledge the human cost. Six RAMSI officers lost their lives over its term, including four Australians: Private Jamie Clark, 3rd Battalion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        , ADF;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Dunning" rel="nofollow">
         Adam Dunning
        </a>
        , Protective Service Officer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        ;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Lewis" rel="nofollow">
         Ronald Lewis
        </a>
        , Protective Service Officer, Australian Federal Police; and Tony Scriva, a civilian adviser to the Solomon Islands government. They will always be remembered for their sacrifice. Australia invested approximately $2.8 billion of the $3 billion cost over the 14 years of the operation. And the cost to Australia, financial and otherwise, would have been far greater had we not acted when we did.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now it is imperative that the gains from RAMSI be preserved. Prime Minister Sogavare understands better than anyone the importance and complexities of the challenges which lie ahead, and he has dedicated himself and his government to tackling them head on. But the Solomon Islands will not do it alone, and Prime Minister Sogavare has our full support. In June this year, on behalf of the Australian government, I signed a three-year aid partnership agreement between our two countries which establishes our shared vision for cooperation to foster inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction and stability in the Solomon Islands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately, however, to achieve these goals the Solomon Islands government will need to maintain law and order and stability for a sustained period. To this end, Australia and the Solomon Islands have worked to develop a package of assistance to consolidate bilaterally the work that RAMSI has up to now driven. This includes a policing program under which we have placed 44
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        advisers in Honiara to mentor, train and advise the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. This will be complemented by new bilateral programs of support for justice and governance. This package will amount to $141 million over four years, from 2017 to 2021. This is part of our overseas development assistance to the Solomon Islands, which in 2017-18 will be $142.2 million. On Monday, our governments also signed a bilateral security treaty, the first of its kind in the Pacific. The treaty will enable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , police and civilian personnel to deploy operationally in emergency situations to provide security or humanitarian assistance at the Solomon Islands government's request.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regional security cooperation in the Solomons did not begin with RAMSI. Last week, I had the honour and privilege to represent Australia at the commemorations in Honiara marking the 75th anniversary of the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . During the war, Australian Coastwatchers worked side by side with island scouts to report on movements and intentions of Japanese forces, work of vital intelligence importance to the Allies. As Australian Coastwatcher John Keenan recalled:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Without local help I don't know what we would have done. We wouldn't have lasted ten minutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The achievements of the Coastwatchers were summed up by US Fleet Admiral Halsey:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal, and Guadalcanal saved the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the longstanding strong ties between our nations and our peoples, in 2003 it was natural for the Solomon Islands to turn to Australia for help in its hour of need. In 2017, as RAMSI prepared to leave, it was equally natural for the Solomon Islanders to ask whether Australia would continue to stand by their side. Australia is inseparably connected to the Solomon Islands and the Pacific region, which is why we responded with a resounding yes to Helpem Fren.

        <p>
         I'm really pleased to be able to share this afternoon in the acknowledgement of the work of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMSI" rel="nofollow">
          RAMSI
         </a>
         , the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. I particularly note the other title that it has, which I think is very meaningful and encapsulates the whole meaning of this exercise—that is,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Helpem_Fren" rel="nofollow">
          Operation Helpem Fren
         </a>
         . In that focus, it talks about how this operation was conceived. It was a cry for help from one of our friends in the Pacific, the Solomon Islands.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that over a period of time there had been violence and disruption in this beautiful country and there was a need for support. At that time, the Solomon Islands cried for help from a friend. Australia, under Prime Minister Howard, responded to that call. But it wasn't only Australia. As we know, one of the real strengths of the RAMSI exercise was the way that the countries of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Island
         </a>
         s Forum gathered together and made a joint commitment that they would work with the people and the government of the Solomon Islands to ensure that there would be real peace and security in that community.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think that over the period of time 2003-17 we saw 15 island nations, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          Australia and New Zealand
         </a>
         , working together, bringing their skills, professionalism, commitment and sense of area—a sense of being part of the Pacific—to make sure that RAMSI, Operation Helpem Fren, would be a success, and that we would see what we have seen now. We have seen a country that has re-established law and order, a country that has new friends across the Pacific who have worked together to make sure that there will be security in the region, a thriving economy, the opportunity for children to go to school and an opportunity for an effective police force. One of the core elements of this particular process was this commitment to effective law and order and a strong, trained professional police force.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Fierravanti-Wells and I have many shared experiences. One of those experiences was a visit to the Solomon Islands earlier this year with Senator Wong and Minister Bishop. Among other things, we met with people who had been part of the policing program, and we heard Minister Bishop talk about the pride with which all the participants in RAMSI had seen the way that the police were able to develop not just in their own area, but also to a well-trained organisation that was sharing their skills now, taking the Operation Helpem Fren to help other friends, to ensure that we build on this basis. Minister Bishop particularly mentioned the fact that training is now provided by the Solomon Islands to other Pacific island states. They deploy officers to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         missions across the world, and support disaster relief funds in neighbouring states—places like Vanuatu, following Cyclone Pam.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the real joys of that visit was to see the pride of the newly recruited women members of the police force standing shoulder-to-shoulder in their community of police, to proudly take on the role they had chosen. They had careers working in security for their community. One of the particular elements was engagement in the newly formed domestic violence laws in that nation. That is so inspiring to other countries and so inspiring to the community across all the Solomon Islands. They know that their government, their police force and their community now are committed to ensuring that women and families are safe. The work with the domestic violence shelter provided a high point, I think, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, of our visit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Fierravanti-Wells mentioned the loss of life during the commitment to RAMSI, and that has been acknowledged in the other place, where two beautiful speeches were made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
          Bill Shorten
         </a>
         . I have obtained Senator Fierravanti-Wells' approval to table both those speeches. I think they should be tabled. I was particularly impressed by the way Bill Shorten was able to link the history of our relationship with the Solomon Islands to the example and the experience we had through RAMSI and also for hope into the future. It is important to look at the future, because this period, the RAMSI Helpem Fren period, has now been concluded. But that, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells pointed out, is not the end of a relationship; it is the hope for the future of the relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to mention the photographic display that was launched yesterday in this place. The photos were truly beautiful, confronting and inspiring images that looked at the hope for the next phase in the Solomon Islands' community and government. These pictures pulsated with a sense of hope for an optimistic future. Women, families, young people gathered together to acknowledge and celebrate the work of RAMSI but were also looking to the future. We know now of the signed commitments into the future of our ongoing working relationship with our friend, Solomon Islands. We know that there is great hope for this time. We know that our government is committed totally to ensuring that that relationship will continue.
        </p>
        <p>
         This has been a genuinely successful exercise in terms of: the engagement of the people across the Pacific; the acknowledgement that there was a need for an intervention; the acknowledgement that that must be done with partnership; and, also, the rebuilding of communities so that when there are more calls—and there will be more calls not just in the Pacific but across our world for support, for help—we know there will be a sound basis, through the work that was done through RAMSI, for further operations of helping friends to be there and to be successful.
