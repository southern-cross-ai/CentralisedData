        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator McKenzie. Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg has said, 'It is quite clear that we should be looking to commit to net zero.' Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree with Senator Bragg?

         Thank you very much for the question, Senator Ayres. I've made it very, very clear that we as a party room are considering the question of committing to net zero by 2050 and what the implications are for rural and regional Australia. Labor senator after Labor senator is going to quote me Liberal Party senators. Well, they don't sit in my party room. The people who are actually considering this question are National Party senators and MPs, who have been very, very clear—whether it's Anne Webster, who a couple of months ago said, 'We're not signing up to a blank cheque,', whether it's Matt Canavan—you can probably catch him this evening on Sky—who has often made his views, very, very clear on this issue, or whether it's Senator Perin Davey. On Chris Kenny's show, she made it very, very clear that it's our agriculturists and our farmers who paid the price of our Kyoto targets.
        </p>
        <p>
         This may not resonate for you because you don't live where we live and you don't serve the people we serve. Out of sight is out of mind for the major parties in this building.
        </p>
        <p>
         So it is the National Party who, once again, stand before a policy that, if not implemented appropriately, will severely impact on rural and regional Australia and will severely impact on mining, agriculture and manufacturing. We need to make sure that we've assessed the plan that's being put to us to understand the implications and to proceed in a calm and reasonable manner, with the Liberal Party, on a pathway forward.

           Liberal MP Jason Falinski has said economic benefits for Australia in signing up to net zero by 2050 are 'overwhelming' and 'can't be understated'. If Mr Falinski is correct, why are the Nationals still refusing to sign up to net zero by 2050?

            For 100 years, rural and regional Australians have been sending National Party and, before us, Country Party MPs to Canberra to do one thing and one thing only—to stand up for the interests of rural and regional Australia and our industries. All we are doing is our job. We are doing our job. We are seeing a pathway to net zero that's been put to us in our party room and are carefully considering that. That is what our constituents expect of us. That is a sensible and rational thing to do. We are two parties of government. This most successful coalition has been maintained in this country for 75 years, and we have delivered not just for the regions but for the whole country.

              Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman has said net zero by 2050 is 'the right thing to do'. Does this minister agree with Mr Zimmerman that net zero by 2050 is the right thing to do? If not, why not?

               I'm happy to table my opinion pieces of recent times on this issue on why I think we need to adopt a cautious approach. We need to make sure we're doing the right thing by our people. If we're not standing up for those with the lowest median income in the country, who are in National Party seats, then we aren't doing our jobs.

               If it is such a good idea, what happened under Rudd and Gillard? What happened when you had the chance to do the miracle dream team deal between the Greens and Labor? You walked away from it. You never really assessed what happened to the regions.
