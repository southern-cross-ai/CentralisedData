       <p>
        by leave—I thank the Senate for leave to make this statement. A similar statement will be made by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives. Overnight in the Indian city of Mumbai there has been a series of coordinated attacks on hotels, train stations and other public places. It is unclear at this stage who is responsible for those attacks, although one organisation has claimed responsibility. The Australian government unreservedly condemns the atrocious attacks on innocent people in Mumbai, whoever carried them out. I know that is a sentiment that is shared by all senators in this chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we speak, events are still unfolding, but we understand that up to 80 people have been killed and 250 injured. Our sympathy and condolences go to the victims and their families. Attackers still may be in hotels and there are reports that hostages have been taken. The government is seeking to confirm as a matter of urgency the safety and welfare of Australians who may be affected. We have 317 Australians registered with us as being in Mumbai. Our consular staff are currently attempting to contact all of the Australians who are registered. At least two Australians have been injured and our thoughts are with them and their families. We have been advised that Australian casualty numbers may rise. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        has been in contact with the families in Australia and of course is providing consular assistance in Mumbai. Australians who are concerned about the welfare of loved ones can contact a hotline that has been established by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The number of the consular hotline is 1800 002 214.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister has just spoken to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian High Commission
        </a>
        er to India, who is in Mumbai and is leading the government’s consular response. Officials from the Australian Consulate General in Mumbai and the Australian High Commission in Delhi are checking with local authorities to determine exactly how many Australians may have been caught up in these incidents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The group that has claimed responsibility for this attack calls itself the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Mujahideen" rel="nofollow">
         Deccan Mujahideen
        </a>
        . At this stage little is known of this group, at least those using this name. But whichever group perpetrated this attack they are cowards. It is likely to take some time to identify all the perpetrators. This cowardly attack on India’s stability, peace and democracy reminds all of us that international terrorism is far from defeated and that we must maintain our vigilance. We have to continue to work closely with our allies and partners around the world to defeat terrorism.
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of this attack, we have revised our travel advice for India today. I am advised that the previous advice stated that travellers should exercise a high degree of caution in India because of the high risk of terrorist activity by militant groups. The revised travel advisory advises Australians to avoid travel to Mumbai at this time. We are offering, through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        , assistance with counterterrorism and forensic policing to Indonesian authorities, and we are ready to assist India in any way it needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        This latest attack on Indian peace, stability and democracy reminds us that we must remain vigilant. Terrorism continues to pose a threat around the world and we must resolve afresh to work with our allies and friends around the world to defeat the terrorists who threaten us.

         by leave—These are truly dreadful events that have happened in Mumbai. I note the minister’s statement and of course associate the coalition unreservedly with the sentiments expressing sympathy to those who have been targeted and to their families. All Australians condemn the perpetrators of these cowardly and frightful attacks on innocent civilians in Mumbai, which do demonstrate, I agree with Senator Faulkner in the clearest terms, that terrorist groups are active in

          add our words of hope that no greater death toll or injury toll comes out of this, and in particular we are thinking of those people who may be hostages or the security people who have to confront these murderers now. We certainly wish a speedy recovery for those people who have been injured and extend our condolences to the relatives and friends of those people who have died so needlessly today in Mumbai.
