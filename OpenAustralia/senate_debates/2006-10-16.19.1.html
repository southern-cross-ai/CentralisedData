        My question is to the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Abetz. Will the minister update the Senate on the outcomes of the 13th annual meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in Japan?

         I thank Senator Bernardi for his question and note his very real interest in tuna fishery. I also thank him for the tour that he took me on recently in the

         area. I am very pleased to report that last week Australia achieved a landmark result at the 13th meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, or CC
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBT" rel="nofollow">
          SBT

         , held in Japan. The result was a win for global conservation and a win for the Australian tuna industry. Following serious concerns about potential illegal catch unearthed collectively by the Australian government and industry, the CCSBT was presented with independent evidence confirming an illegal catch of at least 133,000 tonnes since 1994 and possibly 178,000 tonnes since 1985. To put that in perspective, that is worth roughly $4 billion to $5 billion on the first figure or $6 billion to $8 billion on the second figure.
        </p>
        <p>
         After four days of negotiations, the commission agreed to revise catch allocations, which will see Japan’s quota reduced by over 50 per cent and the global total allowable catch reduced from about 14,000 tonnes to 11,810 tonnes, in line with scientific advice. Taiwan and Korea have also agreed to take small voluntary catch reductions. In recognition that Australia played no role in the illegal catch, we will retain our national allocation of 5,265 tonnes for at least three years. I am sure Senator Bernardi would agree with me that that decision will be welcomed by the Port Lincoln tuna fishers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, achieving a reduction in the overall catch means little if appropriate measures are not in place to ensure that the new quotas are adhered to. To that end, I am also pleased to report that the commission accepted a range of Australian proposals to enhance monitoring and compliance in the fishery, including a new catch documentation scheme, compulsory vessel monitoring systems and 100 per cent observer coverage on vessels used to tranship SBT.
        </p>

         place on record my appreciation for the responsible position adopted by the new Japanese government on this important global conservation issue. I am confident that we are entering a new era of cooperation, and the fact that we have been able to maturely address this potentially very divisive issue will only enhance the friendship that exists between the two countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         This decision means many things. It is a major win for global conservation. It is a major shot in the arm for Australia’s $300 million southern bluefin tuna farming industry. It is a just reward for Australian officials, led by Glenn Hurry and his team from my department, who have worked tirelessly to uncover this overcatch and see that not only are its perpetrators subject to appropriate penalties but also it never happens again. At the same time, it also underlines the Australian government’s deserved reputation as a global leader in marine conservation and the fight to stamp out the scourge of illegal fishing. Finally, it is a real wake-up call for those in our community, including the Greens, who seek to ban the Australian harvest of SBT and, by so doing, undermine Australia’s influence in the commission. Put simply, the survival of the SBT is reliant on an effective commission, and this recent decision shows it is working effectively.
