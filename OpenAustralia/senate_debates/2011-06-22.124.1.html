        I have two very specific questions for the Minister representing the Minister for

         Climate Change

        . Could the minister advise the Senate what the reduction in tonnes of carbon in greenhouse gas emissions will be in the first year after the carbon tax is imposed and what is that as a percentage of total world greenhouse gas emissions? Minister, if you say that depends on what the price of carbon is, perhaps you could then tell the Senate what the range is that is being looked at. So, on the range of carbon prices, what is the number of tonnes—two very specific questions—in reduction of carbon in the first year and, secondly, what is that as a percentage of total world greenhouse gas emissions?

         The good senator did anticipate my first response to that, which is that the extent of emission reduction does depend on the price as well as on other factors, including how industry responds and how the economy responds to the challenge of abatement. It is the case that the level of emissions reduction does depend, in large part, on the price. Unsurprisingly, notwithstanding the question from the senator, I am not going to be announcing aspects of a package that is obviously still being worked through by the government and by the members of parliament who do care about this issue. I am simply not going to go through a hypothetical analysis, as I am being invited to.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is clear, notwithstanding the opposition of the opposition, that placing a price on carbon is the most effective way to reduce emissions. It is the cheapest way to reduce emissions. That is why this government tried on a number of previous occasions to get a price on carbon through the Senate. That is why the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, arrived at a position that Australia should put a price on carbon.

          , I have a point of order on relevance. I did not ask the minister about what other governments might have done. I asked two very specific questions: the number of tonnes and, if it depends on a price, the range—which I know the climate change department has been working on or should have been—and what that is as a percentage of world emissions. They are very specific and have nothing to do with what the previous government might or might not have done. I would ask you, Mr President, to tell the minister to answer it or sit down if she cannot.

           , on the point of order: this is a question that was based on a false premise and had a hypothetical thrown in as well. This is a question that was utterly ludicrous. Despite that, Senator Wong has been absolutely discussing the question and responding to it. But when you ask a hypothetical on a hypothetical on a hypothetical it does become a little absurd and it is broad ranging. I would ask you to dismiss this frivolous point of order. Senator Macdonald is just embarrassed that his question was so poor.

I was invited to give a range on the price and I have explained to the chamber why I am not in a position to do that until the government announces its package.

                 I cannot assist the senator with what may or may not be part of the government's announcement, although I have no doubt that when it is made there will be a great many questions asked in this place and the senator will have a substantial amount of opportunity to ask me and other members of the government about these and other issues. On the general issue of transitional assistance, the senator will know that one of the reasons the government in its previous package sought to provide free permits was as transitional assistance, recognising the importance of sensible transitioning of the economy. As we are a Labor government and our focus is first on jobs, we obviously did want to ensure sensible assistance. In terms of the incentive to abate, Senator, I am happy to discuss that in future questions.

I ask the minister if, after almost four years involved in this job, with the resources of a special department of the government to look at these things, her inability now to answer even these basic questions demonstrates that the carbon tax proposed has nothing to do with the environment and everything to do with the Gillard government's debt crisis.

                   That question is from a man who follows a leader who pretends to be a conviction politician while arguing for a plebiscite that he said he would ignore. What sort of conviction politician says, 'I so care about this issue so much the people should decide, but, by the way, I'll ignore it.' That completely exposes both the senator and Mr Abbott for what they are. They are far more interested in playing a short-term political game, trying to be destructive and negative, than acting in the long-term national interest.

                   We on this side understand that the challenge of climate change will not disappear because some people on that side are not prepared to face up to it. We on this side and other members of this parliament are prepared to take that responsibility. It is not an easy policy challenge but it is not one that should continue to be ducked because some people want to play a few political games.

                    , I rise on a point of order. During question time I asked you to rule on an interjection from Senator Joyce. That was shouted out, and it was clearly heard by the member, who did not take offence but had every right to. I ask you to check the

                    </i>

                     Let me just clarify one thing. I did not hear any interjection and I made that quite clear. If it was audible it was certainly not audible to me. I will undertake to check the
