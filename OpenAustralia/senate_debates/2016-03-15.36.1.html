        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to Professor Owler, President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Medical_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Medical Association
        </a>
        , who says that the Abbott-Turnbull government's decision to slash $57 billion from hospitals will translate to fewer services for patients and means that people will wait in emergency departments for unacceptable periods. Is the Australian Medical Association correct?

         I do think that that question sounds rather like the one that was previously asked of me,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         . But, with respect for the senator, I will answer that question again.
        </p>
        <p>
         Firstly, the President of the AMA, Brian Owler, is entitled to his opinions, of course. I do not necessarily agree with him in all instances and I do not agree with him in this instance. The $57 billion that those opposite refer to was fanciful spending. It was never there. Those on the other side had never actually funded it. This crops up from time to time, but it had never actually been funded.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite might choose to ask the question again, and the answer will be exactly the same. This government is increasing funding to hospitals over the forward estimates. I will say that again, just in case those opposite did not catch it the first time: this government will be increasing funding to hospitals over the forward estimates—every single year. Indeed, when we look at all of the states they all increase. The total increase in annual funding, 2014-15 to 2018-19—those opposite might like to listen—increases in every single state and territory.
        </p>
        <p>
         So rather than what those opposite claim—that there is a decrease in funding—we are increasing funding to hospitals, year-on-year. They, on the other side, have not funded any of their promises when it comes to health.

           Australian Medical Association
          </a>
          , which says that as a result of these cuts, as hospital capacity shrinks doctors will not be able to get their patients into hospital or keep them there to receive the critical care they deserve. Is the Australian Medical Association correct?

           If the senator had listened to the answer to the first question he may have been able to slightly adjust his second question. There are no cuts. There are increases to the public hospital funding system over the forward estimates every year. As I have said, the President of the AMA is quite entitled to his opinion, but I disagree with the premise that the senator has put forward that there are cuts.

             My answer, quite obviously, is: this minister. Indeed, this government is making very sensible, measured decisions about funding not only related to health but right across all portfolio areas when it comes to a sustainable future for this country. We on this side of the chamber do not believe it is appropriate, like those opposite in the Labor Party do, to do policy on the run, to have ill-thought-through policy that is not costed and not funded. We actually do not think that that is appropriate. We think that responsible governments make economic decisions that are balanced and measured, and we will continue to do that. We will also continue, as I have stated several times now, to increase hospital funding over the forward estimates every single year. We will continue to make those sensible decisions for the benefit of the Australian people.
