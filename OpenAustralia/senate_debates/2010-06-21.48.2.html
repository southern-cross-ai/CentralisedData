        I seek the indulgence of the chamber. Unfortunately I was not in the chamber when my report was tabled, but I seek leave to make some comments rather than incorporate my speech if that is possible.

        This report addresses five major works, spread across four states and territories, with a total estimated cost of over $240 million. In every case the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives agree to the works proceeding.
       </p>

        The works in this report are:the construction of a Centre for Accelerator Science, and extensions to the

        Turning first to Defence Housing Australia, the committee inquired into two projects that will provide new houses for members of the ADF. They will also provide new vacant building lots for private homes, and the committee commends
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHA" rel="nofollow">
         DHA
        </a>
        for helping to address the shortage of residential land in Australian cities. I commend DHA for the work that they have done in developing far more appropriate tropical housing for defence families coming into
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        . They have developed what they call their ‘troppo house’, which is designed for tropical Australia and will actively promote sustainable building skills in the Darwin trades. The committee commends this approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee is still concerned, though, by DHA’s approach to housing for people with disabilities. The report discusses how DHA can reverse the unfounded perception that such housing is inferior or substandard. Indeed, such housing is very valuable and is highly desirable because it breaks down physical barriers within homes and can be very aesthetically pleasing. While only a small percentage of defence personnel directly require accessible housing, DHA should be considering building housing that is appropriate for the entire life cycle, including allowing elderly family members to visit, for example. I do acknowledge the challenge placed in front of DHA in that when constructing appropriate housing for tropical climates it can be very difficult to make this housing accessible simply because of the need to build those houses on high blocks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee also considered an office fit-out for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Climate_Change_and_Energy_Efficiency" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency
        </a>
        in Canberra. While the committee was not inquiring into the building in which the department will be housed, many submissions to the inquiry did concern the heritage and visual impacts that the building may have. The committee thanks those submitters for their contribution to the inquiry and encourages the department to continue liaising with a number of eminent people from the Canberra region who took the time to make their thoughts known. Regarding the fit-out itself, the committee is very pleased by the considerable energy-saving and environmentally sustainable features. The committee commends the department for securing a fit-out that will be at the leading edge of office accommodation in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee also considered two science projects—and it is terrific that the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, is actually with us at the moment. Each will make a significant contribution to Australia’s research activities across an impressive range of fields. In the case of the Pawsey centre, CSIRO is proposing to create a supercomputer facility in Perth. It would be available for the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope if Australia is chosen, and in any case will be available to scientists for research across Australia on a merit basis. As for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSTO" rel="nofollow">
         ANSTO
        </a>
        , the new Centre for Accelerator Science will significantly boost Australia’s research capacity and build on ANSTO’s specialised expertise in particle accelerators. The committee was again impressed by the diverse array of research that uses, particularly, the particle accelerator science, and the committee commends ANSTO for its recent implementation of a 45-year plan to ensure sound strategic planning.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report traverses varied ground and the committee thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to inspect the varied projects being undertaken by various Commonwealth agencies. I would note that the committee has discussed some areas needing improvement from submitting agencies, particularly risk management and costings. On this subject, I remind agencies that the committee has recently updated its manual of procedures and I strongly encourage all agencies to consult it as soon as possible so as to be up to speed with the details that the committee now expects in its submissions. Finally, I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries and I commend the report to the Senate.
