        O'NEILL () (): I'm going to put on the record a speech by Deena Clemson, from my duty electorate of Lyne, which I'm reading as part of the Raise Our Voice Australia campaign. Congratulations, Deena.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Imagine this: gardens on the rooftops of every building, a fresh breeze blowing against your face while you move through the shadows cast by overhanging trees and a feeling of connection with yourself and with the planet—a clean, green society.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Deena Clemson, I'm 14 years old and I live in the Lyne electorate, on the land of the Warrimay people. A sustainable lifestyle, living in harmony with both yourself and the planet, being able to understand and care for the magnificent potential that this planet holds—this is the future I'm fighting for. We have a colossal impact on the planet, which has detrimental repercussions on everyone. One change that Australia should make to become a better place for future generations is simply understanding and implementing a sustainable lifestyle—small changes made in everyone's lives, like composting, buying locally, recycling and changing to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED" rel="nofollow">

        light bulbs. Vincent van Gogh said, 'Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.' If we all make small changes, we can make a huge difference.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But how does Australia get there? The Australian government needs to provide an education on how to properly recycle and live in harmony with the planet. They need to lead by example. So, if you take one thing away from this today, I ask you to remember this: let's learn—learn to implement, learn to share and learn to preserve.

         Today I'm reading out a speech from Senuthi Jayasinghe, a young person from

         </a>
         . This is part of the Raise Our Voice in Parliament campaign, which amplifies the voices of young people and their visions for the future. The speech is titled 'A simpler solution to Australia's gambling problem'.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A gambler is someone who relies on false hope to make a living. It's already 2023, and Australia has still found itself with the highest per capita gambling loss.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         More than 30,000 citizens throughout Australia are becoming dependent on gambling, with countless others teetering on the edge. With slot machines on every corner, more than half the world's slot machines are located here in Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The persistence of this gambling epidemic is due to the lack of education, support, and discouragement from the government.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is crucial for the government to implement stricter regulations, provide more resources for addiction support, and educate the public about the dangers of gambling addiction.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Only through these measures can we hope to address the underlying causes of the problem and assist those affected by it.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The government should also consider implementing stricter advertising regulations to prevent the glamorization of gambling and reduce its accessibility.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Additionally, establishing a national helpline and support network for gambling addiction would offer much-needed assistance to those grappling with this issue.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         By taking these steps, Australia can work towards reducing the prevalence of gambling addiction and promoting a healthier society.

         echo these solutions. We call for a regulator and a ban on gambling advertising and political donations from the industry. Thank you, Senuthi, for this wonderful speech drawing our attention to such an important and systemic issue affecting the lives of so many Australians.
