         The Prime Minister agrees that we need to do everything to bring down electricity prices and ensure Australians can benefit from reliable energy supplies, and that is precisely what the government is doing. I'm quite happy to take you back through the four key parts of our plan: a price safety net, stopping price gouging, backing investment in reliable power, supporting 24/7 reliable power. There are, of course, many components to it, and we invite the Labor Party to join the coalition in working hard to bring electricity prices down.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first thing that the Labor Party could do, here and now, is rule out the reintroduction of a carbon tax. The other day, earlier this week, we had the shadow Attorney-General being asked whether he could rule out a carbon tax, and what did he say? He said something. He said, 'I'm not going to play the rule in, rule out game.' At least—

           On direct relevance. I clearly simply asked the minister whether the Prime Minister agreed with the comments of Innes Willox? I can repeat those comments again if you'd like, but that is all I asked.

             . I think that I very directly addressed what the Prime Minister agreed with, and that is our plan to bring electricity prices down and to ensure that Australians can benefit from reliable energy supplies. Of course, I understand why a Labor senator would jump up when I start talking about Labor's plans for a carbon tax, though I was surprised that Senator Marshall was so quick in jumping up to defend the shadow Attorney-General. I didn't know that they were part of the same dysfunctional Labor family in Victoria. We hear a lot from the Labor Party—

                    Ms Westacott is an outstanding Australian. I've got a lot of time for Ms Westacott, who does a great job as the

                    . One of the missions that Jennifer Westacott has pursued in recent years is a lower and globally more competitive tax rate for businesses in Australia. So I assume, now that Senator Marshall is a fan of the

                    and is promoting the arguments put forward by the BCA, that Senator Marshall is now going to advocate for a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate.

                      . I know that he's a right-wing free marketeer from way back. Nothing surprises me about the Victorian Labor Party anymore. Maybe that is a rearguard action by Senator Marshall to switch courses.

                         The Prime Minister will continue to do what we've done as a government over the last five years, and that is to make decisions to put the Australian economy on a stronger foundation and trajectory for the future, to create more jobs and indeed to get the budget back into surplus as soon as possible while bringing electricity prices down by making sure that we've got reliable energy supplies into the future. We know that Labor governments around Australia in the past, most famously the Labor government in
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                          South Australia
                         </a>
                         , have failed to keep the lights on in their state jurisdictions. We know that Labor governments in the past, having promised, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' have then turned around to push up electricity prices in a way that hurt the economy, put jobs at risk and hurt the opportunity for families around Australia to get ahead. Under our government, you will get a continuation of stronger growth, more jobs, a stronger and improving budget position, lower electricity prices and more reliable energy supplies. That will be the choice before the Australian people at the next election.
