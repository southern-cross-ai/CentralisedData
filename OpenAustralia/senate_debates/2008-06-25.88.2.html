           <dd>
            (i)   Australia is the only country, apart from the United States of America, to have introduced a global gag rule in its aid program through the AusAID family planning guidelines that restricts contraception options and prohibits the use of aid funding for anything related to abortion, such as training of medical personnel in safe abortion, or providing information or warnings about unsafe abortion,
