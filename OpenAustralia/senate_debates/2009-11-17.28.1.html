         Green Building Council

         Forest Stewardship Council

         I will have to take further advice on this, Senator Brown. I am not aware of the proposition that you have put to the chamber. If you are talking about the Australian Building Ministers Forum, which met last Friday and which I chaired, then the events that you have outlined are simply not true.
