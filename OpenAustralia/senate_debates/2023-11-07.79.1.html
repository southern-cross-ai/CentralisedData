        examsâ€”their final exams after a long career in the school system. I want to acknowledge that this is a really stressful time. Take a breath, remember all the hard work you've put in and just do your best. This is a difficult time, but it is a time when you can look forward to some lengthy downtime once these exams are finished. Good luck to all of you.

        In the Labor government, we know that the education you get is really important, and that requires us to make sure that, across the country, we have the best teachers possible to ensure that you get the world-class education you deserve. That's why we've announced that for students who are commencing teaching degrees in 2024 there are now scholarships available for up to $40,000 to encourage more people to become teachers. The scholarships will be available for undergraduate students, and $20,000 will be available for postgraduate students. This scholarship will encourage more teachers to live and work in rural and regional areas. We're hoping to see a lot of people sign up and get on board. Teaching is an excellent profession. The views of the students you teach will stay with you for the rest of your life, and they will remember you and the dedication that you have to their education. So, if you are thinking about a career in education, please sign up for one of the scholarships. And, if you're taking your exams in the next two weeks, the best of best of luck to you.
