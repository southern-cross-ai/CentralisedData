        My question is to Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Yesterday the minister refused to repudiate the disgraceful comments made by Labor Senator Crossin in relation to the number of children saved from sexual abuse by the coalition’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        intervention on the grounds that he had not seen the senator’s comments. Has the minister now reviewed Senator Crossin’s disgraceful comments including her latest and more extreme contribution where she now asserts that the disturbing
        <i>
         Little children are sacred
        </i>
        report never had anything to do with the intervention in the Northern Territory? Will the minister now do the decent thing and repudiate the claims made by Senator Crossin?

         I think it is disappointing that Senator Scullion has again pursued this issue in this way. As I said to him yesterday, there has been bipartisan support for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         intervention. Despite some misgivings we had about some of the detail at the time, the now Prime Minister immediately supported the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard, in the intervention and provided bipartisan support.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also seen in recent times the apology to the stolen generation which, again, engendered bipartisan support. My view was that there was an emerging consensus in politics in this country of the need to have a bipartisan approach to Indigenous affairs. Successive governments on both sides have failed to properly support Indigenous people so that we have these terrible issues that blight Indigenous communities and the terrible figures on health and life expectancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the debate the other night, I have looked at what Senator Crossin said and I think you have to put all her comments in context. I also understand that Senator Crossin issued a statement yesterday clarifying her position. She apologised if anyone construed her remarks to suggest that all instances of child sex abuse and neglect are not matters of the greatest significance. She restated her view that child sexual assault is completely unacceptable and must not be tolerated.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said through you,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , to Senator Scullion yesterday, I think that is the view of all senators around this chamber and I think it does not help anyone to have people accuse others of, in some way, supporting child sex abuse. It is an area where there has been unanimous support around the parliament in a range of committees and inquiries to try and better protect children in our community. Senator Crossin has been at the forefront of those efforts, advocating for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and for Aboriginal children. I reject some of the accusations made in the senator’s question—

          <p>
           I am trying to be generous, Senator Abetz. I think it is a politically motivated attack rather than a serious debate about the needs of the Indigenous children. I restate that the Rudd Labor government has committed to the implementation of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           intervention. It has continued the initiative of the former government. It has sought to continue to have bipartisan support for that approach.
          </p>
          <p>
           I actually think we can make progress in Indigenous affairs but only if we have bipartisan support. I do not think any government of either persuasion can attack these issues unless it has the support of all political parties, the support of the community and I think, as importantly, the support of business because what we have learned over the years is that government on its own is not going to address these issues however well intentioned.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is more than appropriate that senators can debate the evidence of the Northern Territory intervention. As I understand it the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, will be doing a 12-month review of the intervention. We will get a much better handle on the progress, the impact and the results. We had some of those presented to us at the Senate estimates hearings. I am not sure whether you were there, Senator Scullion; I was there at the time and Senator Crossin, I think, was also there. There was some evidence about what was working and what was not working in terms of the intervention, but the 12-month review will provide us with better evidence as to how we take forward the intervention. I think Senator Crossin has apologised for her remarks appropriately.

             Leader of the Government in the Senate
            </a>
            when given the opportunity to repudiate those remarks, to make absolutely clear the government’s support of the intervention, has let that pass. Perhaps I should ask again. After the senator made these inappropriate remarks, she then went on to take note of answers and in fact made even more outrageous remarks in the same area. In the context of any apology that has simply been offered, we want an explanation from the Leader of the Government in the Senate as to exactly why he will not repudiate the remarks of the senator.

             I thank the senator for the supplementary question. What I have said is that I think Senator Scullion seeks to misconstrue what Senator Crossin said. If he looks to the statement which she issued last night, she sought to clarify those remarks and as part of that she apologised if her remarks had been construed to suggest that all incidences of child sexual abuse and neglect are not matters of the greatest significance. That is the government’s view; I think it is the view of every senator in this place. I do not think playing
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
              Northern Territory
             </a>
             politics with these issues is helpful. The Rudd Labor government continues to support the intervention financially and with all the political effort we can bring to it. I hope that it will deliver results for Indigenous children and the broader Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory.
