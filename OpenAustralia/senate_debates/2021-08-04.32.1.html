        There will be no family home on a block of land in the future, according to the Greens, Labor, the Liberal Party and their sellout sidekicks, the Nationals—not even a 500-, 400- or 300-square-metre block on which to raise a family. The next generation will lose access to land entirely. Town planning now is based on everyday Australians being herded into expensive housing bands located away from the elitist inner-city bubble. This shepherding together is designed to feed massive new urban rail networks to bring workers—or, more accurately, feudal serfs—into central business districts. Once workers, or serfs, catch the train home, inner cities become ghost towns filled with expensive restaurants and rats. Cars are being phased out right now. New housing precincts do not have roads wide enough for two cars to pass. They're being designed for a world where workers do not own cars. Proposed building codes include five storeys with no lift, lower ceilings, thinner walls, narrower corridors, towers built to the four corners of the block and zero green space. Although land is an asset that lasts for ever, a cheap and nasty home unit lasts as long as the building does, and then owners have nothing.

        , Labor and Liberal-Nationals say this is all that working Australians deserve. The Morrison government is pumping up house prices to force young families into tiny and expensive housing. How do parents raise happy, healthy children in a tiny unit in a tower that's home to 20 other families on a block of land that used to house one family?

         One Nation
        </a>
        rejects this dystopian future, this future of human misery, squalor, oppression, disease and overcrowding. One Nation policies will ensure sensible population growth, the building of water and energy capacity and the revival of manufacturing, for a life worth living for all Australians. We will not be divided. We have one flag. We are one community. We are one nation.
