         Currently no offers have been made in relation to the above locations. Final processing of Round Four applications will be completed as soon as possible, subject to state and territory agreement.

         The National Rental Affordability Scheme has the flexibility to stimulate the supply of affordable rental dwellings in regions that are experiencing very high rental costs, such as mining regions.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To improve the financial viability of NRAS dwellings in these regions, a range of different dwelling types are supported by the Scheme. These include studio apartments, townhouses, traditional houses and dual key dwelling, provided they are suitable for independent living, which includes tenants having access to their own bathroom and kitchen facilities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All National Rental Affordability Scheme dwellings are required to comply with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Code" rel="nofollow">
          Building Code
         </a>
         of Australia standards. Approved participants must ensure that each dwelling complies at all times with the landlord, tenancy, building and health and safety laws of the state or territory and local government area in which the dwelling is located.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The application criteria also gives consideration for proposals that maximise affordable housing outcomes for tenants, including building and design features that reduce the overall costs to tenants. This includes building and design features, energy and water saving measures and special window or floor treatments to reduce heat/cold loss. The energy rating of the dwelling and the extent to which the dwelling incorporates efficient lighting, environmentally friendly hot water systems, ventilation and water tanks are assessed for each proposal.
