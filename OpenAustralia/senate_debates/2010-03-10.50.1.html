           The Australian government does not support this motion. As has been stated on previous occasions, the government objects to using formal motions to deal with complex international matters, particularly those involving other governments. However, for the record, I would like to make some points on the government’s position on Tibet. Australia recognises Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. However, we have continuing concerns over the human rights situation in Tibet, including constraints on freedom of expression and cultural and religious rights and the use of capital punishment. The Australian government closely monitors the human rights situation in Tibet and raises its concerns directly with China at various levels, including exchanges between political leaders and senior officials, the annual bilateral human rights dialogue and diplomatic channels. We also raise individual cases of concern with the Chinese authorities.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government supports direct negotiation between representatives of his Holiness the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
            Dalai Lama
           </a>
           and the Chinese government. We were disappointed that the ninth round of negotiations, which took place in Beijing in February, did not make progress. However, we note that both sides are willing to hold further talks. The government will of course continue to monitor the progress of those talks closely. However, we do not intend to provide a running commentary on a particular position taken by one side or the other in the negotiating process. Since the two parties are dealing directly with each other, we do not see any value in multilateral initiatives that seek to apply external pressure on the process. I thank the Senate.

              I just want to draw the attention of senators to the motion, No. 721 on the
              <i>
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_Paper" rel="nofollow">
                Notice Paper
               </a>
              </i>
              . You might like to have a quick look at what it is you are about to vote down, which I presume is what is about to occur. This motion does not actually call on the government to do anything except note the facts of the situation on the ground. I acknowledge that the previous motion, on Burma, actually did call on the Australian government to undertake some significant and quite important changes in Australian foreign policy on that matter. This one does not. It asks the government, in fact, to do exactly what the minister just said, in his exact words: to continue to monitor the progress of talks between the Chinese government and representatives of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
               Dalai Lama
              </a>
              , and other similar clauses. You are about to vote down something that is so innocuous I was almost embarrassed to put it up. This is not about delicate matters of foreign policy, and yet the entire chamber seems, on instinct, prepared to simply line up and knock it off. This is a long way—

                  I will take that interjection from Senator Milne because I have absolutely no doubt that there is a lot of support in this chamber for the aspirations of the

                  . A number of us here have had the honour of meeting the Dalai Lama or his representatives in Australia at different times—but don’t come out and do that and then vote down something that effectively calls on the Senate to note the facts on the ground, which is really all we are doing here today. It is an awful shame that the major parties will vote it down. I just ask you to read the motion. I know that does not always happen; we are all busy people. Just read what it is you are about to vote down. I would greatly appreciate that.
