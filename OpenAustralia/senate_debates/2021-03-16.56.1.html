        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Minister Colbeck. Spain, Germany, France, Cyprus, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands and Ireland have hit pause on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
         AstraZeneca

        rollout while they look into its potential links to blood clots. Your colleague Senator Canavan said today that Australia should follow suit. Why is the minister for health telling Australians there's no need to worry when health officials in eight different countries are putting on the brakes?

         Thanks, Senator Lambie, for the question. As I said earlier in question time today, the government continues to follow the advice of Australia's world-leading
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
          Therapeutic Goods Administration
         </a>
         and of the other health authorities that advise us and have advised us so successfully through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this circumstance, ATAGI, who provide advice to us, has put out a statement noting the suspension of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
          AstraZeneca
         </a>
         rollout in other countries, but it has also noted, as part of that statement, that the rates of thrombotic events are not higher in the vaccine recipients than the expected background rate. These events are an issue that health authorities keep an eye on as part of the process, and our authorities here in Australia maintain and continue close contact with authorities in Europe, particularly the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMA" rel="nofollow">
          EMA
         </a>
         , and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         authority, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHRA" rel="nofollow">
          MHRA
         </a>
         , where over 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been dispensed without seeing an incidence of increase of these sorts of events.
        </p>
        <p>
         We maintain close contact with those authorities, and the government continues to act on the advice of the TGA, ATAGI and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Medical Officer
         </a>
         , Professor Kelly, in continuing a safe rollout of this vaccine across the country, which we all acknowledge is extremely important for not only the health of the Australian community but also the economic recovery of the Australian economy from the COVID-19 virus. We continue to act on that professional advice, and that's the advice that we will follow as the rollout continues. The government believes that that's the appropriate process to follow.

           This isn't just about science; this is about trust. Australians didn't trust the minister for health enough to sign up to the COVIDSafe app. He spent $14 million on that app, and half of that was on advertising. A year later, it's only found a handful of COVID contacts. If Australians didn't trust the health minister enough to put an app on their phones, why would they trust him enough to put a vaccine in their arms?

              People in this building can deny it until they're blue in the face, but the reality is that, out there, there's growing lack of trust in the vaccine. People are saying that they're losing confidence that the vaccines we have in Australia are safe and effective. Why have we tied the fate of our economic recovery to the success of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">

               I thank Senator Lambie for the question, but I don't agree with the assertion she placed at the end of her question. The vaccination process in this country is continuing to ramp up. We are continuing to receive supplies of both the Pfizer and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
                AstraZeneca
               </a>
               vaccines. Other vaccines may come online to support the vaccination of Australians as the approval process continues, as we get access, say, through the Covax mechanism, where we do have capacity coming online.
              </p>
              <p>
               Australians can be confident. I have to say that, in my experience and in the feedback that I've been getting, for example, from aged-care facilities, there is significant confidence and significant demand. There is significant demand from senior Australians for the vaccination process—
