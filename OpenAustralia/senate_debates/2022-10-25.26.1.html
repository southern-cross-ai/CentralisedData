        In our jobs as senators we often encounter the most extraordinary Australians quietly delivering amazing things for their communities. Today I'd like to acknowledge the work of Claire Hunt, the Defence School Mentor at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Bay_College" rel="nofollow">
         Comet Bay College
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Secret Harbour
        </a>
        , just south of Perth. She is a true local hero. For the past 13 years Claire has coordinated the Defence School Mentor Program to support the many students at the school who have parents or guardians serving in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . Under her leadership the HaSS school at Comet Bay has created an extraordinary service museum in the corridors of the school. I've never seen anything quite like it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I had the opportunity to sit down with Claire for an interview for Comet Bay College's new mobile augmented reality application, Anzac Heroes, for which they received $118,000 from the Morrison government's Saluting Their Service Commemorative Grants program. This groundbreaking initiative is bringing to life the stories of some of our nation's Anzac heroes, those well-known, those not so well-known and those local. The use of augmented technology will take students, parents and the public back in time to some iconic moments in Australia's military history. I was so honoured to have shared my own story of 35 years service in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army Reserve
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This commemorative war museum has been lovingly brought to life with the stories not only of individual servicemen but also, pleasingly, so many service women. It is so important for the next generation not only to appreciate those who have and those who continue to serve but also to understand the lessons of war. Congratulations, Claire. You are a true local hero and you are an inspiration.
