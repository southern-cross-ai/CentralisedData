        Yesterday in this place there was a discussion in relation to global Magnitsky laws. I think it is incredibly important that whenever we discuss these laws we remember and pay tribute to the man who inspired them,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky" rel="nofollow">
         Sergei Magnitsky
        </a>
        . Sergei Magnitsky was a son, a husband and a father, a man who uncovered a $230 million corruption and fraud scandal in Russia. He spent 11 months in jail without trial. Only eight days before he was required to be released, he died in prison at the age of 37. So, when we talk about the global Magnitsky laws, let's always remember the man who inspired them and the story of his sacrifice. Let's remember the words of his family. When Sergei was nominated for the Allard Prize, this is what they said about their husband and father:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sergei was so outraged by the theft of $230 million dollars of taxes which should have gone to state recipients like pensioners, schools, the disabled, and hospitals, that he stood up in the belief that truth and justice would prevail. Others might have backed down in the face of the immense pressure he was subjected to, but he did not. That would have meant compromising his own integrity and sense of honesty and he could never do that. He believed that he was acting for the greater good of his country and fellow citizens. He wanted to be a shining example to his colleagues, friends and family.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, whenever we talk about the global Magnitsky laws, let's always remember the tale of Sergei Magnitsky and his sacrifice.
