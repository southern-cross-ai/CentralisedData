How are these clinics helping Australians access affordable health care when they need it? And how are they helping to alleviate pressure on hospital emergency departments?

         It is so great to get a question about the health system from you, Senator Polley. I appreciate it and all the work that you do, particularly on the community affairs committee and others—we have spent a lot of time together in recent years—and for your interest in health, the Tasmanian health system in particular.
        </p>

         At the last election we promised to establish Medicare urgent care clinics and we are delivering on that promise. The first of 58 Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia are opening their doors and already helping Australians get timely and affordable access to the health care they need. We have committed funding over five years to establish these Medicare urgent care clinics. It is a new approach to providing care for people who require medical treatment urgently but do not need an ambulance or hospital stay. The urgent care clinics provide another option for people to seek the medical care that they need. They are open extended hours, seven days a week, and many of these clinics are being established in existing general practice and community health centres to make best use of existing facilities and leveraging the existing workforce. All of the services provided by Medicare urgent care clinics are bulk-billed.

           I can hear Senator Henderson. She does not like urgent care clinics, does not like people being able to access health care. I know I should not respond to interjections but Senator Henderson is such a serial offender. These are highly popular models of care. Highly trained doctors and nurses provide care at the Medicare urgent care clinics with no need for an appointment—again, very convenient for busy families on the go. Urgent care clinics deliver service from the time people walk in right through to addressing the health issues so they can leave without putting pressure on the emergency departments. Last week in Tasmania, the Prime Minister officially open the Medicare urgent care clinic at Your Hobart Doctor on

           . In its first two weeks, Senator Polley, it has seen 400 patients.

               GP
              </a>
              s and hospital emergency departments. By working closely with states and territories, we are ensuring that the services provided by these clinics are responsive to the needs of local communities, and we're working with GPs and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHN" rel="nofollow">
               PHN
              </a>
              s to ensure the urgent care clinics are set up to deliver the end-to-end care that they need from these clinics. By working to ensure the quality of services provided by urgent care clinics, we will help ease the pressure on hospital emergency departments, and we know that we need to relieve this pressure—it's what the states and territories are telling us, and it's what anyone who has tried to use an emergency department will know.

              s are for semi-urgent or non-urgent conditions that are better off treated in these urgent care clinics. We look forward to seeing them develop in the next few months.

                 Thank you very much, Senator Polley, again for your interest in health care, because we know those opposite weren't interested when they were in government, and they're certainly not interested now. The government is determined to strengthen Australia's health system after a decade of neglect, and this government has been pursuing priorities through National Cabinet by working with states and territories. Remember that the former government never really were able to work with states and territories but liked to pick fights with them? We're working with states and territories to make sure that these urgent care clinics can be delivered in a seamless way, that they're integrated, that they support general practice, that they work with the hospital system and, most importantly, that people who need to access health care out of hours—on the weekend, when their kids get sick or break their arm and there aren't any other options available—can do so. This government is backing you by funding urgent care clinics to make sure that they are available to meet your health needs.
