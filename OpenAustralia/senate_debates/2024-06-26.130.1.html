        Thank you, Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan. I don't know about you, but I am sick of being told Australia is a racist country. Let me tell you, when it comes to the subject of racism in this country, you're being gaslit—gaslit by the government, gaslit by the Public Service and gaslit by the corporate sector. These days it's impossible to get through 24 hours without being bombarded by claims of systemic racism, the dangers of colonialism or the media reporting on oppression. Yet, when I walk out on the street, all I see is a good society, a harmonious society, a country where people get along, perhaps better than any other place in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        In truth, Australia is recognised as one of the most tolerant nations on the planet. In fact, according to the website World Population Review, Australia is the 12th highest-ranked country in the world for racial harmony. Translated, that means Australia is demonstrably welcoming of people of different races. And if you compare and contrast that with countries like India, where the caste system bricks in hierarchies of power that set the presumed supremacy of one group of people against the supposed inferiority of another, you start to get the picture. Or compare it with China, which actively discriminates and incarcerates the Uyghur people. Yet here in Australia, a place where there is no such calamity, all we hear about from our cultural elites is how we should feel ashamed of our culture and how we should erase our history. Why? It's all about division, of course. Divided, we're weak and susceptible to the cultural left. Remember the Voice to Parliament? They're egging this narrative on and causing us to fight among ourselves, because the cultural left are dedicated to overthrowing the status quo.

       <p>
        Generations of students have now left school convinced about the impending destruction caused by so-called 'man-made global boiling' and that gender is a social construct or that Western civilisation is rife with sexism, racism and xenophobia. In short, Marx has been dead for well over a century, but his poisoned ideology lives on. Drill into any leftist movement, be it rampant environmentalism, critical race theory, the expansion of the welfare state or D&amp;I offices in every major corporation, and you'll find Marxism at its core. These movements are all about using a guilt trip as a way of convincing us to hurt ourselves. The myth of rampant Aussie racism is just that—it's a myth. It's nothing more than a political sleight of hand, designed to do what this ideology does—divide us up into the role of oppressor and oppressed. That's why, every single day, Australians who have nothing to do with the wrongdoings of the past are made to feel guilty and ashamed.
       </p>
       <p>
        These arbiters of good behaviour aren't brave. They're not kind. They're some of the worst people in the country—maybe the world. They've never actually helped anyone. They're the people in our society who preach tolerance but yell at those with whom they disagree. They're those of the hyphenated-name brigade who claim to speak for the worker yet yell at supermarket cashiers when they don't scan their vegan sausages carefully enough. They're the ones who talk about world peace, only to happily enter into mortal combat with a neighbour if they leave their sprinkler on for ten minutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        These people will try and tell us things which are demonstrably not true. Why? Because it serves their purpose. Politics in this country has got to drown out this noisy minority. It's got to stop being spooked by the perception of a narrative which barely exists. Racism isn't on the rise in this country, but socialism certainly is. My message to the media, the bureaucrats and the government is to stop lying and start telling the truth.
