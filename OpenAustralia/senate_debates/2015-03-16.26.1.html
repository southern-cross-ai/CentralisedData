         Thank you very much, Senator Mason, for your continued interest in this very difficult issue. The government and all members of parliament remain deeply concerned about the situation. As honourable senators would be aware, on 4 March, Chan and Sukumaran were transferred to the jail in the Nusakambangan complex in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Java" rel="nofollow">

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         officials have facilitated visits to the two men by their families. The Prime Minister has also spoken by telephone with the families of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following the decision of the State Administrative Court of Indonesia about the rejection of a clemency plea, lawyers for the two men lodged an appeal against this decision on 2 March, which is currently pending. There are currently two legal avenues underway. First is the appeal against the final rejection of the clemency plea. There are also judicial commission hearings underway in relation to allegations of bribery and corruption at the original trial of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran.
        </p>
        <p>
         The state administrative court will hear the appeal—that is, the first of the two avenues to which I referred—on 19 March, later this week. The

          Foreign Minister
         </a>
         has advised that it is her understanding that further plans for the executions would not proceed while those legal options are being pursued. And, indeed, as well as that the government through the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, myself, the Minister for Justice and senior officials have entreated the Indonesian government on many occasions now to spare the lives of these two Australians.

           I mentioned, in response to the primary question, the many entreaties on behalf of by the Prime Minister and senior ministers. One of my representations to the Indonesian government was to the Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, Mr Purdijatno. Last Friday I received a response to my letter to Minister Purdijatno. The minister acknowledged the Australian government's rising concern. However, I am afraid I must inform the Senate that the letter was discouraging. It confirmed the Indonesian government's commitment to enforcing its national laws, which we understand to be a reaffirmation of the current intention of the Indonesian government to proceed with the executions.

             All members of this parliament have been immensely helpful in supporting the government's entreaties to the government of Indonesia, and I have in mind most particularly the unanimous resolution of the House of Representatives passed with bipartisan support on 11 February this year. I cannot stress enough the absolute criticality that the Australian parliament continue to speak with one voice. I cannot emphasise enough the absolute criticality of all members of the Australian parliament putting to one side any considerations of political advantage and supporting to the utmost and in a clear voice the Australian government's entreaties on behalf of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran.
