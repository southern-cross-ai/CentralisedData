          Thanks, President. The China Stone mine is now moving ahead. The Adani mine would suck 12½ billion litres of water from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suttor_River" rel="nofollow">
           Suttor River
          </a>
          and up to six gigalitres of groundwater in a region already crippled by drought. The China Stone mine is expected to need about as much water, so, if both mines were to proceed, it would double the take of surface and groundwater. If both mines proceeded, they would use twice as much as all other users of the Suttor River combined. This region is crippled by drought. Fifty-eight per cent of Queensland is crippled by drought. Will the minister finally stand up for our environment and our precious water and reject this new water-hungry mega thermal coalmine?

           Before I call the minister to answer the question, statements of fact are allowed as long as they are strictly relevant to the question. I encourage senators to remember that when they're phrasing their questions. I call the minister: Senator Birmingham, representing the Minister for the Environment.

            I thank Senator Waters for her question, although I do not necessarily accept, on face value, a number of the claims and assertions that were made by Senator Waters during that question. I do, however, acknowledge that Senator Waters indicated that parts of Queensland, parts of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            , parts of Australia are doing it tough from drought conditions at present. Parts of Australia are doing it tough in terms of not experiencing or getting the benefits of the economic growth that Australia overall is enjoying. That, of course, is one of the reasons why the coalition government firmly welcomes proposals that create investment in jobs and opportunities in regional Australia. We want to see regional Australia get the benefits of investments across a whole range of different industries.

            In relation to the China Stone coalmine project that my colleague Senator Canavan was just discussing, it is correct that a proposal for this mine, adjacent to another proposal for the Carmichael coalmine, has been put forward. The mine is undergoing a comprehensive assessment for its impacts on listed threatened species and water resources, which I know were a feature of Senator Waters' question, as is required by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">

            Act. The Queensland Coordinator-General released their evaluation report on the environmental impact statement on 22 November 2018. The Coordinator-General's report will also be used as an approval decision under the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
             EPBC Act
            </a>
            , under the standard accredited assessment processes. The Department of the Environment and Energy is now reviewing the evaluation report to prepare a recommendation on whether or not approval for the proposal should also be granted under the EPBC Act. This decision is due on 29 January and will, of course, receive all of the usual thorough expert advice to inform its decision-making. Our government makes sure that we apply strict and robust environmental conditions, but we also work to ensure that projects can be facilitated wherever possible to ensure that communities get the job and investment opportunities they deserve.

              If it were approved, the China Stone mine would export 38 million tonnes of coal annually, so, over the life of the mine, that one mine would produce the same as 10 years of Australia's domestic emissions. It is a climate bomb. Has the minister read the

               The only ones blinded in this place are, of course, the Greens sitting in that corner over there, who would shut down all resources projects and all mining projects and who would stand against all investment wherever they could. The real threat to Australia is, of course, that, should there be a future Labor government again beholden to the Greens, we know full well that, when push comes to shove, a future Labor government would bow to the wishes of the Greens and would block investment projects, the types of projects that can create jobs and prosperity for regional Australia.

              <p>
               When it comes to global emissions, our government makes commitments on behalf of Australia and delivers upon them. We have made commitments to work to ensure that, in relation to Australia's 2020 emissions targets, we will not only meet them but exceed them. We will exceed them by a projected 300 million tonnes. We'll do that while still seeing increased investment across the nation. In terms of that investment, we want to see jobs. We're unashamed about supporting jobs. We'll keep supporting jobs.

                   Because I like to be helpful to the extent that I possibly can, I'll take those questions on notice and see whether we can provide or furnish the senator with information in that regard. It's not in my portfolio or the portfolio that I represent, but 'not to my knowledge' is the answer there.

                   But, of course, what we see in relation to these projects is millions of dollars being invested by the private sector in developing employment and investment opportunities in regional areas of Australia, and that's to be welcomed. As a government, we're proud of the fact that our work as a government to create the economic climate for more investment in regional Australia is creating more job opportunities for more people across regional Australia. That's why we see unemployment so low. That's why we've seen well over a million jobs created: because we've created the environment for investment across Australia, and we're going to keep doing that to make sure that we keep creating more job opportunities for more Australians.
