        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. Proceedings against former

        commissioner Nigel Hadgkiss, in which he has admitted to recklessly breaching the Fair Work Act by failing to accurately reflect the law in Fair Work publications, were commenced on 22 August 2016. Yesterday the minister advised the Senate that she became aware of the behaviour in October 2016. Why did it take two months for the minister to become aware of Mr Hadgkiss's illegal conduct?

         I thank Senator Wong for the question. As I indicated yesterday, the claims against Mr Hadgkiss were first brought to my attention in October 2016, when the

           I again ask—because she didn't answer the question—why it took the minister two months to become aware of the illegal conduct. Given that she did know, by her own admission, in October 2016 of the illegal conduct, why did the minister appoint Mr Hadgkiss as commissioner of the

            I reject the premise of almost all of those questions. I made it very clear in my answers both today and yesterday—to Senator Cameron's question—that I became aware of the behaviour, or the conduct, in October 2016. At that time, they were allegations that were contested by Mr Hadgkiss. The conduct was not illegal at the time. It was on Tuesday of this month that Mr Hadgkiss admitted to the breach. At that time, I became aware of the breach. In relation to the appointment of Mr Hadgkiss, I as minister did not appoint Mr Hadgkiss. Senator Wong would be aware that, when the
