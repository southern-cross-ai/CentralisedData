        Tonight I want to provide the Senate with a brief update on the Postcards to the Front campaign, which I've spoken about in this place previously. To remind senators, Postcards to the Front is a global campaign aimed at sending messages of support and encouragement to brave Ukrainians on the front line of the war with Russia. In the last couple of weeks, the Russia-Ukraine war has been knocked off the front pages of the newspaper, which I find a bit unfortunate. The issues there have not changed; they have not improved. It's really important that we don't forget what Ukraine is going through at the moment and we don't let the issues there become overshadowed by recent events. It's really important that we remind people that that war is ongoing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The messages in the Postcards to the Front campaign are a reminder that the world does stand with those at the front in Ukraine and has not forgotten their struggle. Australia and Canada have been the most active national branches of this initiative, and I'm really pleased to report that the Australian branch has so far sent over 7,500 postcards, which is a phenomenal achievement, to the front. I congratulate the Australian coordinator, Peter Ramadge, on his huge efforts, as well as the campaign's Ukrainian founder, Tamara Levit.
       </p>
       <p>
        A postcard may sound like an empty gesture, but the feedback from the defenders of Ukraine have been so overwhelmingly positive. One person said, 'Nothing warms the soldiers' hearts like a handwritten letter,' and another said, 'The postcards make us calm and motivated. The darkest day would be a bit brighter because somebody handwrote their sincere support to us.'
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not hard to do. As senators would be aware, I've written to all parliamentarians to encourage their participation, and I sincerely thank all members and senators of the parliament, including the Prime Minister, who have contributed. Anyone can send a postcard to the front. You can also send more than one. In fact, you can write regularly. For guidance on what to write, visit postcardstothefront.com.au, where you can also find the Australian address to forward them to. If you live near my electorate office in Kingston, in Hobart, or work in the parliamentary building—it's open to staff as well, not just politicians—feel free to drop by my electorate or parliamentary office, pick up a postcard, write a simple message and leave it with my staff, who will forward it on.
       </p>
       <p>
        I don't think I can reiterate enough tonight how welcome these postcards are to those on the front line. It's not just professional soldiers but also civilians who've joined up to protect their country against the immoral invasion by Russia. I've had a lot to do with Ukrainians over the 40-odd years that I've been married to my husband, and they're a very strong people. They're a very dignified people. They want to support their country. They believe—as do
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_and_I" rel="nofollow">
         I and I
        </a>
        think most people in this parliament, if not all—that the Russian invasion was immoral and illegal. They're such a strong national group of people. I really find it hard to put into words exactly how strong they are, but they will defend their country to their deaths. You can be sure of that.
       </p>
       <p>
        All I'm asking is that people write a simple postcard to these people. It can just be, 'We are thinking of you in these awful times.' It doesn't have to be an essay. It doesn't have to be a book. It's simply a postcard. So I would encourage people to do that. As I stated earlier, the message reminds those people that the world stands with them. In this geopolitical landscape that we've got, with the issues involved in other countries that have conflict going on, I would just ask people to remember those Ukrainians that are supporting their country.
