        My question is to the Minister for

        and Water, Senator Wong. Given that the Prime Minister has claimed we must introduce an emissions trading scheme by the end of the year in order to avoid so-called carbon tariffs, would the minister tell the Senate specifically which countries are planning to impose a carbon tariff on Australia?

               advocating a border adjustment mechanism. They said: ‘We write to express our strong support for the inclusion of a package of initiatives, including a border adjustment mechanism to ensure the viability and effectiveness of any climate change policy crafted by Congress.’ This is a live issue in the discussions internationally and if those opposite cared to actually keep up with the facts they would already know that. The Prime Minister was quite right to raise this. I again emphasise that this is not Australia’s position. We do not support going down the protectionist path. That is not how the bill before the Senate, which those opposite voted against, was framed. But this is an issue—

                 The senator might like to be aware that the issue of climate change related tariffs has also been under consideration within the European Union, and in March this year
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Sarkozy" rel="nofollow">
                  President Sarkozy
                 </a>
                 in fact floated a proposal for a carbon tax on imports from countries that have a lower environmental standard than France. This issue was also the subject of public discussion following a European environment ministers meeting in July. It really shows that those opposite are prepared to say anything, make any false claim, in order to try and dodge this tough issue of climate change. The reality is that this is a live issue in the negotiations and the international debate. If you kept up with the debate, you would know that. You are not interested in keeping up with the debate because you are only interested in fighting with each other on whether or not you are actually going to have a coherent position on climate change.

                   I might assist the opposition as well on this issue. If they turned to the last page of the Frontier Economics report that they sort of support—sort of—they would see that they themselves, in their report that they have paid for, acknowledge that border taxes are an option. You yourselves acknowledge that. I quote:

                  <p class="italic">
                   Options for reducing this risk both involve offsetting the loss of competitiveness of local products versus foreign substitutes ... these include:

                  <ul>
                   <li>
                    Border taxes to increase the costs of foreign produced goods.

                   So you are suggesting that the Prime Minister, in telling us what is factually correct, is somehow running a scare campaign when you yourselves, in your own modelling report, have alluded to the fact that this is a live issue. This really shows the extent to which those opposite are prepared to engage in fear and smear rather than dealing with the issue of climate change, rather than being responsible on an issue that is so important to the future of this nation.
