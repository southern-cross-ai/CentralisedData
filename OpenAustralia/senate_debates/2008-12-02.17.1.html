        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Faulkner. Is the minister aware of reports that last Sunday the cruise ship
        <i>

        </i>
        , with 50 Australians aboard, came under direct threat of piracy in the

        </a>
        ? In view of the evident threat to Australian lives, what steps is the government taking to protect Australians travelling in a vital shipping lane, one that has become the world’s most dangerous stretch of ocean?

           That was the question, Senator. I am aware of media reports of the incident involving pirates and a luxury cruise ship, the
           <i>
            Oceania Nautica
           </i>
           , in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden" rel="nofollow">
            Gulf of Aden
           </a>
           between Somalia and Yemen on Saturday, 29 December. I understand that approximately 50 Australians were among the 684 passengers. Our embassy in Riyadh has confirmed that shots were fired at the ship but no passengers or crew were injured and the ship has continued with its cruise. The embassy is attempting to make contact with the shipping company concerned to offer any consular assistance required.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advice ‘Travelling by sea’ includes strong advice on the dangers of piracy, particularly in and around Somali waters and the Gulf of Aden. Australians are advised to exercise extreme caution when anywhere near these waters. To our knowledge, no other Australians nor any Australian vessels have been subjected to recent attacks by pirates in the region. This of course does not lessen the gravity of the situation. As senators may be aware, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
            UN Security Council
           </a>
           is currently considering what further steps can be taken to address piracy off Somalia’s coast.

            I thank the minister for his response and for his recognition of the gravity of this situation and ask a supplementary question. Is it true that earlier this year the government convened an interagency assessment of the piracy threat to shipping in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden" rel="nofollow">
             Gulf of Aden
            </a>
            and decided to leave counterpiracy activities and the protection of Australian interests to other countries?

             I have no briefing on that issue. If it is of assistance to Senator Trood I can certainly confirm that Australia has supported UN efforts on the issue. I do know that in June 2008 Australia co-sponsored an antipiracy resolution that was unanimously passed by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
              UN Security Council
             </a>
             and I know that this resolution enables states and regional organisations to undertake all necessary means to combat piracy off Somalia’s coast in a manner consistent with international law, and the council is considering renewing the resolution. Senator, I have no briefing specifically on the matter that you have raised and I will need to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he can address it for you.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. Minister, I would be grateful if you would explore that matter and provide an answer to the Senate because it is a matter of considerable importance. In light of this very serious matter and the fact that Australian lives are potentially at threat in these circumstances it seems to me that we should take rather more action than just supporting UN actions. So I ask the minister whether or not there have been any more specific activities undertaken, either through diplomatic channels or otherwise, that can ensure and guarantee to Australians that their lives will not be at risk when they are on cruises?

               Perhaps I can assist Senator Trood at least in part in response to his second supplementary question. It is certainly the case that a number of countries are contributing naval resources for surveillance and protection activities off Somalia’s coast. This includes members of the European Union,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
                NATO

               and others. Australia is considering whether there is any way we may be able to support these efforts but, of course, senators would be aware that
