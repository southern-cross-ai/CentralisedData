        It has been a long day and I know that everybody is getting ready to get away, but it is important for us to acknowledge R U
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ? Day. In my role as assistant shadow minister for mental health to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Collins" rel="nofollow">
         Julie Collins
        </a>
        , I feel really privileged that people who work in the mental health sector have provided me with the wisdom of their experiences and the challenges they face. I know that public communication campaigns about mental health are actually changing the landscape in which our conversations at least are beginning.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate all those who have made R U OK? Day an institution now in Australia's mental health awareness. It is today, and that is why I want make remarks this evening at the end of a very long day. R U OK? Day reminds us all that, if we are worried about someone, we actually have what it takes to start a meaningful conversation. There is a form of mental care that we can give to one another in our common humanity. It's not a skill that we have to acquire through any sort of qualification; we can just get up and help one another.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are four simple steps being advocated by R U OK? advocates. The first is to ask, 'Are you okay?' The second is often harder to do—it is listening. We in this place are certainly pretty good at talking, but sometimes the listening is a little harder to do. Listening means that we hear what people say and maybe we say back to them what we've heard them say. This is reflective listening: 'This is what I heard you say. Is this what you mean?' It is about actually really listening to somebody, not just spending time while they talk.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also want to encourage action. If it becomes apparent to you that people aren't feeling particularly well, then the idea is to encourage them to take some steps, such as going to a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        or getting official assistance if they need it. The follow-up step is not too onerous. A few days later—set a reminder in your diary—check in to see how they are and make sure that they are okay. These are simple things, but in our busy lives we can be distracted. These are simple ways in which we can help one another. The conversations that we have can make a profound difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today is the real day for R U OK?, but we can undertake this activity every single day of our lives. If someone you know is not acting quite the same as they have been, if you notice something, if they are a little bit withdrawn or if they are just not being themselves, it is really incumbent upon all of us in this journey of life to act on that and look after the people around us. Start a conversation with a family member, a friend or a person sitting next to you at work. You should ask them, 'Are you okay?'
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that help is available. We're not all expected to be professional counsellors. If people have serious challenges that they are facing in their life, sadly, some people will be experiencing a period of depression or vulnerability and they might have serious suicidal thoughts and behaviours that can be too much for family or friends to handle. There are many dedicated professionals and organisations, such as Lifeline and beyondblue. If anybody listening to this broadcast is feeling a little down on this day, there are wonderful resources available for them to plug into. They can just Google beyondblue or Lifeline and there will be somebody there to have a conversation with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to continue to address suicide as, sadly, the number of lives lost is growing. Despite all the progress that has been made with our capacity to talk about mental health and wellbeing, heartbreakingly, the leading cause of death for men and women in Australia between the ages of 15 and 44 is suicide. At this time there is a very pressing responsibility on us in this place as legislators to be mindful of that statistic. Even though much progress has been made to reduce the stigma associated with mental ill health, so much more can and must be done. We need to get more women and definitely more men talking about this. Deaths from suicide occur amongst Australian men at a rate three times greater than that for Australian women. These statistics are confronting and are a significant reminder of the need for a coordinated effort across government and the community to reduce youth suicide.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to close with some comments about youth suicide, because in 2015 suicide accounted for around one-third of the deaths of young people aged 15 to 24. On average, eight young people die by suicide every single week in Australia. In just a few seconds, you can just think and be still enough to think about the impact of that on a family, the impact on their friends at school and the impact on their workmates. It's such a devastating reality for us. Eight young Australian men or women, with their entire lives ahead of them, are feeling that life is not worth living. We can reach out to them. The beginning of the conversation is as simple as asking, 'Are you okay?'
       </p>
       <p>
        Kids Helpline is a fantastic youth-dedicated helpline. Dedicated youth specialists deal with these issues, and they really have a great understanding of what's happening with young people and how to prevent these tragedies from happening. Kids Helpline has found that young people do not ask for help for a number of reasons. Young people are worried, basically, that they might not be understood, they will be judged, they will be called an attention seeker or they will be a burden.
       </p>
       <p>
        We really have to change that message to young people. We want to tell young people that we care about how they are feeling and that we will listen when they want to speak about issues. We will notice them. We will see them. All I can say, again, is the four things: ask, 'Are you okay', listen, encourage action and check in. Every one of us has a story. Every one of us can do something to prevent suicide and to enhance mental health and wellbeing in our community.
