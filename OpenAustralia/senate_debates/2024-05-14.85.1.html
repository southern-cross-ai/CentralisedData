        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Science, Senator Farrell. I refer to the Albanese Labor government's recent announcements about our plan to rebuild Australia's manufacturing capability and ensure a future made in Australia. Can the minister advise how the Albanese government is working to deliver a future made in Australia and create more well-paid, secure jobs across the country, including in my home state of Queensland?

         I thank Senator Green for her question. The Albanese Labor government is preparing for the opportunities of the future and wants to ensure that all Australians benefit. Too many times we've seen Australian know-how and Australian resources used to create jobs and opportunities for other countries. We need to help industries grow and create the conditions that they need to thrive locally.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just a few weeks ago, the government made a major investment in technology in Queensland. Around the world, Australians are leading the charge on quantum technologies, and this government is committed to ensuring the future of quantum happens here in Australia. That's why the Albanese government is investing $470 million in PsiQuantum to ensure their next phase of growth happens right here in Australia. This will create 400 new jobs in Brisbane, directly at PsiQuantum, and countless more as our quantum ecosystem evolves and grows. We are building manufacturing—

         I am! I'm doing that exactly, Senator Birmingham. We're also building manufacturing opportunities for the future, helping Australia achieve its potential as a renewable energy superpower.

         Last month, also in Queensland, that very fine minister, Minister Husic, attended the launch of the new Fortescue hydrogen electrolyser advanced facility. The facility—

         Yes—an advanced facility. The facility will produce green hydrogen electrolysers at an industrial scale. This project is strengthening the nation's manufacturing capability and creating new well-paid jobs.

           I do have another question. Can the minister please inform the Senate how the Albanese Labor government is backing local businesses to be more competitive in new and emerging industries and ensuring that Australia's industrial, technological and scientific strengths will benefit all Australians through our plan for a future made in Australia?

            , earlier this month, we saw the first commercial civil space rocket launched from Australian soil, facilitated by local company Southern Launch, and it was a great success. This is the first time that a hybrid rocket has been powered by paraffin wax, a more environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional rocket fuel. It's a great example of an Australian industry competing globally and creating jobs locally. The

            of the Koonibba Community Aboriginal Corporation, Corey McLennan, said that, every time we do a launch, there are somewhere up to 25 jobs in our local community.

                  okay, 12—the Albanese government is cleaning up the mess left by the coalition. We're getting to work creating secure manufacturing jobs. This is a stark contrast to the approach of those opposite. Those opposite are all negativity, zero plan. At every opportunity, they are opposing what will grow manufacturing in this country into the future, and they opposed energy price relief. They opposed the National Reconstruction Fund. Their instinct was always to oppose tax cuts for manufacturing workers. This government proudly supports Australian businesses to grow and to thrive, and that's why we are getting on with the job of growing Australian manufacturing.
