        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to the government's decision to cut bulk-billing incentives for medical imaging services and impose a new $7

        tax. Is the minister aware of the statement by the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many people will simply be unable to afford it under the measures announced in this Budget—especially if they have to pay the full cost up front—and many conditions will therefore go undiagnosed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, is the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association correct?

         I am not aware of that specific comment. I am aware that there have been a range of views, since the budget was brought down, on the budget and the measures contained in that budget. The government has been extremely clear that we have to implement measures to ensure the sustainability of the health system into the future. We have been overtly clear that the measures that we are taking in the budget are to achieve that end. We have inherited an economic mess from the previous Labor government that has to be fixed. As the finance minister just said, if we do not make the decisions now and take the action now that needs to be taken, then we are going to be in a disastrous situation down the track, because it is absolutely vital—and people understand—that we have a sustainable health system into the future.

                     I did address the question at the outset of my answer. It was those opposite who raised the issue of cuts. Those opposite wanted to cut $400 million out of medical research funding. If we want to address the issue of cuts, there were a litany from those opposite when it came to health. This government is absolutely committed to ensuring a sustainable health system into the future and, unlike those opposite, as I said previously, this government will take the tough decisions to ensure that we achieve that.

                      , I have a further supplementary question for Minister Nash. Minister, won't increasing upfront costs deter patients from seeking early diagnosis and make our health system less sustainable?

                       The measures in the government's budget will ensure a more sustainable health system into the future. It was under the previous government that policies were in place that were going to lead to an unsustainable health system. Unlike those opposite, this government will have in our budget efficient and effective measures that taxpayers can afford. Unlike those opposite, we will make sure that we have improved health outcomes and, at the same time, ensure that we have a health system into the future that is sustainable for the nation.
