        In Darwin over the weekend, hundreds of Territorians gathered outside
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        following the tragic death of young 20-year-old Declan Laverty while he was at work. They went there to support the family of young Declan but also to call on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        government, and others across the community, to do something.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many Territorians have spoken of their frustration with living with crime, but they also went there, as I said, to stand in solidarity with the family of young Declan. This comes in the midst of concerning rates of crime, antisocial behaviour and alcohol-related issues, which we have been dealing with quite significantly, particularly since January this year, beginning of course with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        . I'm very conscious of the concerns in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennant_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Tennant Creek
        </a>
        , Katherine and Darwin, and I know that the Northern Territory government is very aware of those concerns as well. I'll certainly be in touch with them once I return from the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to say to senators that today in the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper we saw an article by journalist Liam Mendes. He has heard directly from the family of the accused. There is no doubt there will continue to be a lot of reflection, especially for the family of the accused, a family from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwi_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Tiwi Islands
        </a>
        . I know they are reflecting very deeply on what has occurred and the tragedy that has taken place for the Laverty family. I'd urge Territorians to remember that, on another level, there is a legal process, a court process, that has to be taken now, and while that is going on of course there must be other issues touched on in terms of concerns around crime.
