        My question is to the Minister for Finance and the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. The Albanese government understands safe, secure and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians, including economic security. Can the minister outline to the Senate how the government's recent announcements in housing will provide greater economic security to Australians who are finding it difficult to find a safe, secure and affordable place to call home? How do these announcements align with the government's broader ambitious housing agenda?

         I thank Senator Walsh for the question and for her advocacy on matters relating to housing and housing affordability, particularly in Victoria. I note that the announcement on the weekend will mean that her good state will receive in the order of just under $500 million so that there's extra investment going into affordable and social housing in the state of Victoria.
        </p>
        <p>
         Research by Equity Economics has estimated that $257 million in homelessness support services and $122.5 million in domestic violence support services could be saved through more funding and investment going into social housing. That's why building more homes has been central to our first two budgets and to our overall economic plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is one of the reasons why the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing announced, on the weekend, the $2 billion social housing accelerator program, which will provide new money in the next two weeks for new social housing, including $50 million for my jurisdiction of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         . This will create thousands of homes for Australians on social housing waiting lists and will increase housing supply sooner, with all the funding to be committed by the states and territories within two years.
        </p>
        <p>
         This continues the work of the new National Housing Accord, which is a shared ambition to build one million new homes over five years from 2024, and builds on the work of National Cabinet on renters' rights and planning reform. It will also build on the Albanese government's unlocking of $575 million in the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, which is currently being put to work to support new social and affordable rental housing. Also, on top of the investment in housing and homelessness services, it'll bring the total investment to $9Â½ billion in this financial year alone.

           The Albanese government recognises the important role that the property and construction sectors play in our economy and in putting roofs over the heads of Australians. Can the minister outline to the Senate the views of the property and construction sector on the government's recent housing announcement?

            I thank Senator Walsh for the supplementary. The Albanese government has recorded the strongest jobs growth in the first year of any new government on record, with more than 465,000 jobs created since we came to government. We've seen new analysis released today that shows Australia is also a world leader when it comes to job creation and workforce participation. But we know that, if more people are to benefit from the strong labour market, we need to ensure there are affordable homes close to those where those job opportunities are being created, and that's why building more homes has been central to our first two budgets and to our economic plan. It's why our social housing accelerator program has been so warmly welcomed across the housing sector. As Denita Wawn from the Master Builders said:

              Minister, in your first answer you talked about how the Albanese government's social housing accelerator is part of the government's broader ambitious housing agenda. Can the minister update the Senate on that agenda, and what are the risks to its implementation?

               Thank you, Senator Walsh. We do have an ambitious housing agenda and we've added to it at every opportunity. A key part of that agenda is our Housing Australia Future Fund. The $10 billion fund is about creating a secure and ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable rental homes over the longer term. The fund has the support of our nation's peak housing bodies as well as every state and territory housing minister. Indeed, it's hard to find anyone who could possibly argue against this fund, except right here in the Senate, where we have a majority of senators arguing against the fund. It would allow $500 million each year for new social and affordable rental homes. The answer is right there. We need to ensure that this housing fund gets established as soon as possible.
