        My question is directed to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. In so doing, I express on behalf of all Labor senators our distress and regret at the tragic crash of the

         I thank Senator Evans for that very important question. The government, of course, joins with the opposition, and, I am sure, the entire Senate, in expressing our sadness at what has been a tragic accident. As Senator Evans noted, an Australian Army
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
          Black Hawk
         </a>
         helicopter conducting a routine training flight crashed yesterday afternoon while attempting to land on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Kanimbla
         </i>
         . The pilot regrettably lost his life and, as Senator Evans noted, another serviceman, an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
          SAS
         </a>
         trooper, is missing. I am sure that I speak for all senators in extending our deepest sympathies to the family of the pilot. We also feel for the family of the SAS trooper, desperately waiting for news of his whereabouts. An Orion P3C aircraft has been deployed to assist with an intensive search for him. Seven of the other Army personnel sustained minor injuries, but we can all be thankful that they have not been more seriously hurt. We certainly wish them a very speedy recovery. The deceased pilot and seven of those involved in this accident are being repatriated to Noumea by the HMAS
         <i>
          Newcastle
         </i>
         where they will be picked up by a C130 for return to Australia by tomorrow afternoon. I assure the Senate that they are being escorted at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
         There will, of course, be an inquiry into the causes of the accident in the hope that we can minimise the risks for any future operations. The investigation of the accident has commenced. The HMAS
         <i>
          Newcastle
         </i>
         will pick up a specialised accident investigation team in Noumea and return to Fiji waters. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of the Defence Force
         </a>
         has indicated that the feasibility of recovering the helicopter is being investigated, but notes that the helicopter appears to be in waters around 3,000 metres deep. The Black Hawk is a tried and tested helicopter. It is in use in 25 countries and it has been in service in Australia for some 18 years, including in the maritime environment. As the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
          CDF
         </a>
         has said, we have full confidence in the protection and survivability that it provides our crews.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Defence Community Organisation is focused on supporting the families of those personnel affected by this accident. Additional support is being provided to those aboard the HMAS
         <i>
          Kanimbla
         </i>
         and their parent units. Despite this tragedy, our defence forces remain ready and able to assist Australians in Fiji, if that contingency arises. Our defence forces earn plaudits for their efforts around the globe, but I think Australians are particularly proud when they see our troops involved in humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts, whether they be in Timor, Aceh or, as in this case, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
          South Pacific
         </a>
         . These servicemen stood ready to assist their fellow Australians in Fiji, if the need arose, so this terrible accident is a reminder that all service, whether it be in war or peace, has significant risks attached. Our defence personnel shoulder those risks, knowing their service is in the interests of the nation and of their fellow citizens and we thank them for it.
