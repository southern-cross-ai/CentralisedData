        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. In an extraordinary press conference today, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus and Ministers Clare O'Neil and Andrew Giles refused to apologise to any members of the Australian community who were subjected to misdeeds by some of the detainees that your government released into our community. Will the Prime Minister apologise to those Australians, or does he stand with his Attorney-General and ministers in refusing to apologise?

         I thank the senator for her question. The first point I would make is, again, the senator is using Senator Cash's political words of 'your government released'. The senator would know that this was not a choice to release; this was imposed upon the Australian government by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          High Court of Australia
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         No amount of interjection from the shadow Attorney-General can obviate that fundamental fact: this was imposed on us by the High Court.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second point is this. This is a serious issue. The government understands that Australians are concerned about community safety. We understand and are similarly appalled by reports of reoffending by those that the High Court required us to release. I do express my thoughts to those who have been impacted by the court ordered release of this cohort. You have heard me say in here many times in various contexts that everyone deserves to feel safe and to live in safety, and that is certainly the approach the government seeks to take in a situation where the High Court has imposed its decision to release.
        </p>
        <p>
         Within a week and one day of the decision, the government had in place a visa regime with conditions attached. We had already set up a new regime of community protection, establishing a joint operation between police and the Australian Border Force, who are case-managing each of these individuals in the community. I am also advised that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         and the Australian Border Force briefed state and territory premiers and chief ministers on Operation
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEGIS" rel="nofollow">
          AEGIS
         </a>
         , further ensuring all jurisdictions are working together to keep our community safe. Tonight, in the House, the opposition will have the opportunity to support the legislation we passed in this place yesterday for a tough preventive detention regime.

           The Attorney-General labelled the question from Olivia Caisley of Sky News asking whether the ministers would apologise as 'absurd'. Do you agree that it is absurd to think that Australians harmed by these detainees may actually be owed an apology?

            I accept that Australians harmed by those who the High Court required be released are distressed, angry and upset. I accept that. The government accept the government's responsibility when faced with a High Court decision that we had no choice over.

                   I was coming to that. That is a reasonable proposition, Senator Cash.

                    Minister Wong, please resume your seat. Senator Cash and Senator Ruston, I have already lost count, in the first few minutes of question time, of how many times I have called you to order—and Senator McGrath. When I call the chamber to order it includes every senator in this place. Minister Wong, please continue.

                      Senator Ruston, I must have called you about seven times. I am not going to go for an hour calling you to order. I am asking senators to respect my order, and that includes you, and it includes you to be respectful and silent.
