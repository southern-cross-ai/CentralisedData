        Tonight our nation is caught within a moment of decision. Before us now is a question: will justice be done for disabled people or will we once again miss the opportunity to ensure that those in our nation who are so often made voiceless are heard?
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, I'd like to read a passage from a speech given by my fellow disability activist and advocate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Wallace" rel="nofollow">
         Craig Wallace
        </a>
        , who, in 2015, as part of the White Flower Memorial to commemorate all those who died in institutional and residential care, spoke to the sorrow and pain of our community. In concluding, he said, 'I call for those who have left us to be remembered, for their names and stories to be said out loud in the sunlight and amongst the people who love them.' Tonight, I seek to speak their names, and though the sun does not shine in this place I hope that their stories will move the hearts of those who have it within their power to see justice done. The following names are those who have died in the lead-up or subsequent to the Senate inquiry which called for a royal commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shellay Ward, aged seven, was found locked in a room without sunlight, surrounded by faeces. Shellay died from starvation and thirst, and she weighed only nine kilogramsâ€”a third of her expected body weight. She had severe autism and was considered to be profoundly disabled.
       </p>
       <p>
        Levi Bonnar, seven years old, was found beaten, tortured and finally killed by the people who were meant to care for him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hayley Dea Bell was eight years old. When she was found in 2013 she was starved, suffering from pneumonia and her hair was infested with lice and matted with dirt.
       </p>
       <p>
        Isabella Leiper was nine. She died from a combination of internal injuries which paediatricians said were caused by blunt force to the stomach, such as a fist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Julian was 11. He was left to freeze to death in a shed. He had first been hosed with water after having faeces rubbed in his face.
       </p>
       <p>
        Liam Milne and his younger brother.

       </p>
       <p>
        Lara Madigan, 20, was returned to her parents' care at 19, despite stating that they could not look after her. Nine months before her death, authorities were warned she would die if the situation was not addressed. Two weeks before her death, both of her legs were amputated to attempt to stem infection. She died covered in her own faeces and urine in a room infested with cockroaches.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sarah Hammoud, 22, a disabled young woman who was unable to speak and reportedly half-dragged and half-carried herself from a taxi after a shocking incident, allegedly witnessed by community workers, later died in hospital in 2016 of septicaemia.

       </p>
       <p>
        Jamie Vincent Johnson, age undisclosed. His care plan stated that he should not be left alone with water because he would drink it without stopping. He died after being left alone in the shower.
       </p>

       <p>
        Amanda Gilbert, 47, who had an acquired brain injury as a result of attempted suicide and was placed in the Graylands Hospital psychiatric care centre in my home state of WA. She was raped and assaulted 111 times and died as a result of complications used in the medication to sedate her. The WA coroner believes this to have been an underestimation of the number of times that she was raped.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leah Elizabeth Floyd died when a pressure sore she had received at her care home became septic. The inquest heard about serious issues in the facility that she lived.

        These are the names that don't get spoken. These are the reasons. These are the human beings. These are the loved ones, the mothers, the fathers, the sons and the partners who need justice, who demand justice, whose lives were worth living, in whose memory I tonight wear a white flower and whose passing fills me with an ironclad determination. I will not stop and I will not rest until they find the justice that is so desperately owed them.
