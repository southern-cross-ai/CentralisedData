        My question is to Senator Sherry, representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It relates to the government’s financial support for

        and its network state and territory chambers, and the recent extensive advertising campaign they have been promoting. The campaign receives partial funding from the department. It is designed to assist consumers to identify Australian made and Australian grown produce as well as Australian owned companies. But the definitions of what constitutes an Australian product could arguably cause more confusion to consumers. For example, under the definitions endorsed—

            Very well. Given that this campaign can easily create confusion amongst consumers, given that a product can be labelled ‘made in Australia’ even if 50 per cent of its production has occurred overseas, can the minister reveal what level of taxpayer funding is being provided to it?

             Thank you, Senator Xenophon. I think the questions are getting better as question time goes on. Senator Xenophon, you did give me some notice and I think you raise an important issue in the context of the

             campaign and food labelling laws in this country. Firstly, the department provided some $1.69 million in seed funding to 30 June for the start-up marketing and promotion of the Australian Grown campaign. In your question—your long and detailed question—you did pose a number of I think quite reasonable issues that—

              No, seriously—they were perfectly reasonable issues that the minister I represent, Mr Burke, has been giving some consideration to. I note the minister was recently interviewed by
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Byner" rel="nofollow">
               Leon Byner
              </a>
              —I think he is familiar to you, Senator Xenophon—on 5AA in Adelaide. In fact he interviewed the minister I represent, Mr Burke, on the matters that you raise. That followed, of course, the publication in, I think, the Adelaide

               Advertiser
              </i>
              , which I must confess I do read, even on the north-west coast of Tasmania. It is as impressive a paper as the

               Advocate
              </i>
              . The minister went through a range of issues. To start with, the minister acknowledged that the bureaucratic and ministerial oversight in determining the food labelling laws in this country usually, as represented by the health minister, the agriculture minister—

Given that a product can be called ‘Australian grown’ even if some of the production processes have occurred overseas and that a company can call itself ‘Australian owned’ even if all of its products are manufactured overseas, and given the taxpayer support for this campaign, why hasn’t the government demanded stricter definitions for Australian made and Australian grown products in order to protect consumers and Australian producers?

                   The minister acknowledged, for example, that a fruitcake that is labelled ‘made in Australia’ can be made of imported fruit, and he rightly pointed out that, in the context of the ‘grown in Australia’ label, the cake perhaps should indicate where the food itself is grown. So there is certainly an issue here that the minister has acknowledged. He also acknowledged that the council—
