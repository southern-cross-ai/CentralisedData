        The Review made five recommendations, all of which have either been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.

        The Government has full confidence that no such breach will occur in future.

        Relevant and experienced operational authorities have determined that Operation Sovereign Borders activities can be achieved consistent with Government policy. This is consistent with the findings of the Review.

        , Lieutenant General Ash Power, and Deputy CEO Border Enforcement, Roman Quaedvlieg accepted the findings of professional conduct inquiries that none of the headquarters officers involved deliberately contravened orders not to enter Indonesian waters. However, both authorities determined that there were individual lapses in professional conduct that warranted further action.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of the inquiries, administrative action has been implemented against three Defence and one ACBPS personnel attached to headquarter elements. Relevant administrative action includes administrative sanctions and formal counselling.

        administrative action which has resulted in informal counselling of a further six officers in non-command roles.

       <p class="italic">
        During the course of administrative inquiries into the actions of headquarters personnel it became evident that the conduct of ACBPS officers serving on

         Australian Customs Vessels
        </a>
        also required further investigation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further investigation revealed that during the course of Operation Sovereign Borders, a member of the crew serving on board an Australian Customs and Border Protection Vessel identified potential issues with the methodology being used to calculate the Indonesian archipelagic baseline which might lead to the vessel entering Indonesian waters. Although this was brought to the attention of the ACBPS officer in charge of the vessel, he failed to adequately report and escalate this
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        information to his chain of command and continued with the operation, resulting in a breach of Indonesian waters. Code of conduct action has been initiated in relation to this officer and is yet to be finalised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All professional conduct inquiries conducted by the ADF and ACBPS have yielded findings consistent with those of the Review. That is, that the incursions were inadvertent, and occurred as a consequence of incorrect calculations of Indonesian Maritime Boundaries by Australian crews.
