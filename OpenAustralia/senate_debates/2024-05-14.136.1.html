        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 7 December 2023, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs (the Committee) released its final report for the
        <i>
         Inquiry into the worsening rental crisis in Australia
        </i>
        (the Inquiry).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government welcomes the final report and thanks the Committee for its work.

        Committee Proceedings
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 22 June 2023 the Senate referred an inquiry into the worsening rental crisis in Australia to the Community Affairs References Committee for inquiry and report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">
         The Inquiry
        </a>
        received 410 written submissions, with over 16,000 simplified submissions from members of the public. The Departments of Treasury and Social Services (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSS" rel="nofollow">
         DSS
        </a>
        ) provided a joint submission.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        held four public hearings. Treasury, DSS and the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (now Housing Australia) gave evidence at the public hearing held on 27 September 2023.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee published its interim report on 21 September 2023, and its final report on 7 December 2023.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A total of 43 recommendations were made across the final and interim reports. The final report makes 38 recommendations, and 5 recommendations were made as part of the interim report. This response is to the 43 recommendations made across the interim and final reports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government acknowledges the challenging experience that many renters are facing, and thanks the thousands of Australians who shared their lived experiences with the Committee. The current environment has created pressures for the growing number of Australians who rent. Renters tend to be younger, have lower incomes, less wealth and live in lower-quality housing than owner-occupiers. In recent times, some have been left worse-off with advertised rent growth exceeding inflation and average wage increases. This is likely to be causing hardship for more vulnerable renters and may be pushing some into insecure housing arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Moderating price pressures in the short term is challenging. The most effective way to sustainably improve rental affordability is to increase housing supply. The Government is pursuing a number of policies to boost supply, address the cost of housing for buyers and renters and make it easier for renters to transition into home ownership. These policies are part of a plan to deliver 1.2 million new homes over five years from 1 July, including 50,000 new rental homes. They also form part of the more than $25 billion in new investments in housing over the next decade the Government has announced since its election. Further details on these measures are at Appendix A.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In response to the 43 recommendations, the Australian Government supports 12 recommendations, supports in principle 3 recommendations, partially supports 3 recommendations, notes 21 recommendations, and does not support 4 recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response to the interim recommendations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Greens recommend the Australian Government coordinate with the states and territories to freeze rental increases for two years, followed by a limit on rental increases of 2 per cent every 2 years. Both the freeze and the ongoing limits should be attached to the property, not the specific tenancy or lease. The reference date for the freeze on rental increases should be backdated to avoid rents being increased in anticipation of the restrictions. The freeze and ongoing cap should apply to new properties where starting rents are set at the median rent for the area and property type.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Australian Government response
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government acknowledges that renters are facing significant challenges.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The regulation of residential tenancies, including rental agreements and pricing, is the responsibility of state and territory governments. On 16 August 2023, National Cabinet agreed to A Better Deal for Renters, which includes developing a nationally consistent policy to require genuine reasonable grounds for eviction, moving towards limiting rental increases to once a year and phasing in minimum rental standards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is strong consensus in academic literature on the negative impacts of rent freezes as they reduce both the quantity and quality of housing available in the market, making it harder for tenants to secure housing that meets their needs. In a similar vein, evidence from academic literature on rent caps suggests unintended consequences for renters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Achieving the policy objectives of rental price intervention is difficult as it limits labour market mobility, is inequitable, imposes negative externalities, negatively affects the quality of rental stock, imposes costs on future renters and leads to a reduction in rental supply and increases in rental costs, leaving many renters worse off in the long term. For example, San Francisco's rent caps were found to have resulted in a number of landlords either moving into the properties themselves or selling them. This reduced the supply of available rental stock by 15 per cent and led to a 5.1 per cent increase in overall rent prices over the next twenty years—creating an overall rise in rents of $2.9 billion that was paid for by current and future tenants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The most effective way to sustainably improve rental affordability is to increase housing supply and the Australian Government has committed to several measures aimed at boosting supply as part of its housing reform agenda. Further information is at Appendix A.

        The National Housing and Homelessness Plan, which is being developed and is expected to be released in 2024, will set out a vision for housing and homelessness policy in Australia, and consider public, social, and affordable housing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Future funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and states and territories are also under negotiation. The Australian Government has agreed to a one-year extension to the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement (NHHA) which will provide approximately $1.7 billion in 2023-24 to the states and territories. The extension provides further time to work with states to develop and negotiate new funding arrangements to replace the NHHA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has increased the maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRA" rel="nofollow">
         CRA
        </a>
        ) by 15 per cent at a cost of around $0.7 billion per year. This is the largest increase to CRA maximum rates in more than 30 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is also providing $4 billion over ten years, through a joint investment with the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT
        </a>
        communities. This investment builds on the one-year Northern Territory Remote Housing Agreement which accelerated housing delivery in 2023-24. The Government has invested $111.7 million through the agreement, which is matched by the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the Government has committed $120 million over three years to extend funding for repairs and maintenance on housing and essential infrastructure on Northern Territory Homelands. This investment matches the NT Government's existing program of $40 million per annum and builds on progress made through the Government's $100 million election commitment to restore funding for homelands.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council" rel="nofollow">
         The Council
        </a>
        is developing a model on housing supply and demand, to provide a comprehensive view of how construction activity, housing stock, rental prices and housing prices are influenced by economic factors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Council will also produce a State of the Nation's Housing Report each year that will, among other things, outline the number of households in housing need.

        The Australian Government recognises the need for more social and affordable housing. That is why it is working with state and territory governments and industry to deliver 50,000 social and affordable homes in the 5 years from July 2024. This is part of the more than $25 billion in new investments in housing over the next decade announced since its election. Further information on this is at Appendix A.

        Since 20 September 2023, around 1.1 million recipients of JobSeeker Payment and other working age and student payments have been receiving at least a $40 increase a fortnight as a result of the Australian Government's 2023-24 Budget measures.
       </p>

        Regular indexation of certain payment rates, such as JobSeeker Payment and Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA), also occurred on this date, meaning eligible recipients received both increases at the same time.

        The Australian Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government increased the maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA) by 15 per cent at a cost of around $0.7 billion per year. This is the largest increase to CRA maximum rates in more than 30 years. From September 2023, maximum rates for CRA recipients have increased by up to $41.16 per fortnight, depending on the household type (including both the 15 per cent increase and indexation on 20 September 2023 and 20 March 2024).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CRA is a non-taxable income supplement payable with income support payments, Family Tax Benefit Part A, and veteran's service pensions or income support supplements to eligible Australian individuals and families liable to pay private rent for their principal home. The Government has committed to consider the rates of income support payments at every Budget update and has established the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee to provide advice ahead of every Federal Budget on economic inclusion, including policy settings, systems and structures, and the adequacy, effectiveness, and sustainability of income support payments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An across-the board increase to income support payments would not provide a targeted way of increasing rental affordability.

       <p class="italic">
        CRA is targeted to income recipients in the private rental market. As at September 2023 the majority of income support recipients (60.5 per cent) do not pay rent, with a further 7 per cent supported with public housing.

        The Chair recommends the Australian Government coordinate with the states and territories to freeze rental increases for two years, followed by a limit on rental increases of two per cent every two years. Both freeze and the ongoing limits should be attached to the property, not the specific tenancy or lease. The reference date for the freeze on rental increases should be backdated to avoid rents being increased in anticipation of the restrictions. The freeze and ongoing cap should apply to new properties where starting rents are set at the median rent for the area and property type.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government acknowledges that renters are facing significant challenges.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The regulation of residential tenancies, including rental agreements and pricing, is the responsibility of state and territory governments. On 16 August 2023, National Cabinet agreed to A Better Deal for Renters, which includes developing a nationally consistent policy to require genuine reasonable grounds for eviction, moving towards limiting rental increases to once a year and phasing in minimum rental standards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is strong consensus in academic literature on the negative impacts of rent freezes as they reduce both the quantity and quality of housing available in the market, making it harder for tenants to secure housing that meets their needs. In a similar vein, evidence from academic literature on rent caps suggests unintended consequences for renters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Achieving the policy objectives of rental price intervention is difficult as it limits labour market mobility, is inequitable, imposes negative externalities, negatively affects the quality of rental stock, imposes costs on future renters and leads to a reduction in rental supply and increases in rental costs, leaving many renters worse off in the long term. For example, San Francisco's rent caps were found to have resulted in a number of landlords either moving into the properties themselves or selling them. This reduced the supply of available rental stock by 15 per cent and led to a 5.1 per cent increase in overall rent prices over the next twenty years—creating an overall rise in rents of $2.9 billion that was paid for by current and future tenants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The most effective way to sustainably increase rental affordability is to increase housing supply and the Australian Government has committed to several measures aimed at boosting supply as part of its housing reform agenda. Further information is at Appendix A.

In its response to the Privacy Act Review Report, the Australian Government agreed-in-principle to remove the small business exemption, subject to further consultation with small businesses and their representatives on the impact of removing the small business exemption. This would inform consideration of what privacy obligations should be modified for small businesses to ease regulatory burden and what supports small businesses will need to comply with new privacy obligations. The Australian Government also agreed in-principle that in the shorter term, small businesses which engage in activities that pose a significant privacy risk should no longer be able to rely on the small business exemption.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is strong consensus in academic literature on the negative impacts of rent freezes as they reduce both the quantity and quality of housing available in the market, making it harder for tenants to secure housing that meets their needs. In a similar vein, evidence from academic literature on rent caps suggests unintended consequences for renters. Achieving the policy objectives of rental price intervention is difficult as it limits labour market mobility, is inequitable, imposes negative externalities, negatively affects the quality of rental stock, imposes costs on future renters and leads to a reduction in rental supply and increase to rental costs, making many renters worse off in the long term.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1   The Committee recommends that instead of the Senate proceeding with the Bill, the Government introduce a Bill to provide for a consistent floor of two seats for both the Northern Territory and the

        </a>
        . As a consequence, the 2004 margin of error rule for the Territories should be repealed to provide consistency with the formula applying to the States. It further recommends that as part of a new Bill, the two Territories should also be subject to the same rules as each other in the process of redistributing boundaries between electorates, under Part

        The Government notes the recommendation. Given the passage of time, a substantive government response is no longer appropriate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2   The Committee recommends that the Government review the existing provision of additional resourcing to MPs with large electorates, and consider whether further targeted resourcing would assist with representation by MPs of their constituents in these large electorates.    Refer to recommendation 1.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3   The Committee recommends that if the Parliament does not enact a two seat floor for the Territories, it considers instead either:

       <p class="italic">
        enacting a harmonic mean for allocating seats between

        The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report: Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports Amendment (Animal Welfare) Bill 2023, tabled on 30 August 2023.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Animal welfare is important to the Australian community, which expects robust oversight, accountability and transparency of animal welfare in livestock exports.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inspector" rel="nofollow">
         The Inspector
        </a>
        - General of Live Animal Exports Amendment (Animal Welfare) Bill 2023 reinforces the government's commitment to strengthening animal welfare by expanding the current office of the Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports to provide enhanced focus on animal welfare.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill, together with the funding that we have already committed through the October 2022-23 Budget to expand this office, delivers on our 2022 election commitment. The additional objects and functions proposed in this Bill will help to increase oversight, accountability and transparency for animal welfare in exported livestock, and delivers on the government's commitment to strengthening animal welfare.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government's response to the report is set out below. The response addresses the recommendation of the Committee and the additional comments provided by the Australian Greens Senators.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill should be amended to provide that the Inspector-General has oversight of all Commonwealth Government regulation of animal welfare.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill already provides for the oversight of animal welfare regulation by the Commonwealth where it has clear responsibilities regarding the export of live animals. Expanding its scope risks duplicating existing requirements detailed in various other legislation and policies at the state, territory and Commonwealth level with the attendant risks of obsolescence, inconsistency or unintended legislative consequences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is noted that the Australian Greens additional comments reference the domestic harvesting of kangaroos for commercial purposes, which is a clear state and territory responsibility. The government has been careful to ensure that this Bill clearly relates to Commonwealth statutory responsibilities and functions under the

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill should be amended to recognise animal sentience in law.

       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Promoting or recognising animal sentience within Commonwealth law and practice is not appropriate for this Bill or a suitable role for an Inspector-General. The core role of the Inspector-General will be to monitor, investigate and report on the development of animal welfare standards and the implementation of live animal export legislation. The role is one of assuring the Commonwealth's livestock exports systems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill should be amended to require that the Inspector-General have expertise in animal welfare science, animal welfare law, or animal welfare policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The role of the Inspector-General is to oversee the regulator. The key responsibility of the Inspector-General is to monitor, investigate and report on the development of animal welfare standards and the implementation of live animal export legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In doing so, the Inspector-General plays a critical function in promoting continual improvements in the regulatory practice, performance and culture of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Fisheries and Forestry in its role as the regulator of animal welfare and export legislation and standards in relation to the export of livestock.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is entirely consistent with how other Inspector-General legislation operates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is not considered appropriate for primary legislation to place prescriptive constraints on the qualification of the Inspector-General, because it may unnecessarily hinder the selection process for the most suitable candidate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A full selection process will be undertaken to appoint the new Inspector-General. This process is intended to find a person who has suitable qualifications, experience and expertise in both animal welfare and live animal export regulation. Public consultation indicated that post-graduate veterinary or animal welfare science qualifications, in addition to relevant industry experience and professional memberships, are desirable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If, however, the Inspector-General judged it necessary or appropriate, specialist expertise may be engaged to provide any additional expertise required.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill explicitly provides that the Inspector-General may consult relevant experts to assist in the performance of the Inspector-General's duties. This ensures that the Inspector- General has the means to seek expertise where it is judged necessary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill should be amended to require the Inspector-General to disclose any conflicts of interest that conflict or could conflict with the proper performance of their functions.

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the arrangements already in place in legislation, officials of a Commonwealth entity—who have a material personal interest in the affairs of an entity—must positively disclose details of the interest.
