         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d)
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The information sought is not readily available, and an unreasonable amount of departmental resources would be required to develop a response.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) (a) and (b)
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Defence has 72 major bases, and the budget to run and maintain them was approximately
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         $1.3 billion in 2011-12 (this does not include provision of office plants which are provided under local arrangement in some locations). In 2012-13, the budget allocated to running and maintaining Defence bases is around $1.0 billion.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The budget to run and maintain Defence facilities includes utilities (power, water etc), estate maintenance (repairs and minor upgrades but not major capital facilities projects), and garrison support such as cleaning, grounds maintenance, waste management, and pest and vermin inspection/advisory services.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) There is not one single organisation contracted to supply plants to Departmental and agency offices.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4,5,6) The information sought is not readily available, and an unreasonable amount of Departmental resources would be required to develop a response.
