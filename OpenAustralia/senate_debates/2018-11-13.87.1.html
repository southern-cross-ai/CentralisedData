         Senator Williams, I can. Thank you very much for your advocacy for our agricultural communities. I do note that your home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         is 100 per cent drought affected. This is one of the worst droughts affecting regional Australia in our history. I note that 70 per cent of Queensland has been drought affected for over six years, most critically in the western areas where 66 per cent of our national beef herd is sourced, but it has been moving south. Rainfall deficiencies have also increased in the agricultural districts of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . Compared with other areas, for the January to October periods since 1900 year to date, rainfall has been the third lowest on record for the Murray-Darling Basin, the fourth lowest for New South Wales and the eighth lowest for Victoria.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are committed, as a government, to standing with not just our farmers but the drought-affected communities. On 26 October, the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, hosted a national drought summit. The national drought summit put our national leaders, key stakeholders and organisations together to talk about actions, deliver assistance, cut red tape and tackle the gaps that need addressing. It was a sign of the severity of the drought that each premier of our nation was actually there to stand with key stakeholders, regional communities and agricultural experts to look at how we best, as a nation, come together to address the drought.
        </p>
        <p>
         When it comes to the Drought Communities Program, initially we had $75 million provided in initial support for $1 million for each of the 60 affected councils. As a result of the drought summit, and me reassessing the data, we've been able to extend that to another 21 councils, 17 of which are in South Australia. This is a program where local councils will use that $1 million to ensure that they not only employ locally for projects but, importantly, source the materials locally to keep small businesses alive and thriving in those affected communities.

            There are some fantastic examples of how local councils in drought-affected areas are using the Drought Community Program funds to invest locally and improve vital infrastructure but also stimulate the local economy and support local jobs. As the drought continues, it's not just our farmers that are affected, but, increasingly, it is the regional towns and small businesses that we want to survive and thrive when the rains actually come. The Tambo regional council will be undertaking up to eight different projects across their region to improve and upgrade their local facilities and amenities that will promote employment and economic development. Similarly,

            have been approved to start construction of a desalination plant in Ilfracombe. This will secure a sustainable water source for the community of Ilfracombe, which is experiencing prolonged drought. Finally, when I was in Franklin Harbour in

            over the break, I was able to meet Jaz, a local drought support officer—other employment opportunities that affected councils can use this money for.

               Unfortunately, there is. It comes from those on the other side of the chamber. I remain concerned that, despite the personal explanation by Senator Cameron yesterday, there doesn't seem to be a real understanding of the challenge of the drought from those on the other side. Farmers and regional communities across the nation are suffering, with families experiencing real financial hardship and emotional hardship. Small businesses in regional towns are struggling to pay the bills and keep people employed. We want to see those small businesses thrive, because, when the rain comes and the drought breaks, our farmers and our agricultural industry needs thriving regional communities to build the recovery. The government understands the challenges of regional Australia. We stand with our farmers. We stand shoulder to shoulder with affected communities until those essential rains come.
