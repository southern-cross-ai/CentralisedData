           It is a pity that Senator Bob Brown had not sought further information about the procedures of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
            Public Works
           </a>
           Committee. It has always been the case, under any government, that normally, by general agreement, the buildings and operations of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
            ASIO

           and

            ASIS

           , some of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
            AFP
           </a>
           work and some other functions of the Attorney-General’s Department have not been subject to scrutiny or have been exempt from scrutiny because of the very nature of their work. Therefore we do not have very detailed briefings on that nor do we have site inspections because they are normally granted exemption. So for Senator Brown to be putting up this motion is quite ill advised, in my view, and the amendment that he has made is even more ill advised, because it is my understanding that the contents of this letter, which is a confidential letter, have been published in the
           <i>

           </i>
           with the identifying particulars removed in any case. So for Senator Brown to bring this before the Senate is very ill advised and quite ignorant of the procedures of the Public Works Committee.

                 Of course there is not, and that was another example of a failure to understand how this place works. This is a Senate chamber in the Australian democracy and its job is to get information and to make decisions based on that information. Here we have an
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                  ASIO

                 headquarters building with the secret service upfront wanting to grandstand on
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Burley_Griffin" rel="nofollow">
                  Lake Burley Griffin
                 </a>
                 with its building as a monument—to the spying agency in Australia, which we need and agree to. But it is seeking a different form of review—that is, no review—of its place within the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Triangle" rel="nofollow">
                  Parliamentary Triangle
                 </a>
                 . It is our job, and there has been a furore about this in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
                  ACT
                 </a>
                 , to get information and make sure we are acquainted with this building and how it fits in with the architecture of this great city. What Senator Troeth and presumably other colleagues are saying is, ‘No, ASIO is exempted from the purview and the scrutiny of the Senate.’ That is a fundamental failure to understand the role of democracy. We are in charge here, not the secret service agents, and if they want to put a building at the forefront of this city it should be under the scrutiny of this parliament and this Senate. It is an abrogation of duty for the opposition or the government to say otherwise.
