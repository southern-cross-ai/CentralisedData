       <p>
        On Friday, 9 June at midday, a shocking and terrible accident happened in my home town of Ravenshoe. Ravenshoe is a small community—less than a thousand people—just west of Cairns. It is the town that I grew up in. It is a close community; everyone naturally knows each other. That is why the accident has affected the residents of Ravenshoe and the region so significantly. I am sure that all senators are aware of the circumstances of what occurred at the Serves You Right Cafe, so I do not need to go over that here.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I do want to confirm that this was a tragic accident with devastating impacts. At least 21 people were physically injured, with burns being the most critical injury received. Following the explosion, patients were transported to Atherton, Cairns, Innisfail, Townsville and Brisbane hospitals. Due to the severity of their injuries, more of the patients have been subsequently transferred to the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Friday, Ravenshoe lost a much loved wife, mother and daughter, Nicole Dempsey. Nicole was managing the cafe while her parents were having a much deserved holiday. Nicole was a talented netballer and had served as the president of the Cairns Netball Association. She was much loved in our community, and our thoughts are with her family during this dreadful time. Then on Saturday we woke to more bad news, hearing of the passing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Clark" rel="nofollow">
         Margaret Clark
        </a>
        . Margaret is remembered as a true and loyal community member in the tiny neighbouring town of Innot Hot Springs. She was a valued member of the Innot Hot Springs Progress Association and the rural fire brigade. Again, our thoughts are with her, her friends and her family.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Ravenshoe and district are steeling themselves for more bad news and more sadness; we are also hanging onto hope that there is not. There are a number of patients who are currently on life support in induced comas. Many are still listed as critical. The wait is difficult and without answers. Truthfully, there may never be full answers to what we want to know, and that will be hard to manage. It is impossible to imagine such a chaotic accident, but I do want to take some time to reflect on what we do know of the amazing response in the minutes, the hours, the days after the accident—and in what will be the weeks, months and years ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ravenshoe people are resourceful. I know that people from local businesses all pitched in, took directions, and responded to cool the victims and cover their burns, in some cases with Gladwrap. I congratulate and thank all those local people who stepped up to the plate. Our ambulance officers and firefighters did everything that they could. In a cruel twist, we know that there are a number of serving firefighters who are also victims of this tragedy, having agreed to go to the cafe for lunch after giving the seniors group training on fire safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the ambos and the firies for your skill and your professionalism in the immediate response to the tragedy. I also thank all of the medical staff in all of those hospitals who have been helping us, who are doing all you can to care for the patients. We are in awe of your commitment and your skill. I thank Councillor Shaaron Linwood, the councillor of the local government area that covers Ravenshoe. I thank the mayor,

        . I thank all of the

         Tablelands Regional Council
        </a>
        staff for everything that you are doing. I thank Priscilla Clare, who is the chair of the Ravenshoe Community Centre, who is working really hard with her committee and supporters, who we thank too. I know that the Ravenshoe Community Centre has become the point where people go to receive support, advice and counselling.
       </p>
       <p>
        To my old friend and schoolmate Henry Condon, who is the principal of Ravenshoe State School, and his staff: I know that you will be caring for the children who will be hurting. I particularly thank the state government public servants of the Department of Communities,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Safety" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Education and Training
        </a>
        for coordinating the ongoing response to provide counselling, practical support and advice. We value your thoughtfulness and caring advice and support. This tragedy will be with us for a long time, and I encourage anyone who is not feeling okay to reach out for support. Yes, we are country people, and, yes, we are strong, but there is no shame in asking for help.
       </p>
       <p>
        The weeks and months ahead will bring challenges and, hopefully, some positive news as well. I encourage the people of Ravenshoe and the district to the use the counselling and support that is available. I am sure that we can get through this if we pull together.
