       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here we are, 346 days since the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban. As we reflect today, more than 59 per cent of the population of Afghanistan is in need of humanitarian assistance. Now is the time for us to reflect, and to examine how it came to this and what we need to do to make sure that this never happens again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our actions in Afghanistan as a nation have led to a dire humanitarian crisis that has seen starvation, an erosion of human rights, and a crackdown on journalism and activists since August of 2021. My office has been contacted by many people desperately trying to get out of Afghanistan. We've heard multiple reports from Afghan people who assisted Australia during our time in Afghanistan who have been injured or killed, or are currently in hiding. This report recaps that, and says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What is most disturbing is that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        knew and reported on the risks … The Taliban Government publicly and repeatedly broadcasted their intentions (and still do) to seek retribution against anyone who worked for the Coalition forces and Foreign Governments, including the Australian Embassy Security Guards, Contractors and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government actively chose to leave people behind. Let me repeat that: after these people dedicated their lives and risked their families' safety and security to support Australian forces in Afghanistan, the previous government, through their incompetence, left those people behind. They knew the harms that would come to civilians who worked for Allied forces. The value of camaraderie and service to our neighbours has not been applied to the Afghan civilians we left behind to face such terrible consequences. Their safety and sanctuary should be the priority of the current government and their repatriation must be prioritised. Given the risks they have taken to protect Australian personnel, it is the very least that the Albanese government could do. The deaths of Australian locally contracted and engaged employees, as quoted in the report, is 'disgraceful'. Their blood is on the hands of the Morrison government, and we must now work to help those we still can and reckon with the damage that has been caused.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        report has highlighted the dire state of a growing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan since the Taliban's takeover. The Brereton report highlighted the consequences of involvement in a war with an unclear purpose and mandate—a strong signal of poor leadership and culture within
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces" rel="nofollow">
         Special Forces
        </a>
        maintained by an ineffective chain of command. We are reminded by this report that war crimes committed by Australian forces in Afghanistan have caused immeasurable grief to families and communities of victims. In acknowledgement of the harms caused by members of the ADF, the Greens committed in the run-up to the election, and remain committed, to establishing a reparation fund for victims and their families.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        will continue to call on the government to apologise to the people of Afghanistan for contributing to the destabilisation of their country.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we consider where to from here, this report and the end of the allied war in Afghanistan present an opportunity to recalibrate and restrategise our defence priorities. For too long we have blindly followed in the shadow of the United States and contributed to destructive war in our own region. Rethinking our relationship with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        and creating an independent defence and foreign policy for Australia will centre us as a country committed to peace, non-violent conflict resolution and the practice of diplomacy among allies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        will continue to fight for war powers legislation which would require every member of parliament to vote to approve the decision to commit Australian forces to a deployment or war overseas, legislation that is supported by the submissions accepted into this report. The power should not remain in the hands of the Prime Minister and his executive but, as with similar democracies abroad, be answerable to the parliament.
