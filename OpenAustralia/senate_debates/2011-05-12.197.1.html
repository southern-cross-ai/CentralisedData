        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, upon notice, on 22 March 2011:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Is the department aware of any problems with the Austroads standards in relation to the way roads are designed, where: (a) the needs of the private automobile user are placed above those of pedestrians or bicyclists; and (b) means of active transport are essentially 'designed out' of the road?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Given Austroads undertakes national strategic research on behalf of Australasian road agencies to promote improved practice, how does Austroads consult with the department (listed by individual work units or agencies)?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) How often are the Austroads standards reviewed?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Who is consulted or included in the review of the design standards?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Are cycling, pedestrian or active transport peak bodies included; if so, how?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Will the Minister undertake to have these groups included in the next review?

        <p>
         The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Austroads road design standards and guidelines have been developed to ensure that the safety of all road users is given equal consideration in the design and construction of roads and road related infrastructure. These standards include guidance on the design and construction of pedestrian and cyclist facilities with a view to ensuring facilities are built fit for purpose according to road type. For example, the facilities that would be provided on urban roads are likely to be different than those provided on remote roads.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There are also a number of Austroads programs that have been specifically targeted at addressing the needs of pedestrians and cyclists, such as a current project to improve the management of cyclists at roundabouts.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The Department is an active member of the Austroads Board and has representatives on most of the Austroads taskforces including Assets, Freight, Network, Registration and Licensing, Safety, and Technology. These taskforces develop work plans and oversee the management of various research programs.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         From time to time, officers of the Department are directly involved in individual Austroads project working groups (either in an advisory or project management capacity).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The suite of Austroads guides including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guide" rel="nofollow">
          The Guide
         </a>
         to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Design" rel="nofollow">
          Road Design
         </a>
         are reviewed, on average, every 5 years.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Various Austroads Taskforces are involved in the review of Austroads guides depending on the matter being reviewed. The Austroads Technology Program Road Design and Review Panel is routinely consulted when changes are made to The Guide to Road Design. The Road Design and Review Panel is a mixture of government and industry representatives including local government and police.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) Road user groups and peak bodies, such as the Australian Bicycle Council, are consulted as appropriate on each project, with involvement determined by each project working group.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) Through its ongoing role in Austroads processes, the Department will ensure that, consistent with Austroads' processes, all relevant user groups will be included in consultation processes for the next review.
