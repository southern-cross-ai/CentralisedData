        Today, I introduce the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_Industry" rel="nofollow">
         Construction Industry
        </a>
        Amendment (Protecting Witnesses) Bill 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill maintains the existing examination powers used by the building industry regulator, Fair Work Building and Construction, to combat unlawful conduct.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The construction industry is a critical sector of the Australian economy. It is the nation's third largest employer with more than one million workers, with many employed in small businesses. It has, regrettably, been affected by unlawful conduct, thuggery and intimidation for too long.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        , and any objective observer, realise that Australia desperately needs a construction industry that is not plagued by lawlessness, intimidation and thuggery, and in which all participants respect the rule of law. It is what one would expect in the twenty-first century.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For this reason, one of this Government's first tasks was to introduce a Bill to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. That Bill was passed by the House of Representatives in December 2013 and is currently before the Senate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The case to re-establish an effective regulator to enforce appropriate laws, to provide sufficient penalties to deter unlawful conduct, and stop the thuggery and lawlessness in this important industry, is a powerful one.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Re-establishing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
         ABCC
        </a>
        and bringing respect for the rule of law back to the building industry remains a priority for this Government. I also reiterate the Government's firm commitment to the advance release of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Building Code
        </a>
        2014 which will be administered by the ABCC.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the Government appreciates that the Senate requires additional time to consider the ABCC Bills.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst this would ordinarily be a matter of scheduling, we need to stop a ticking time bomb from exploding. The compulsory powers in the current legislation to address the culture of silence and intimidation are subject to a sunset clause imposed by the former Labor government. These important powers will no longer be available to the regulator from 1 June 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Accordingly, until the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 are dealt with by the Senate in the coming sitting period, this Bill, the Construction Industry Amendment (Protecting Witnesses) Bill 2015, will extend the period during which the Director of the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate can exercise the agency's compulsory powers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will extend the powers for a further two years. All other aspects of the current legislation are unchanged, including the automatic immunity given to a witness over their evidence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ability to compel a person to provide information is vital to protecting workers and witnesses who dare to stand up to unlawfulness and intimidation and assist the regulator to clean up the industry. The powers also ensure Fair Work Building and Construction is able to carry out its investigations effectively and break down the 'culture of silence' and retribution that exists in the sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill simply extends the existing powers. These kinds of powers are not novel or new. A range of other Commonwealth regulatory bodies have compulsory powers, such as the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
         QC
        </a>
        conducted a review of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and its powers at the request of the former Labor government. He recommended that the compulsory powers be retained because he was satisfied there was still such a level of industrial unlawfulness in the industry that warranted the powers. He also said that, in reality, without such a power some types of contraventions would be almost impossible to prove.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have recently seen the effectiveness of compulsory powers during the investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of the alleged

         ACCC
        </a>
        Chairman Sims and his agency were confronted by the culture of silence and fear of reprisal that is all too often a feature of the building and construction industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Sims said that "the ACCC has only been able to progress the investigation by compelling people to give evidence". Without the ACCC's use of its compulsory powers, the serious wrongdoing alleged could not have been put before the Court.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It remains the case today that law-abiding industry participants have nothing to fear from the continuation of these powers. In fact, as the name of the Bill suggests, the powers will protect those people who do the right thing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill provides for the continuation of arrangements already in place, which have been previously supported by both sides of Parliament and ensure individuals who are brave enough to take a stand against unlawfulness are not stood over and intimidated into silence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to re-establishing the ABCC and returning the rule of law to Australia's construction industry, and this Bill will ensure that there is no break in the existing regulator's ability to investigate unlawfulness until the Senate has had an opportunity to consider the legislation to re-establish the ABCC.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.
