        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. Last Monday the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
         ABC's
        </a>
        <i>

        </i>
        program exposed the appalling conditions experienced by Aerocare workers at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Airport
        </a>
        . Aerocare workers are paid at a rate below the poverty line and forced to work split shifts, often spending 15 hours a day at the airport but receiving as little as seven or eight hours pay. Was the government aware of the appalling conditions facing workers at Sydney Airport before those conditions were exposed on the
        <i>
         7.30
        </i>
        program. If yes, what action has the government taken and if no, why have you taken no action?

         I thank Senator Gallacher for his question. The government is aware of media reports about working conditions for certain workers at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
          Sydney Airport
         </a>
         . As Senator Gallacher has articulated, these workers are engaged under an enterprise agreement between employers and their employer, Aerocare. In other words, they have gone through the negotiating process for the agreement, and they have agreed to the agreement and it has been approved by the Fair Work Commission—it has been approved by the independent Fair Work Commission. I also understand, though, that Aero Care is currently negotiating a new enterprise agreement, and I understand that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Transport Workers Union
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Services Union
         </a>
         are themselves now seeking to cover workers in this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any worker concerned that the terms that have been negotiated in their enterprise agreement, which has been approved by the independent Fair Work Commission, are not being followed should raise their concerns with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Work_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
          Fair Work Ombudsman
         </a>
         , which can then obviously investigate the matter. I am also informed that both Aerocare and the Fair Work Ombudsman are investigating the matters that have been raised in the media reports and considering whether further action is now needed. Again I would say that they are employed under an enterprise agreement that has been agreed between the employees and the employer, but at this point in time they are in the middle of negotiating a new enterprise agreement under which two unions—the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Services Union—are seeking to cover the workers in the agreement.

           Why has the government allowed safety in our imports to be compromised by appallingly poor working conditions?

            Senator Gallacher, I completely reject the premise of your question. Again I go to the terms and conditions under which these employees are employed. They are workers that are engaged under an enterprise agreement that has been agreed between the employees and the employer, Aerocare, and the agreement itself has been approved by the independent Fair Work Commission.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Gallacher, if you were made aware of any concerns in relation to this agreement, and certainly in relation to this particular person that you have raised, I would certainly hope that you have advised them to actually refer this to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Work_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
             Fair Work Ombudsman
            </a>
            . Because, as I have said, I understand that the Fair Work Ombudsman is currently investigating the matters in the media reports.

              <p>
               In relation to the latter half of your question, I would need to take that on notice, which I will, and I will return to you. Again, Senator Gallacher, the point is this: they are employed under an enterprise agreement that has been negotiated between the employer and the employees. They have agreed on the terms and conditions. The enterprise agreement has been approved by the independent Fair Work Commission. If anyone has concerns in relation to whether or not those conditions are being met, they should absolutely raise them with the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Work_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
                Fair Work Ombudsman
               </a>
               . And as I said, I am informed that the Fair Work Ombudsman is currently investigating this matter.
              </p>
              <p>
               But on the broader point of worker exploitation, we have a very comprehensive worker exploitation policy that is going off to a Senate committee, and I would certainly hope that we can seek the support of those on the other side to tackle the exploitation of workers—
