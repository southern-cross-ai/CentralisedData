        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        , Senator Ludwig. What role does the Commonwealth Minister for Health and Ageing have in contributing to, or signing off on, an environ­mental impact assessment for coalmines or coal seam gas projects assessed under Commonwealth legislation and, in particular, has the federal minister for health been involved in any assessments of coal seam gas or expanded coalmines approved by the Commonwealth since December 2007?

         I will need to find a response from the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
          Health and Ageing
         </a>
         to the question that has been raised about coal seam gas. I am not going to hazard a guess or deal with the broad issues around health in response to that question. I am not sure how it fits in under the health portfolio, but it may become plain with the first or second supplementary question. It is clearly a matter that Senator Milne is pursuing. On that basis, I will seek further and better particulars from the minister for health to that particular question.

          I thank the minister for his answer and the indication that the health impacts of coal seam gas are not high on the agenda.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the health impact assessments are not a compulsory part of state based approvals processes and are not part of the Commonwealth process unless the minister advises otherwise, are Australian citizens uninformed of and unprotected from the adverse health impacts of coalmines and coal seam gas projects in which hazardous and carcinogenic chemicals are permitted?

           I partly reject the first proposition that Senator Milne put forward, but it is a sensible course of action that I seek further and better particulars from the minister for health. I think a question such as this deserves a complete answer from the minister to that part of the question which is within her portfolio responsibilities and which the minister is able to respond to and also to identify the areas of responsibility which the administrative orders provide for that minister to have—the responsibilities that are embodied within that question. I am uncertain as to whether all of the issues you have raised in both your primary and your secondary questions fall within that portfolio, but on the basis that you believe they do I will seek additional and further particulars. The parts that fall without that, we will try to make clear—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I thank the minister for taking up the issue and I would like him also to follow up with the minister what action the Commonwealth might take to ensure that health impact statements become a compulsory component of impact assessments of major projects under Commonwealth legislation, especially since France has today moved to ban fracking.

              It is now a little clearer, so with that amount of detail—if my colleagues from the other side could be a little quieter—I might be able to respond. Taking those three in train, I now understand the direction in which you are heading. It is about seeking information on primary health impacts of coal seam gas operations. I will take that back to Minister Roxon and ask her what part of her responsibilities deal with that area. I will seek to get a response for you as early as I am able to.
