           -National government has not only maintained funding but increased funding for financial counselling and financial capability grants. Any financial counselling service that received Commonwealth government funding for financial counselling in 2018 and applied to continue the service will receive at least the same level of funding in 2019. The government's strong budgetary position means that we're able to provide additional funding to a number of organisations for the next 12 months, providing funding certainty and continuity of service for the community.
