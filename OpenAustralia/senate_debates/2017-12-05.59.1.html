        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. I refer to the member for Dawson, Mr Christensen, who yesterday said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have spoken to the Minister for Employment Michaelia Cash and there is confusion over whether or not Labor's amendment would mean small businesses in my electorate ... would have to give back pay, costing them thousands of dollars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given section 135B(2) of Labor's amendments make it clear that the changes apply 'from the commencement day', why did the minister mislead Mr Christensen?

         Just because Senator Cameron says something doesn't make it true.

          If I

           . Whilst I understand why, on the other occasions you've ruled against us on this—and we accept it, even if we disagree—this was a very clear question about a statement as to commencement and retrospectivity. The minister is not talking about that; she is talking about other issues. It is asserted, as in the question, that a statement was made by her to Mr Christensen. We'd like her to answer the question.

             As I was saying, one of the issues with the amendment that was moved by Labor yesterday is that it has absolutely no impact, colleagues, on deals done by big businesses with big unions under which those big businesses are already paying lower penalty rates because of the deals that they have struck.

                Senator Carr, that was the conclusion of the question. The original part of the question also included a quotation from a member in the other place. I have heard Senator Cash addressing part of that as well. I have said also that, while I cannot instruct the minister how to answer the question, I remind the minister of the question. I also remind those opposite that ministers are allowed to address parts of questions as well. Senator Cash.

We on this side will stand up for small business every day of the week.
