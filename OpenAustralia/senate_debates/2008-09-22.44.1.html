       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee has considered the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008 made under subsection 376-260(1) of the
        <i>
         Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

       <p class="italic">
        Sub-rule 12(1) of this instrument permits the Minister to terminate the appointment of a Board member for ‘misbehaviour’. The scope of this term is not defined and the sub-rule thus appears to give the Minister a very broad discretion. Similarly, it is not clear what rights of review or appeal a Board member has against such a decision. The Committee therefore seeks your advice as to the intended operation of this provision.

        Dear Senator
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 20 March 2008 concerning the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008 (the Rules). I appreciate your letter and regret the time it has taken to reply.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances (the Committee) raised the issue of the intended operation of sub-rule 12(1) of the Rules.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The issue specifically relates to “misbehaviour” as grounds for the Minister to terminate the appointment of a Board member and the rights of review or appeal should the Minister decide to terminate an appointment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am advised that the clause that the Committee has identified is identical to that which is included in a very large number of Acts including the
        <i>
         Australia Council Act 1975, Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973, Australian National Maritime Act 1990, National Gallery Act 1975, National Library Act 1960,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum" rel="nofollow">
          National Museum
         </a>
         of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Act
         </a>
         1980, Screen Australia Act 2008
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         National Film and Sound Archive Act 2008.
        </i>
        An identical clause is found in many pieces of delegated legislation, for example the Fuel Standards Regulations 2001, the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 and the Australian Radiation and Protection and Nuclear Safety Regulations 1999. I understand that the provision is used so widely that it could be regarded as a standard formulation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The term ‘misbehaviour’ is not defined in the standard formulation on which sub-rule 12(1) is based. Because of the wide variety of circumstances in which misbehaviour may occur there would be considerable difficulty in formulating an adequate definition that covered all possible circumstances. General guidance on the meaning of misbehaviour is given by the judgment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Full Court
        </a>
        of the Federal Court (the Court) in
        <i>
         Vanstone v Clark
        </i>
        [2005] FCAFC 189. In that case the Court held that it was necessary to consider whether misbehaviour affected the capacity of a person to hold the particular office.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Court" rel="nofollow">
         The Court
        </a>
        ’s reasoning in that case would be relevant to any decision under sub-rule 12(1).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The decision to terminate an appointment under sub-rule 12(1) would be governed by the principles of procedural fairness. Procedural fairness would require that a Board member be given notice of a proposed decision to terminate his or her appointment, including the reasons for that decision and provided with a reasonable opportunity to respond. A final decision would need to take into account any response from the Board member.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am advised that the decision to terminate an appointment would be a ‘decision of an administrative character’ taken under an enactment and would therefore be reviewable under the
        <i>
         Administrative Decisions (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Review" rel="nofollow">
          Judicial Review
         </a>
         ) Act 1975
        </i>
        (ADJR Act). A Board member whose appointment had been terminated could apply for review of that decision to the Federal Court or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Magistrates_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Magistrates Court
        </a>
        under the ADJR Act.

       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 22 July 2008 responding to the Committee’s concerns with the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008. The Committee appreciates your advice that members of the Board have a right of review under the
        <i>
         Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1975
        </i>
        of any decision to terminate their appointment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In your response you advised that the provision dealing with a decision to terminate an appointment on the grounds of ‘misbehaviour’ is widely used and found in many Acts that establish Boards. The Committee appreciates your argument but is concerned that the fact that such a provision is widespread does not make it any less of a problem. You directed our attention to a decision by the Federal Court in which it was held that the word ‘misbehaviour’ should be read to mean ‘misbehaviour which affects the capacity of a person to hold a particular office’. Given this clarification of the term, we suggest that the Rules be amended to use the same language as that used by the Court.

        Dear Senator
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 28 August 2008 concerning the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008 (the Rules) and specifically the operation of sub-rule 12(1) of the Rules which relates to “misbehaviour” as grounds for the Minister to terminate the appointment of a Board member.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I note that in response to my letter of 22 July 2008 explaining the operation of sub-rule 12(1), the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has suggested that the sub-rule be amended to use the phrase “misbehaviour which affects the capacity of a person to hold a particular office”.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Film Certification Advisory Board (the Board) fulfils an important role in providing expert advice on film production budgets and administration of the Location and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDV" rel="nofollow">
         PDV
        </a>
        Offsets. The government and the Australian public need to have confidence in the integrity of the Board members. Past experience shows that misbehaviour can arise in a wide variety of situations, both in and out of office. Unethical behaviour outside of office, which might be unrelated to a member’s technical capacity to perform his or her duties, nonetheless can raise serious questions which ultimately go to the integrity of the Board’s decision making.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I understand that the suggested amendment is based on the conclusion of the Federal Court in
        <i>
         Vanstone v Clarke
        </i>
        that misbehaviour is connected to a person’s capacity to hold a particular office. In that context the court was considering a reference to misbehaviour without any further qualifications such as you have suggested. Based on advice from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government_Solicitor" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government Solicitor
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGS" rel="nofollow">
         AGS
        </a>
        ), I understand that amending the Rules as suggested could have inadvertent and undesirable consequences. The amended provision could be given an unduly narrow interpretation by a court. In particular there would be a question as to my capacity to act in respect of “misbehaviour” that does not directly relate to a member’s capacity to provide expert advice on film production budgets and other related issues but which goes to broader considerations that could reasonably raise issues of general suitability to hold a particular office. These issues could include, for example, criminal conduct or fraud. Such conduct would undermine the credibility of the Board and its ability to effectively perform its functions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As I have previously indicated, the form of words in sub-rule 12(1) is widely used and is generally regarded as a standard formulation for an extensive range of Commonwealth advisory and statutory boards. The standard formulation clearly applies to misbehaviour, both inside and outside of office, which would call into question the integrity of the member and the member’s continued suitability to hold the office. For this reason, and also for reasons of consistency, it is desirable that a regulation should be based on a model that has been extensively used in Commonwealth legislation. The standard formulation also provides a Minister with the capacity to act where appropriate, which is balanced by the principles of procedural fairness and other administrative law principles to protect a member’s rights. Legal advice to my Department from the AGS confirms this view.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        and the Australian public need to have confidence in the integrity of the Board members. I would hope never to have to take action in respect of sub-rule 12(1). However, in the event a member’s behaviour is such that it adversely impacts on that member’s ability to provide independent expert advice on relevant matters, or adversely affects the ability of the Board to effectively perform its functions, I would not wish to be constrained in my ability to terminate that member’s appointment.

        I refer to the Student Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) Determination 2008 made under paragraph 35(1)(a) of the

        Paragraph 10(c) of this Determination permits relevant information to be disclosed if it is necessary to brief a Minister in relation to issues that are, or will be, raised publicly by the person to whom the relevant information relates, so that the Minister can correct, amongst other things, “an incorrectly held opinion”. It is not clear what this expression means. Other expressions used in the same paragraph refer to correcting matters about which there can be an objective assessment, such as a ‘mistake of fact’ or a ‘misleading statement’. It is not clear how an opinion can be ‘incorrectly held’. The Committee therefore seeks clarification on the intended meaning of this term. The Committee also seeks your advice on whether any safeguards are available where information generally is disclosed or becomes public (for example, is the person affected informed that disclosure has taken place?)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 18 August 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination.

        Dear Senator Wortley

        Thank you for your letter of 19 June 2008 concerning the
        <i>
         Student Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines (the Guidelines)) Determination 2008,
        </i>
        made under paragraph 35(1)(a) of the

        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In your letter you refer to Paragraphs 10 and 11(c) of this Determination and seek clarification of the wording in the Guidelines of the phrase ‘an incorrectly held opinion’─specifically the intended meaning of this term and the safeguards around the disclosure of personal information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The relevant provision the Senate Committee has raised was replicated in the
        <i>
         Social Security (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (

         </a>
         ) Determination 2008
        </i>
        from previous instruments. The provision has been included in the former Departments of Employment and Workplace Relations (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEWR" rel="nofollow">
         DEWR
        </a>

         DEST
        </a>
        ) and Family and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaCSIA) instruments since 2006 and is currently contained in the following determinations:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Social Security (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) (DEEWR) Determination 2008

        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The provision was originally included in the social security guidelines as the result of a request from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>

        </a>
        ) seeking the capacity to disclose protected information should it be necessary to brief the Minister for Human Services on matters that arise in the public arena in relation to social security payments which may require clarification.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The intention of this provision is to capture the situation where an opinion in the public arena is based on misinformation or lack of information, or a misunderstanding of a situation, and it is considered that the opinion is therefore incorrectly formed and held because it has been formed on a false or incorrect premise. Where this occurs it is appropriate that the Minister be briefed to ensure he or she can properly respond to the incorrectly held opinion that may impact negatively on the integrity of the social security system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to safeguards for the disclosure of information, information will not be disclosed unless it is certified by the Secretary (or the delegate where appropriate) that the disclosure is in the public interest in accordance with the
        <i>
         Student Assistance (Public Interest Certificate Guidelines) Determination 2008.
        </i>
        In each circumstance the Secretary (or delegate) will have regard to the circumstances and the information that is to be disclosed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The clarification for the disclosure of information is provided in the Guidelines, specifically under Sections 10 Mistake of fact and under Section 11 Ministerial briefing.
       </p>

        I hope this information is of assistance to the Committee.

        In your response you advise that the provision ‘an incorrectly held opinion’ is intended to refer to the situation where opinions are formed on the basis of incorrect information.

        In your letter, you note that the Guidelines should be clearer on the point that an incorrectly held opinion is an opinion formed on the basis of incorrect information. I have reviewed paragraph 10(c) of the Guidelines and am of the view that the words ‘or an incorrectly held opinion’ should be removed. The words ‘correcting a mistake of fact, a misleading perception or impression, [or] a misleading statement’ will cover the circumstance that an opinion is held on the basis of incorrect information.

        Each of these Determinations specifies guidelines for the exercise of the power of the Secretary of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to disclose information when it is in the public interest to do so. Section 11 in each instrument states that information may be disclosed for the purposes of Ministerial briefings. Subsection 11(c) in each instrument states that this is permissible in relation to issues raised, or proposed to be raised, publicly by or on behalf of the person to whom the information relates, so that the Minister can respond by correcting, amongst other things, “an incorrectly held opinion”. It is not clear what this expression means. Other expressions used in the same paragraph refer to correcting matters about which there can be an objective assessment, such as a ‘mistake of fact’ or a ‘misleading statement’.

        I also seek leave to make a short statement about a matter that arose during the committee’s consideration of the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 24 June this year the Regulations and Ordinances Committee gave notice of a motion to disallow the Film Certification Advisory Board Rules 2008. One of the provisions in this instrument permitted the minister to terminate the appointment of a board member for misbehaviour. The scope of this term was not defined and seemed to give the minister a very broad discretion to dismiss. The committee sought advice on this issue as well on the availability of review rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        The minister responded that this provision was, essentially, a standard term used throughout much Commonwealth legislation. However, some general guidance on its interpretation could be found in the Federal Court decision in Vanstone v Clark. In that case, the court held that it was necessary to consider whether the misbehaviour affected the capacity of the person to hold the particular office. Given this clarification, the committee thought that it would be helpful if these rules were amended to use the same language as that used by the court. In other words, the minister would have a discretion to terminate an appointment for misbehaviour which affects the capacity of a board member to hold office. The minister responded that advice from the Australian Government Solicitor suggested that such an amendment could have ‘inadvertent and undesirable consequences’. For example, it could be given an unduly narrow interpretation by the courts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The time for resolving this disallowance notice has run out, and the committee has today given notice of its intention to remove the notice. It is decided to remove it because what we face is a general issue of legislative drafting rather than a problem with a specific provision. In addition, to disallow this provision would simply remove the minister’s right to terminate an appointment, which is not a desirable consequence. However, because the issue is a general one, an issue of consistency in legislative drafting, the committee will seek the advice of the Attorney-General, the Australian Government Solicitor and the legis

          I thought it was worth me speaking briefly to the notice of motion for the chamber’s benefit. It provides that the Senate will sit on Tuesday until 11 pm and, in addition, on Thursday until 11 pm, plus the usual 40-minute adjournment. Then the Senate will suspend and sit on Friday. I thought it was worth providing that quick overview to the Senate today. I have given notice of this motion. We can have further discussions on this today and tomorrow when it comes up. At the moment it is being circulated and we are seeking comment from the opposition, the minor parties and Independents about how we proceed. The government is serious about achieving legislation this week, and we can entertain discussions about how we proceed this week. This notice of motion is effectively a protective notice of motion so that we can use the time between now and tomorrow to confirm this notice or, alternatively, come to a mutually agreeable position on what the hours should be to ensure that we do sit. I thought it was helpful to inform the Senate that the government’s intention is to deal with the luxury car tax, and there may be other bills that need to be passed this week to ensure that they can commence. I also wanted to provide notice to the Senate that we will be sitting late on Tuesday and on Thursday and possibly on Friday as well.

            by leave—The leaders and whips idea may be a good one to pursue. I can foresee more of this coming down the line. I want to reiterate the Greens position on sitting Fridays. If it becomes necessary to sit on Fridays, we would expect that would mean Thursday night did not cope and Friday is going to be a fairly full sitting. We believe that under those circumstances there should be a question time. If it is important enough for the Senate to sit, it is important enough for a question time so that the urgent, important other matters of the day can be taken into account.
