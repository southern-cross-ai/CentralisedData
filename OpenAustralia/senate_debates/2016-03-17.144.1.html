        I am pleased to table this report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee into mental health of

        members and veterans. The government, opposition, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        senators worked cooperatively during the inquiry and I am pleased to report that the majority report's recommendations have broad cross-party support.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has a deep respect for those Australians who serve and protect our country, putting their life, as well as their physical and mental health, on the line. This report examines the prevalence of mental ill health and the impact that ADF service can have on the mental health of its members and veterans, as well as the services available to support ADF members and veterans struggling with mental ill health.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a terrible tragedy whenever any ADF member loses their life during their service; however, when a member or veteran dies as a result of suicide it is particularly devastating for the family, friends, and colleagues of the deceased member.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2000, more than 100 ADF members are suspected or have been confirmed to have died as a result of suicide. Suicide claims the lives of many veterans as well; however, it is difficult to determine the number of veterans who have died as a result of suicide.
       </p>
       <p>
        In general, the committee has been satisfied that ADF members' access to mental health services is adequate, provided the member is willing to seek treatment. However, evidence received by the committee of ADF members who were brave enough to report mental ill-health and seek treatment being ostracised, ridiculed, and accused of 'malingering' was deeply disturbing and completely unacceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has made a number of recommendations to Defence,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        and the Commonwealth government more broadly. The recommendations focus on:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Early identification and treatment of mental ill-health is crucial for ADF members and veterans struggling with mental ill-health to achieve the best possible outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mental ill-health in veterans may go unrecognised and undiagnosed for many years after leaving the ADF. Whilst it is true that engagement with DVA must be initiated by the veteran, more must be done to encourage veterans to seek assistance early and to make the process for seeking assistance simple and swift.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a terrible failing that we as a community do not know how many of our veterans are struggling with mental ill-health. More must be done to ensure continuity of identification of veterans, regardless of whether they are clients of DVA. All veterans should be provided with a universal identification number and identification card that can be linked to the veteran's service and medical records and utilised by both Defence and DVA, as well as other government and community services.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee commends
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Lifecare for its Homes for Heroes Program and for the work of its founder, Mr Geoff Evans, helping veterans who are homeless and struggling with mental ill-health. Despite being in its early stages, the program's 'housing first approach' and focus on ongoing psychosocial support for veterans appears to be achieving excellent results at minimum cost.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the report to the Senate.
