        , Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Evans. Can the minister please outline to the Senate the government's view on the long-term potential for job growth in Australia? Can the minister also indicate the economic challenges that may be having an impact on jobs in the short term?

         I thank Senator Furner for the question and his interest in serious policy issues of interest to the Australian public. The core focus of this Labor government is the creation of high-quality jobs. Our commitment to that is exemplified by the fact that since coming to office Labor has been responsible for a period when we have added three-quarters of a million jobs, and the long-term prospects for jobs remain very strong in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the near term we are facing some considerable challenges most of which are driven by international events. While the short-term global economic outlook is increasingly uncertain, we will be buffeted by those events. The weak growth in the developed world stands in sharp contrast, though, to the extraordinary growth in emerging Asia, which is driving incredible demand for our resources and boosting Australia's national income. Of course, it is also increasing our exchange rate and bringing about a genuine structural adjustment to the Australian economy. All of those factors are having a short-term impact on jobs in Australia and we have seen loss of jobs in some sectors while mining and construction continue to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, as the economy restructures, the long-term potential for jobs growth remains very strong in Australia. The investment pipeline will see jobs continue to be created, and not just in the construction phase of the mining expansion but also permanent high-skilled jobs across many sectors of the economy. In fact, my department projects that over the next five years Australia will see an additional 1.3 million jobs to meet the demands of the economy. That is an extra 1.3 million jobs and opportunities for Australians as the economy continues to grow. So the future for employment in the Australian economy is strong. There will be jobs created and they will be high-quality jobs and opportunities for young Australians.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister outline the sectors that will generate strong jobs growth in future? Can the minister describe the reforms that Labor is undertaking in the tertiary sector to ensure that an Australian workforce can meet the future demands of employers in high-skilled sectors?

            I note Senator Macdonald's interjection about Cairns. If he wants to ask me a serious question about employment in Cairns I would be happy to answer it. But no doubt we will get muckraking as usual from the opposition. What we know is that the sectors experiencing strong jobs growth over the long term will need people with strong tertiary skills. My department's projections indicate that Australia will need around 270,000 extra construction and mining workers to deal with the mining expansion but there will be long-term growth in the services sector and there will be a requirement for us to continue to provide people with tertiary education to feed the jobs in education, business services and the care services. So we will need more doctors, nurses, bankers, scientistsâ€”a whole range of people to fill highly skilled jobs that will need tertiary education. That is why this government's record investment in tertiary education is a key part of supporting the growth in our economy and the jobs of the future.

              This government recognises that the key to long-term productivity growth and greater workforce participation is ensuring that workers have high-quality skills and a high-quality education. That is why, in addition to our investment in schools, we have put over $11 billion into vocational education and training since 2008-09 and we are investing a further $3 billion in skills and training under the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. This package, announced in the budget, focuses on being industry led, working with industry to make sure we are training people in the skills that will get them jobs, partnering with industry to make sure that we meet their needs and that people have the opportunity to take up high-skilled, high-wage jobs in areas that are growing in the economy. Not only is this employment with large companies but it is with small companies and a lot of regional companies. We are investing to make sure that we better match the skills needs of our employers and the opportunities and training of our young people.
