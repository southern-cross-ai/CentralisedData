        My question is to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy
        </a>
        , Senator Conroy. I refer to the non-binding agreement for Telstra to participate in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        . How can the government justify paying $9 billion of taxpayers’ money essentially in exchange for Telstra shutting down its existing business? What are Australian taxpayers actually getting for their $9 billion?

         That is a question that shows that those opposite, as usual, have failed to do basic research, to even read a press release from either Telstra or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         Co. or look on the departmental website. It is very clearly spelled out what is being received in the deal between NBN Co. and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstra_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
          Telstra Corporation
         </a>
         , which is who the contract, the financial heads of agreement, has been signed with. It is a $9 billion deal between NBN Co. and Telstra, and the $9 billion refers to two or three different aspects but the vast bulk of it refers to access to Telstra’s infrastructure—the ability to use existing infrastructure. This will lead to significant savings for the country and, more importantly, it will not lead to the debacle that took place under those opposite with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFC" rel="nofollow">
          HFC
         </a>
         cable, when we had Telstra and Optus trucks driving down the same streets stringing two cables up in front of everybody’s houses, digging everybody’s pavement up twice. That is what actually happened. That sort of duplication was a terrible waste of money for the Australian economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other major aspect of the $9 billion is the commitment to transfer all of Telstra’s customer base onto the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         . That is millions and millions of Telstra customers closing down the copper and moving across onto the fibre network. This is a win-win.

          , I ask a supplementary question. How does the minister defend Labor’s decision to spend another $100 million a year of taxpayers’ money on the universal service obligation—a cost that until now has always been met by the telecommunications industry, not by the taxpayer?

            Yes, they do think they are so clever, Senator Lundy. You are right. Tragically, the way networks work is they are connected together. Pieces of copper connect to pieces of copper; pieces of fibre connect to pieces of fibre. When you restructure the sector, when you pull the copper out of the ground and you close exchanges, what that means is that the copper network that extends out into the 10 per cent needs to be connected to something. The restructure that we are engaged in is described by the
            <i>

                      Order, Senator Conroy. I believe it was at about the 34-second mark. On the point of order, I believe the minister is answering the question. He might not be answering it in the way that is desired, but I cannot tell the minister how to answer the question. I draw the minister’s attention to the fact that there will be 34 seconds left on the clock to answer the question.

We will continue to have the industry levy, but because the structure of the sector is changing—

                         On the question of all talk and no action, let’s be very clear about this: 6,000 kilometres of backhaul is being constructed across Australia right now. In Tasmania the first real customers signed up will go live in just two or three weeks—real customers with a real network that is being built in the ground today. For the first five mainland release sites, construction starts next month. The embarrassment on the other side is that they do not actually understand anything about this sector. They do not understand that the first customers will be connected in Tasmania in a few short weeks.
