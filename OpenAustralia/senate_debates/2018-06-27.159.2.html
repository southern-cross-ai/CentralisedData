              Senator Urquhart, Senator Anning was granted leave to speak for one minute. That was not conditional on it being relevant to a motion. I will remind all senators, and Senator Anning was not in the chamber when I asked this earlier, that the one-minute statements are granted as a courtesy of the Senate and should relate to the matter directly beforehand, rather than necessarily or always the substance of the issue at hand.

               In 2016, the ABS recorded that 2,866 people had committed suicide. Creating a culture that promotes death as a solution can only make this problem worse. Legalised euthanasia is a direct attack on the sanctity of life. I urge the Senate to reject any move that would promote state-sponsored killing of the most vulnerable in society.

We facilitate those one-minute divisionsâ€”

                        Senator Wong, my response to what you raisedâ€”and I did receive your message during that particular countâ€”is that both whips wereâ€”
                       </p>
                       <p>

                        It's a fair point to raise. Both whips were advised and the chamber was advised on numerous occasions that this was to be a one-minute bell because we had had numerous divisions in the lead-up. This motion was actually about the ordering of business at the Senate next time, and I've made the point in the chamber twice today that, when statements are being made on matters on the

                        , they should relate to the motion, not necessarily the substance. This motion was about managing the business of the Senate when we resume in August.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        If any senator in the future would like to flag with me an issue that they think is of enough import that they would insist on a four-minute bell, I am very happy to take that in advance. I was not advised in any way in this case that there would be a request for a longer bell, even on the two occasions when I made the point to the chamber that there would be a one-minute bell. But I take the point. I do rely on advice from senators.

                         . I obviously was not able to be here for all of the divisions leading up to this. I've made the point. It was not simply an ordering of business. It was a substantive motion that brings on a bill which will have a conscience vote for a number of parties and enables debate for three or four days. It was not a minor reordering of the Senate business.
