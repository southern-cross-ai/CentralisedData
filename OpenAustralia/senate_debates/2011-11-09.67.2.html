       <p class="italic">
        How many primary schools do not have specialist music teaching and what are the disadvantages attached to that lack? I ask the minister if he would find out how many primary state schools there are that do not have specialist music educators and which ones they are.

        Question
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        How many specialist music schools are there in Australia?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not hold data on the number of specialist music schools. While a number of states and territories run specialist music schools, the allocation of resources to support special programs, including specialist music schools, is a matter for state and territory education authorities.

       <p class="italic">
        Question
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What are the advantages of an early childhood education in music in terms of the outcomes of education at the other end of schooling?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is considerable evidence that active participation in music education has an effect on the intellectual, social and personal development of children and young people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Evidence for a causal relationship between music training and changes in the brain is provided from longitudinal studies of both children and adults learning music.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While it is never too late to acquire music skills, research suggests that earlier training is likely to be most effective in influencing the development of the brain and behaviour.

        recognises the importance of music education in schools and supports an arts-rich education for all students. Development of an Australian Curriculum for the arts is part of a second phase of work being undertaken by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority and will promote a nationally consistent approach and high quality teaching and learning of music in all of Australia's primary schools.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An initial paper on the Shape of the Australian Curriculum: the Arts was released on 26 August 2011.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shape" rel="nofollow">
         The Shape
        </a>
        paper sets out the intention for all students to experience and study each of the five arts subjects including music from Foundation to the end of primary school.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Curriculum is aligned with the Early Years Learning Framework and builds on its key learning outcomes. In the Early Years Framework, literacy includes a range of modes of communication including music movement, dance, storytelling, visual arts, media and drama, as well as talking, reading and writing.
