         is big. It's beautiful. But it's in danger. But this government doesn't want you to know that. That's why the Greens have initiated this references committee inquiry into the

         's attempted listing of the Great Barrier Reef as 'in danger'. The whole country is talking about

          COP
         </a>
         26. In fact, the whole world is focused on Glasgow and how the international community are going to come together and reduce emissions.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
          If I
         </a>
         had my way, I would commandeer COP26, at least for the first day, and, as a matter of urgent priority, I would have the world look at the latest science on the Great Barrier Reef, the exact science that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
          IPCC
         </a>
         report used, to recommend that the reef be downgraded to 'in danger'. I would recommend that the entire COP26 entourage had an urgent briefing on the Great Barrier Reef and the sad, tragic decline of this world's greatest natural wonder.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is nothing complicated about the tragic decline we have seen in the Great Barrier Reef, particularly in the last decade. We're not talking about numbers here. We're not talking about pathways to net zero by 2050 or what's required by 2030. What we are looking at is a stark reminder of our failure to take climate action. If the world were to see the true state of the Great Barrier Reef and the real science that tells us that the Great Barrier Reef, if we continue along a trajectory of business as usual, will be gone in this century, I believe that would trigger a significant global action, because, if the Great Barrier Reef is in severe decline, that means most of the world's coral reefs are also in that sad decline.

         initiated this inquiry some months ago, and we have brought it here this evening to debate and, if we can, put to a vote. But I understand that is probably not going to be possible. This attempt by the government to deny the science, to put politics above the science, to postpone the inevitable—and we all know the Great Barrier Reef is in danger—must be exposed. The government's excuses, their deceptions and, in fact, I would say their downright lies, their panic, when the World Heritage Committee apparently blindsided them by saying they were going to list the Great Barrier Reef as 'in danger'—this august chamber needs to look at the process. It needs to look at why UNESCO was going to list the reef as 'in danger' and the science behind that. We need to speak to the experts. But we also need to look at the government's reasons. How were the government blindsided, when UNESCO has been talking about this potential downgrade for nearly 10 years? How were they blindsided when they allocated—
