        by leave—As I understand it, where we are now is with the last remaining motions about the chamber management for the remainder of the day. The government’s preference in relation to this is to continue to pursue the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
        </a>
        . We want to amend Senator Xenophon’s motion to try to achieve that and we do want to press that with a division. However, having had extensive consultation around this chamber, we do understand that the numbers are, in fact, against us in relation to this matter. We do understand that we will not be able to achieve that. We do then have to consider what our next position will be in foreshadowing that next position. It is a way of at least trying to manage the remaining time that we have available. The time, everyone rightly has pointed out, is slipping away from us.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next position we would seek is support for a motion which would deal with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in August. That would be the sensible course of action because we want to be able to conclude the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is a matter that the Rudd government took to the election. We do want a cap-and-trade system in place. We do want the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme finalised. That motion would give us the opportunity to do just that in August. It is not our best or preferred position; however, I foreshadow that that will be our course of action. The government will then seek to move a motion to deal with the hours for the remainder of the day, so that we can finalise those bills that are required to be dealt with before the winter recess.

             I thank my colleague for that. It has always been the coalition’s position to continue the debate on the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
              CPRS
             </a>
             , if we have considered the bills deemed urgent and requested as being urgent by the government. We are facilitating this today. We are very happy to return to the CPRS at any stage when these bills have been finished. We have negotiated with the government, once again, to give up our general business for today to facilitate the urgent bills that the government have requested. We believe progress was made yesterday with those bills. If there is time permitting today and if the government want to go back to the CPRS, we are comfortable with doing that within hours that the Senate sits.

                       will be moving to add to the schedule of business the Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Bill 2009 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008. That being said, we see the priority the government has on the climate change legislation in this chamber and it ought to be determined in the sitting. We are not in favour of the idea that there can be no limit put on that debate or no resolution gained now but that, magically, in August we can.

                      <p>
                       What is more, we can see forward to August, in some way or other, and decide there will be a guillotine in place at the end of the first week in August. Yet apparently the House cannot decide to do that this week. We will be moving to support the government—if it holds its resolve, and it appears to be crumbling—to have the climate change legislation dealt with and brought to resolution. We will not be supporting a failure to do that now and the long-range view that that ought to be imposed in August. We will wait and see the circumstances in August. We want to see a resolution on this matter, but we are not going to commit to something in August that the other parties in this place seem not able to commit to right now.

                            I want to make a couple of comments about Senator Parry’s contribution, which was, whether intentional or otherwise, really quite inaccurate. He claimed that the opposition was happy to debate the

                            . Anybody who has watched or was in this chamber at the beginning of the week will know that those opposite have thrown all their resources, every procedural and political game, every aspect of their strategy, at not having a vote. That is their position on climate change this week. ‘We are going to fight really hard to not have a vote.’ That has been their position. I want to pay some tribute to Senator Joyce because at least he was honest about this. At least he went out and said—

                               As I was saying, I pay tribute to Senator Joyce, who at least was honest. He went out to the Australian people and said, ‘We are going to filibuster and delay.’ But Senator Parry, after doing what he has done as whip this week and what others have done—delayed this vote by every tactic and strategy they have—comes in here and says, ‘Actually, it is Thursday morning, we are prepared to debate it,’ has to count as one of the most hypocritical contributions this chamber has seen.

                               I just would say this. I saw a newspaper article where Senator Bernardi was saying that the Liberal Party should stand up for its principles. Well, what are those principles? Because this week those principles have been the high and lofty principles of avoiding and ducking a vote on climate change.

                                       As I understand it, Senator Brown’s motion includes Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Bill 2009, which I withdrew earlier. In addition, the part in the centre would be the motion I foreshadowed we may be left with. If Senator Brown were amenable to removing the paragraph beginning with ‘Migration Amendment’ and ending with ‘Representatives’ then we would have an amendment that would reflect what we can continue on to do. If not, the government would oppose that on the basis that we have not had a discussion about this particular matter.

I do not want to go through the content of my previous statement again, except to say that the Greens will not be supporting this motion because we believe we should not be setting the sitting agenda schedule and outcomes for the first week of the sitting after the winter break. We should be dealing with these matters now. If we have to have further inquiries into the climate change legislation, who knows how many more will be required when we come back after August? We think this is bad process. What is effectively happening here is that the opposition is getting some control of the scheduling in the Senate, and it is the wrong direction to go in.

                                             I thank the Senate. As I was saying, the government has been consistent in its determination to have this bill discussed and debated this week. We have been frustrated at every opportunity by the procedural tactics, delaying tactics and irresponsibility of the opposition. The benefit in this promotion from Senator Xenophon is that it brings down the bar on your filibustering and your delay because what it makes clear—

The government’s view is that, given the behaviour of the opposition this week and the fact that the government have not had the majority in this chamber for debate, we want to bring down the boom on the filibustering, the delaying tactics and the avoidance of a vote on the other side.

We will use every minute of every day to try and convince the Australian people to go on that journey, to clearly explain what happens to our economy if this thing were ever to come into place. If this thing ever comes into place, it is regional Australia—your seats, Labor seats—that will get flushed down the toilet. You do not care about that—and all for a gesture; all for a gesture that does absolutely nothing for our environment but does everything for your ego.

There are budget measures, appropriations bills, and they need to be passed. I ask this question: what would have happened if we had not provided time for these bills to be debated?

He thinks he can avoid having to face up to the massive divisions on that side of the chamber on this bill. If you are so concerned, bring it on; have the vote. It really is quite embarrassing to watch the contortions you are going through in embarrassing yourself to protect your colleagues. Let the sceptics loose; let them out! Let’s have the vote. Let Barnaby have his vote. You want debate; you want a vote: bring it on!

That goes with being a minority government in this chamber. We put up with that for nine of our 11 years in government. We know exactly the frustration that Senator Evans is experiencing. We experienced it at the hands of the Labor opposition for nine of those 11 years. They did all they could to frustrate us in our endeavours to take legislation through this place.

As soon as members of the government shut up, we can get on with those bills. We believe there is ample time to deal with those bills today. We have had very productive discussions with Senator Ludwig to make sure that occurs. Indeed, we have gone so far as to say that we believe that before six o’clock there may well be the opportunity to return to the second reading debate on the
