        My question is to the Minister representing Minister for the Environment, Senator Birmingham. Last week the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        Marine Park Authority released a position statement recognising that climate change is the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef. It says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Only the strongest and fastest possible action on climate change will reduce the risks and limit the impacts of climate change on the Reef.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also said that 'there is an urgent and critical need to accelerate actions to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions' and that that must happen in parallel with resilience-building actions. Are you going to listen to the pleas from your own agency for genuine, swift action on climate to protect the reef, or are you just going to cut their funding again or give it to some other body to do the job?

         I thank Senator Waters for her question, although not for some of the inaccuracies in some of the statements that she made.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Waters is quite incorrect when it comes to funding in relation the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef
         </a>
         . This government have proudly provided record levels of funding to support the Great Barrier Reef—to ensure its resilience, to invest in its future—and we do that in partnership, where we can, with the Queensland government and other authorities. This government is also proud of the fact that we continue to be, as a nation, on track to meet and exceed our 2020 emissions reduction target, and we're confident that we will meet, and we hope exceed, the 2030 emissions reduction target that Australia has committed to as part of the global effort.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's often overlooked when the Greens ask questions on these topics, but addressing climate change issues requires a concerted global effort. Australia is but one nation in relation to that. We, however, are one nation that can be proud of our record of meeting and exceeding the commitments that we made, and we can be proud of the fact that we will continue, where we make commitments, to meet and exceed those targets. Indeed, our work, in particular our work on Australia's emissions per capita and emissions intensity across our economy, means we are at the lowest emissions level in 29 years as a result of a range of policy efforts that have been made, and that contributes towards Australia's efforts to meet our overall emissions reduction target.

           That didn't really address the first question, but it wouldn't be the first time. The reef narrowly avoided a

            I again point out to Senator Waters that when it comes to decisive climate action, this government plays its role in making commitments on behalf of the nation as one nation amongst many in the world. Our commitments and our actions are those of just one country. In relation to climate action, Australia cannot address this issue in isolation; we do it in partnership, through the Paris agreement. We will meet the targets that we've made in the Paris agreement, which are significant targets in terms of reduction by between 26 per cent and 28 per cent in relation to Australia emissions targets.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to protecting the reef, what we do is we invest record sums to build up the reef's resilience. We address issues in addition to those climate change issues that we work on globally, through the Paris agreement, and we work instead on the resilience issues around matters such as soil run-off and emissions that you get in other ways in terms of the nutrients that flow into the reef that can be of harm. Addressing those helps increase its resilience to a range of threats, including those related to climate change.

                As the tourism industry well knows, as valued partners through the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan, we work with the tourism industry as we work with the Queensland government, traditional owners, industry scientists, farmers—the entire range of partners necessary to build and sustain resilience in the reef and ensure its long-term health as well as to make sure we deliver on our policy commitments in relation to climate change and emissions reduction.

We make sure that people understand that what we are seeking to do as a government is preserve that asset, ensure that asset is there for future generations to visit—not scare them away as the Greens do.
