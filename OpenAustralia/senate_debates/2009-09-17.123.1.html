        My question is to Senator Ludwig, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister indicate to the Senate how many aged-care places were offered as residential in the last round of funding and how many were taken up as residential?

         I thank Senator Williams for that question. I know that he has an interest in this area. On 30 June 2009 the Minister for Health and Ageing announced the results of the 2008-09 aged-care approvals round—

            We keep getting interjections. I am trying to answer Senator Williams’s very important question in relation to aged-care facilities. I am sorry that the opposition do not want to hear the answer to the question that was asked. In annual recurrent funding that money was made available and the 10,447 new aged-care places were allocated. The places include 5,748 new residential aged-care places—two-thirds of them delivering high care—and 4,699 community care places. This government is working with the aged-care area to ensure that we have significant places available as well as recurrent funding.
           </p>
           <p>
            The allocation is a mix of residential and community care places that reflect the changing demands of older Australians. It is not only a question of the number of new aged-care places but—as I am sure the opposition, particular Senator Williams, would understand—about ensuring we provide the right mix of aged-care facilities as Australians age and demographics change within the community. Older Australians tell us that they wish to remain independent in their homes and in their communities.

                  I thank Senator Williams for the question. What I can provide is: in addition to those places, the Rudd government also allocated a record $51 million in capital grants—the largest single capital grant allocation by any Australian government. So what this government is working on is ensuring that we provide aged-care facilities, that we have 10,447 new aged-care places, worth an estimated $347 million in annual recurrent grants—

                     I was going to say that over the period from 1 July 2007 to 31 March 2009 the industry has commenced work on aged-care facilities, with a total value of $2.2 billion. The

                     </a>
                     also conducted an annual survey of aged-care homes. I was going to go on to say, in relation to the other part of the question, that I will be able to take that on notice and provide a further answer to Senator Williams’s question.

                      I have a further supplementary question. Given the ageing population, can the minister explain to the Australian people how the growing list of Australians needing to access aged care will be accommodated in years to come when so many providers are going to the wall and the number of available beds is diminishing?

                       What I can add—in addition to the answer I provided in relation to the 10,447 new aged-care places worth an estimated $347 million in annual recurrent funding made available—is that the Rudd government also allocated a record $51 million in capital grants. That is the largest single capital grant allocation by an Australian government since the Aged Care Act came into effect in 1997. So, in comparison to what the opposition—the previous government—did, this government recognise and are putting work into this area. We are ensuring that there is also a further $4.8 million allocated as community and flexible-care grants. These grants are used to help establish new or extend existing communities and flexible aged-care services. Particular, Senator Williams would be interested to know—
