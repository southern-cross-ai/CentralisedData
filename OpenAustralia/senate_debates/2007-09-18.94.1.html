        I urge the Senate to accept these amendments. The amendments I refer to arise directly from, and are closely aligned to, the precise and detailed recommendations of the May 2007
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights
        </a>
        and

         Equal Opportunity Commission
        </a>
        report
        <i>
         Same-sex: same entitlements
        </i>
        . That was a national inquiry into discrimination against people in same-sex relationships—their financial and work related entitlements and benefits. This is the first tax bill that I could put these amendments to.
       </p>
       <p>
        I draw the attention of the chamber to appendix 1 of that report, which lists 58 acts that need amending to comply with the commission’s finding that inequitable and unjust discrimination applies to tens of thousands of Australians who are in same-sex relationships. I draw the Senate’s attention to the chapter headed ‘Summary of findings and recommendations’—that is chapter 18, on page 371. Within chapter 18, on page 384, you will find a list of items used to determine whether two people are in a de facto relationship and the circumstances taken into account to determine that relationship. Those are replicated in my amendment. Discrimination under tax laws is also described in chapter 18 under ‘Summary of findings and recommendations’. It is described under (c) on page 377: ‘Discrimination under tax laws’.
       </p>
       <p>
        I very much doubt that senators have the report readily to hand, so I will read the section about the discrimination that exists—the homophobic discrimination, might I say—the unjust, totally unwarranted, immoral, disgraceful discrimination that exists under our tax laws against same-sex couples or families. I draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that many people of same-sex persuasion do, in fact, have families—children and, of course, dependants. I will read section (c). Do not despair; it is not so long that it will take forever. The section is headed ‘Discrimination under tax laws’ and says:

       </ul>
       <p>
        Chapter 8 of the report provides much more detail about these and other tax entitlements. This kind of discrimination is not about marital relationships; this is about relationships between people who live together, who have an enduring relationship, which is determined on a very exact basis, and who are not allowed the same tax entitlements as other Australians living in the same circumstances. It is an abomination. It is unacceptable. Now that this report is out, there is no excuse for it not being addressed. There is no political advantage in this to anyone refusing or opposing this. There is just a moral vacuum, a moral failure. I have brought these amendments forward because I think it is time the government addressed them. I do hope that the amendments, which I have designed to comply as close as I can with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HREOC" rel="nofollow">
         HREOC
        </a>
        ’s recommendations, find acceptance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through you, Madam Temporary Chairman: I know, Minister, that the amendments are likely not to be perfect, but the government could always accept them and improve them in the House and then send them back for the agreement of the Senate. I would urge the Senate to accept these amendments and approve them.

         This is not the first occasion in the Senate or, indeed, in the House of Representatives where we have been debating the removal of discrimination as it applies to superannuation provisions in regard to same-sex couples. It is not the first time and, Senator Murray, I have forgotten how many times we have spoken on this matter in the Senate. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Democrats" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Democrats
         </a>
         —and sometimes the Greens, I have to acknowledge—and the Labor Party invariably move amendments time and time again, either in committee or in a second reading debate, that the government remove the discrimination in respect to superannuation provisions as they apply to same-sex couples.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Murray rightly identified a moral failing on the part of the government, but it is actually a double moral failing, because I was here in this Senate chamber about four years ago—Senator Murray would recall—when Senator Cherry, as the superannuation spokesperson for the Australian Democrats, received a written commitment from the Prime Minister to remove the discrimination in respect of same-sex couples. A written communication was tabled here in the Senate chamber. It was on the superannuation choice legislation. I am sure Senator Murray would recall this.
        </p>
        <p>
         So we have a double moral failure. We had the Prime Minister of this country—typical tricky Mr Howard at his tricky best, or worst, frankly—some four years ago giving a written letter of commitment to the Senate chamber to remove the discrimination in respect to same-sex couples and superannuation. That was four years ago. And where are we today? It still has not happened. We have a very tricky Prime Minister—who is short-term and who wants a bit of legislation, in that case on superannuation choice, passed—and he gave a written commitment. I think we had Senator Coonan, who was the Assistant Treasurer at the time, brandishing this letter from the Prime Minister.

           She may support it, Senator Murray. However, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, in a serious moral failure, signs up in writing and then fails to deliver. There was an intriguing leak on a cabinet discussion in the
           <i>
            Financial Review
           </i>
           about three weeks ago. It was intriguing because rarely does a cabinet leak occur. It is a very unusual circumstance and it is very rare indeed for cabinet to leak and for a full-blown report on the issue to be given in the
           <i>
            Financial Review
           </i>
           . It was a report on the discussion that took place in cabinet about this issue. Apparently, cabinet was split down the middle. As reported in the
           <i>
            Financial Review
           </i>
           , there was a fierce discussion, they were unable to reach agreement and it was left to the Prime Minister to make the call. But the Prime Minister made the call on this issue four years ago.

           I will come back to that
           <i>

           report shortly. I noticed in some media shots the Prime Minister attending community meetings and addressing questions from the floor. When he was asked by someone in the audience whether he would remove the discrimination in respect of same-sex couples, he very bluntly said, ‘No.’

             So we had the Prime Minister giving a written commitment four years ago and recently—I do not know the precise date, but it was recent—saying that he would not remove it. It is duplicitous—that is right, Senator Carr. He gave a promise four years ago, a tricky promise to get a bit of legislation through. Senator Murray, I have to admonish you. I warned Senator Cherry at the time: it was a short-term tricky promise—

                   Senator Carr quite incorrectly interjects, but he quite rightly makes the point: has a police inquiry been called into this leak to the
                   <i>
                    Financial Review
                   </i>
                   of the cabinet discussion on the removal of discrimination as it applies to same-sex couples and superannuation? Parliamentary Secretary Colbeck, I would like to know whether in fact there has been a police inquiry—we can deal with this in the committee stage—initiated into that leak of a detailed cabinet discussion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But I will point the finger because we know who leaked it. Mr Turnbull leaked it. He is the one who leaked that cabinet discussion because he is under electoral pressure. I can see some smiles on the advisers’ faces—they know I am right. I hope this police investigation is being undertaken, because Mr Turnbull is playing both sides of the street. He has a part in collective cabinet responsibility and has to follow the lead of the Prime Minister, who will not deliver on the promise that he made four years ago. Mr Turnbull leaked that discussion to the
                   <i>
                    Financial Review
                   </i>
                   because he wants to ensure that his views in that cabinet discussion were communicated to the gay community in his own electorate. That is what it was all about. We would like to know what has happened with the police investigation into that cabinet discussion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Here we are, four years later, and the government still has not delivered on its promise, solemnly given in writing by the Prime Minister. How often are various people in the community going to be misled by this tricky manoeuvring of the Prime Minister? I just hope that the same-sex community in Australia really do understand at the next election just how tricky the Prime Minister has been on this issue. He has been very tricky indeed. I also hope they realise just how tricky Mr Turnbull was in leaking those cabinet discussions to the
                   <i>
                    Financial Review
                   </i>
                   . We know that he was the one responsible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Labor will be supporting the amendments moved by the Democrats. It is Labor policy to remove the discrimination in the area. Superannuation is a person’s own money. It is their savings. Why on earth the government continues to maintain discrimination in this area is just beyond me. It is a person’s own money—their own superannuation savings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I have two specific questions to the parliamentary secretary. Has a police investigation been called into that leak that was detailed in the

                    Financial Review

                   ? Where is the police investigation up to?

I think the last time I asked about this in estimates around 90 per cent were identified for the purposes of the penalty tax. What is the update on the approximate percentage identified? They are the two questions to which I would like a response from the parliamentary secretary.

                                         The government will not be supporting the amendments, although the government has publicly indicated that it is in favour of removing discrimination against people in interdependency relationships but is not limiting it to same-sex relationships. I think I have said before in the chamber that we do not confine it to same-sex relationships; we look at it in a broader sense in relation to interdependency relationships.

Turning to Senator Sherry’s questions, there are no officials here who can give us an update on the percentage of tax file numbers that are identifiable, so I will have to take that on notice. I am not sure that the other question warrants a response but, as far as I am aware, there are no investigations into the issue that he raised.

                                                 I am astounded because, as I said earlier, it is very rare for confidential discussions in cabinet to be leaked to the media. I cannot recall more than a handful of occasions in this government’s 11½ long years in office. I find it extraordinary that there was no police investigation into this matter. But we had a discussion earlier and we have a fair idea who the perpetrator was. On the amendments before us, it is more than disappointing that here we are four years on and the government still has not met the commitment it gave in writing four years ago.

                                                      Labor will be supporting the amendment to schedule 10. It allows animated programs of 15 minutes to be eligible for the producer rebate. Without this amendment an animated program would have to be at least 30 minutes in length to be eligible for the offset. So Labor supports the amendment. In concluding my remarks, I do note that we are to have yet another review. I started to count the number of reviews this government has had since the last election, and we are up into the hundreds.

                                                        . There have been hundreds of reviews and quangos set up by this government since the last election—hundreds of them. And they have the gall to have a shot at us for making a range of commitments in respect of reviews and investigations if there is a Labor government elected. I just make the point that, when it comes to having a track record on reviews, quangos and all these new investigations, this government leaves the Labor Party’s commitments for dead. We will support the amendment.

I do note that the departmental officials do not seem to be able to answer any of these questions. How much R&amp;D expenditure do these international companies currently account for? Can you tell me that?

You are asking me for a methodology of calculation. The Treasury obviously has a methodology of working it out but, as I have said to you previously, it has been a longstanding practice of government not to provide a breakdown of costings. I think that I have covered that matter previously.

They are not able to answer these rudimentary questions about a measure for which they have allocated $500 million on a flatline assumption of $50 million a year for 10 years—on the assumption that, for all the international firms in this country, every year for the next 10 years $222 million will be calculated as the basis of the claims against expenditure. What an extraordinary proposition to put to this parliament. That is what is being said here, and there can be no explanation given by the government for the basis on which those calculations have been made.
                                                                              </p>

These figures have been pulled out of the air and they have been calculated on a 10-year flatline assumption. The government have never been able to get these calculations right; yet they are only too happy to point the finger at others who seek to establish a policy parameter in this area. It is quite apparent that the government is not able to answer these fundamental questions.

I am not sure it is a case of whether or not I wish to answer; I think it is reasonable that I respond to Senator Carr. I am disappointed that I am not able to provide answers to the questions that he is asking. I think he is asking reasonable questions of the government and I am not happy that I am not able to give him that advice. I put that on the table as part of the debate. My action in taking the questions on notice is quite genuine. It is so that I can provide him with the information.

I think it would also be appropriate for him to point out that there are other more senior people in the government who should have made sure that officers were here to answer these basic questions. Given that, I ask him this: in the event that these appointments are made immediately, what will be the length of time for these appointments? Parliamentary Secretary, would you be prepared to take that question on notice in view of the circumstances?

Firstly, there are currently nine committees operating under the industry R&amp;D board act. Is it the government’s intention to immediately re-establish equivalent committees under the new act? Secondly, does the government intend to establish any additional committees relating to the venture capital responsibilities? Thirdly, what is the process for the establishment of new committees? Fourthly, what is the process for appointing members to those committees and what would be the length of those appointments?
