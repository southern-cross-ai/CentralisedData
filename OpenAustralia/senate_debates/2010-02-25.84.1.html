        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Is the government concerned that the established

        milestones for the national priorities of transport policy and road reform are not being met?

         Since December 2007, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments have been working together to reduce costs posed on business through unnecessary regulation. In November 2008,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         agreed on the national partnership agreement to deliver a seamless national economy. That agreement commits $550 million to tackling 27 deregulation priorities, eight competition reforms and other regulatory reform processes. It aims to remove the jurisdictional inconsistencies that create significant compliance and cost burdens for businesses operating across jurisdictions, freeing up resources to create a seamless national economy and improve productivity. Specific milestones to be achieved across the 36 reform streams between 2008-09 and 2012-13 are set out in the national partnership agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         The COAG Reform Council was asked by COAG to assess achievements against the milestones in the implementation plan for each financial year, as I am sure the senator is aware. On 23 February, the CRC released its assessment of reform progress. It indicates good progress in 2008-09 for 18 out of 27 deregulation priorities and four of the competition reforms, but it also identified some areas where more work is needed. The CRC report captures reform progress as at 30 September 2009, but I would make the point that since then significant further progress has been made on a number of reforms, such as food regulation, director liability and payroll tax, which were of concern in the CRC report. We are, importantly, on track to complete eight reforms by July 2010. By 1 July 2010 almost one-third of the reform agenda will be complete, including reforms to consumer credit legislation.

          milestone for transport policy and road reform was to develop future milestones and that has failed, how and when will the government address legitimate stakeholder concerns that they are dragging the chain on reform?

           I tried to assist the Senate by pointing out what was occurring and what the reform agenda was achieving. I acknowledged the report from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
            COAG
           </a>
           Reform Council which recognised the achievement of milestones but also made some criticisms of progress in certain areas. That is a public document, and I am sure the senator has had a look at it. In relation to competition reforms in the energy, transport and infrastructure sectors, progress is being made, but the government agrees with the CRC that COAG can lift its game in these areas and will seek COAG’s agreement to renewed impetus. There is a big agenda. Some of the agenda has been achieved at a good pace and some of it has not. On the areas identified, like energy, transport and infrastructure, we will need to revitalise the impetus.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. The government cannot meet a milestone to develop a milestone. Do you have any real plans to get the states and territories to engage in cooperative federalism to achieve results rather than just overloading the

             I think the senator is being a little ungenerous—and it is not like her. There have been milestones set in this process. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
              COAG
             </a>
             Reform Council report actually measures that performance—for the first time, as I understand it. What the report found is that many had been achieved but some had not. It is an honest, open report. We make the point that the measures were taken in September and more progress has been made since then. The report does indicate good or generally satisfactory progress in 2008-09 across 18 of the 27 deregulation priorities. So there is progress being made. Milestones are being achieved. But, as we have been open about it, there has been underperformance in some areas and we have made a commitment to work with state governments to lift the impetus in those areas of reform.
