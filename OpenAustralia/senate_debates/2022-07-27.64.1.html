         Thanks, Senator Sheldon, for the question. Today's ABS release of the consumer price index for the June quarter 2022 has shown that inflation has increased by 6.1 per cent over the past year and 1.8 per cent in the June quarter. It reinforces the difficult cost of living challenge for Australian households. Today's news will be very confronting to many, many households around the country who are already feeling the pinch of finding extra dollars for the increasing costs of living.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've been upfront with Australians since moving into government. We inherited a very challenging set of economic circumstances: rising inflation, rising interest rates, low wage growth and nine years of failed policy agenda, particularly in the area of energy. No doubt, through the course of question time, we will be able to list many more of those failures. But this is the major economic challenge facing the new government. It will be challenging for households in the months ahead, but we are determined, working hard every day, to look at ways to ease pressure on households and ensure that household incomes can keep up with some of those rising costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today's data shows that the most significant rises were in new dwelling purchases by owner-occupiers at 5.6 per cent; in fuel, at 4.2 per cent; and furniture at 7 per cent. Annual trimmed mean inflation increased to 4.9 per cent. Australians know that inflation is high and getting higher. They feel it every day and they don't need the ABS dataset to tell them that. They see it when they're in the supermarket, when they're filling up the car or when they're paying their bills. The difficult reality is inflation is predicted to get worse before it gets better.

            I thank Senator Sheldon for the supplementary. There are a number of factors contributing to higher prices and increasing inflation. Obviously, some of these are international, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine hitting grain and oil prices and China's COVID suppression strategy hitting supply chains. Any of us who have engaged with business or indeed tried to engage business in the last year understand the impacts that those supply chain issues are having.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are domestic pressures, though, as well—for example, natural disasters like floods and the new COVID waves here in Australia. All of this is having an impact. Those are really unavoidable to a certain degree, but there are other areas where nine years of policy failure from the previous government has left us exposed.

                I know you are all going to listen in absolute silence. Australians know that high and rising inflation has been made worse by the decade of wasted opportunity and bad government from those sitting over there. The Albanese government's economic plan is a direct response to the economic problems left to us—high and rising inflation, flatlining productivity and—

                   Thank you, President, for that protection. Our plan includes cost-of-living relief in the form of cheaper child care and cheaper medicines, and our plan for cleaner and cheaper energy to put downward pressure on power prices. I think the most symbolic policy failures of the previous government were the 22 failed energy policies—an energy crisis. The government was changed because of your failure, and households are paying for that failure with rising costs. We want to put downward pressure on all of those costs and be honest with households.

                       . The behaviour we've seen this afternoon in question time shows complete disrespect for the people of Australia. I have been told by both sides of parliament that it's about theatrics. We're here as representatives of the people, not as entertainers. Could you please clarify, Madam President, your expectations as President and your powers to do something about this, or do we simply rely on the senators' respect for the people?

                        Order! Senators gave Senator Roberts an opportunity to seek leave to ask for a clarification. Please listen for the answer. Many other Presidents before me have expressed the desire for senators to listen in an orderly fashion and to not be too rowdy in their responses. I will continue to do the same and I will do my utmost to keep the chamber fairly orderly during question time.
