        was supposed to have 12 new submarines by 2039. Now that the smoke has dissipated, now that the mirrors have been removed, it is clear that, under the new plan, in 2039 we will instead have only five ageing Collins class submarines. In October last year, the then

         I thank Senator Patrick for his question. In acknowledging the number of points that the senator made I would note, firstly, that the government has clearly stated that the fact is Australia's strategic environment has deteriorated in ways that weren't anticipated even five years ago. We know that the Indo-Pacific is now the global epicentre of strategic competition, and that is why the AUKUS agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States is so important and so necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of capability itself, we as a government are delivering on our commitment to deliver to our service women and men the equipment they need to keep us safe. I can confirm in that context that defence spending under this government will rise above two per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         in the coming financial year. There are a number of additional capabilities in which we are investing, along with those already planned, that will address the potential security challenges in coming decades. We are extending the life of all six of our Collins class submarines. All six submarines will undergo life-of-type extension within the budget of $4.3 billion to $6.4 billion, extending the life of each submarine by 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're also investing in advanced long-range strike capabilities including Tomahawk cruise missiles, long-range anti-ship missiles and joint air-to-surface standoff missiles. The Tomahawk cruise missiles that will be fielded on our Hobart class destroyers are going to enable our maritime assets to strike land targets at greater distance and with better precision. The long-range anti-ship missiles for our F/A-18 super hornets can strike land and maritime targets—the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASSM" rel="nofollow">
          JASSM

         s for our F/A-18F super hornets and in our future F35s as well. We're enhancing our capabilities in offensive cyber, in hypersonic systems, in autonomous systems, in space capabilities. We are confident, as I said at the beginning of your question, that these will address the potential security challenges in the coming decades as we move to the new submarine acquisitions.

           So, it's great attention, fewer submarines. Last week Vice-Admiral Noonan conceded that, by 2040, further extending the life of the Collins boats will leave them at 'far greater risk of detection'. Will the government purchase off-the-shelf submarines to be built in Adelaide to serve as the Navy's Super Hornet interim solution to the F-35?

            That's a fascinating metaphor: an underwater Super Hornet F-35. Thank you, Senator Patrick, for your question. I understand the point that you are raising, but, with your experience, I would have thought you would appreciate how inefficient it might be for the

            The Collins class submarine life-of-type extension remains an essential element of the government's plan to maintain a potent and agile submarine capability for Australia. It has a core work package that includes updates and upgrades to diesel engines, main motor and power conversion equipment. Both Defence and industry are continuing to progress Collins class submarine life-of-type extension work on schedule to support the first boat that will need an extension—that is

               I absolutely disagree with the proposition that Senator Patrick put in relation to that. We are absolutely committed to ensuring that critical skills are retained in the shipbuilding sector in Australia. In fact, our commitment to continuous naval shipbuilding will support at least 15,000 Australian jobs by the end of the decade, and over 5,000 of those will be in
