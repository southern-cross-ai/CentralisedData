        'Tasmania clearly has got a terrific boost from tourism. Anybody trying to book a hotel room in Hobart or elsewhere has seen that. That is terrific.' Those are the words of

       </p>
       <p>
        I could not agree with Mr Fraser more. My home state of Tasmania's tourism and hospitality industry is doing very well and he certainly was not exaggerating. Today's

        reported that the number of international tourists in 2015 was up a massive 20 per cent from 2014, and those tourists spent $351 million—a huge 34 per cent increase. When you compare Tasmania's figure of 20 per cent growth with the nationwide international tourism growth figure of eight per cent, it is outstanding just how well my state and of course the tourism minister, who is sitting right in front of me as I give this speech, are doing.

        The reason is obvious; Tasmania is one of the world's best kept secrets and it has been discovered. Whether you are down at the Salamanca Markets picking up some of the local artisan crafts, are a history buff, or want a unique cultural experience at MONA, Hobart has it all. It is no wonder that the CBD is hustling and bustling with brand new cafes, bars and restaurants popping up all the time. It is not just the capital city that is buzzing with tourists and fantastic activities. You could stop your car just about anywhere over Tasmania's breadth and width and find a bushwalk, the like of which people on the mainland would not find in a full day's drive, or even a few day's drive. It does not stop there. Whether it is catching the ferry over to

       </p>
       <p>
        In the north my home town of Launceston is also enjoying a cultural revolution of nationally renowned restaurants and tourism experiences. One of the latest is, of course, are the newly-built north-east bike trails, which the local or member for Bass,

        If you look slightly further north you will find the famed golf courses of Barnbougle and Lost Farm and to the north-west you will find the brand-new Cape Wickham course that has just been completed on

        magazine just a few weeks ago. Editor-in-Chief of the magazine, Brad Clifton, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Cape Wickham exceeded all expectations. It’s spectacular coastline for sure but the golf course is truly memorable and it’s only going to get better with its conditioning.
       </p>
       <p>
        So it is natural that we can also expect a steady increase of golf tourists to Tasmania in the coming months and years. Tasmania's natural landscape and climate makes it ideal for some of the best golf courses in the world, and we are certainly making the most of it with these amazing courses.
       </p>
       <p>
        If golf is not your thing and you prefer to hike or bushwalk, I recommend Tasmania's numerous world-class walking tracks through some of the most stunning scenery in the world. One of the best known is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overland_Track" rel="nofollow">
         Overland Track
        </a>
        from

         Lake St Clair
        </a>
        . Cradle Mountain has of course been on the must-see list for tourists for many years, but it is only one of the many iconic tracks in Tasmania. The newly opened Three Capes Tracks is similarly setting new records with the response it is getting. It has only been open for a few months, but the feedback Tasmania is getting from those who have completed that track is that it is stunning, world-class and is going to attract huge numbers of people to our state.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact is,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , as you well know, that no matter where you go in Tasmania there is something different to see and do. We have the facilities and people needed to give tourists an unforgettable experience. It is no wonder then that tourism is booming in Tasmania. Over the past year or so, more visitors have travelled to our state than ever before—1.3 million, which is well over twice Tasmania's population. Both international and domestic tourism has grown. We have had a huge increase in domestic tourism, and many of my friends from the mainland have told me how much they loved their visit to Tassie. They love the natural beauty of our countryside and they love our local produce. Internationally, Tasmania's reputation as a premier holiday destination is growing each year.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Planet" rel="nofollow">
         Lonely Planet
        </a>
        recently ranked us in the top four must-see destinations in the world and our tourism operators received unprecedented recognition at both the 2014 and the 2015 Qantas Australian Tourism Awards. They cleaned up, in fact!
       </p>
       <p>
        One important factor in bringing on the recent international tourism boom has been the increase in Chinese tourists since President Xi Jinping's visit in December 2014. In 2015, we saw a 14 per cent increase in Chinese tourism, and this is sure to keep increasing in 2016 as word spreads and programs and facilities become more established for this new market. I am particularly bullish about Chinese tourism because of the recent announcement of direct flights from Hobart to China, the possibility of which has been facilitated by the coalition government investment in extending the runway at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart_International_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Hobart International Airport
        </a>
        . The final planning is underway and construction will start soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        This influx of tourists is creating a whole new industry within itself. We have seen Tourism Industry Council Tasmania

        to develop and run workshops for local business operators who will be providing services to Chinese tourists. The workshops aim to increase knowledge of Chinese and other cultures and further potential communication with non-English speakers and are designed to give our local operators the tools they need to ensure a positive experience for all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chinese tourists, though, are not the only internationals taking a greater interest in Tasmania. In 2015 we saw the number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        tourists up 33 per cent and, likewise, visitors from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        have increased by 38 per cent. Indeed, of all overseas visitors to Tasmania, more come from America than anywhere else.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tourism boom has provided fantastic new opportunities for local businesses, and there have been a number of new start-ups and some great growth for established businesses. One of these is Pennicott tours. Owned and run by the world renowned adventurer Rob Pennicott, Pennicott tours has been taking visitors to the most challenging and awe-inspiring parts of Tasmania for well over 15 years. Whether it is the Bruny Island tour, the seafood seduction or one of the dolphin cruises, Rob Pennicott has found the best of Tasmania's natural attractions and activities and made them accessible and affordable to thousands of people. Thank you, Rob, for your commitment to our great state. I cannot wait to see what you think of next!
       </p>
       <p>
        Another promising development recently was the passing of the China free trade agreement in the November 2015 sitting weeks. This landmark agreement gives Tasmanian producers the chance to expand their business into a newly opened up market where high-quality, fresh produce is worth its weight in gold. I can see Chinese business men and women coming to the Apple Isle looking for our fresh salmon, cheese, wine, cider and beer. Indeed, they already are. I can also see huge opportunities for service providers to expand into a growing market that is hungry for expertise which we can provide. Once the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
         TPP
        </a>
        , has come into effect, the benefits will be even greater and we will have access to even more of the world's major markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am excited at the other prospects and opportunities which tourism operators and local businesses will see in the immediate future. We have seen our best ever winter for tourism and that comes off the back of fantastic events like Dark Mofo. But we cannot rest on our laurels; we need to be imaginative and strategic to continue to see our tourism industry grow. Government has some role to play in this by ensuring the regulatory environment allows our tourism and hospitality sector the freedom to operate and flourish. Tasmania has some of the brightest, most passionate and creative minds and I am sure that the future of our tourism and hospitality industry is in good hands.
