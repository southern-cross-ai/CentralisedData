        <p>
         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) As at 27 April 2011 the total number of staff currently employed by the department is 5329.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) As at 27 April the total number of staff who have identified as having a disability is 71.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) People with a disability are encouraged to apply for all positions. The online application process allows applicants to indicate whether or not they have a disability and if so asks them to advise of any assistance they may require. Contact information is provided should the applicant wish to discuss matters in relation to their disability and the assistance they require. The department collects data via the online recruitment system on the number of applicants who disclose a disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The department's Diversity Strategy 2010-11 and its associated employment plans aim to support the employment of people with a disability. The department has in place methods to ensure selection panels are aware of the diverse needs of applicants with a disability and to ensure that processes do not indirectly discriminate against people with a disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The department has in place a number of initiatives that support the retention of employees with disability. These include access to reasonable adjustment and assistive technology, access to flexible working arrangements, equality of access to training and career development opportunities and participation in the department's Disability Network. The department celebrates key events such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
          International Day
         </a>
         of People with a Disability and participates in activities such as conferences on matters relating to disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) All employees are provided with equal opportunity to access the department's suite of learning programs including leadership development programs. All employees participate in the department's performance management system which has a strong focus on the identification of learning needs in a career development context.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) The department does not have any specific targets. The department is awaiting the outcome of any whole of government decisions made in relation to targets.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) The department has the following policies, programs and services in place to support employees with a disability:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) The department intends to pilot a traineeship for people with Intellectual Disability to commence in 2011-2012. The trainees will be selected under the arrangements provided for in the Commissioner's Directions and will undertake
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_II" rel="nofollow">
          Certificate II
         </a>
         in Administration. The department will work in close partnership with disability service providers to ensure appropriate support is provided to the trainees. Supervisors of the trainees will undertake specific training in ways to support an employee with an intellectual disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The department will revise its diversity governance instruments with the view to refresh the Diversity Strategy 2010-2011. The new strategy will be developed in consultation with the People Management Committee and the six employee networks that operate within the department. An action based approach with clear performance indicators will be a key focus of the new strategy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The department will continue to participate in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">
          APS
         </a>
         Disability Network and will work closely with the
