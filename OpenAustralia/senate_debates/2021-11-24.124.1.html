         I thank Senator Bragg for his question. Businesses large and small are at their most productive and competitive when they spend less time on paperwork and more time focused on what they do best. That's why the Morrison government's Modernising Business Registers program will deliver a single entry point to streamline how businesses register, view and maintain information with the government. This new, fast and easy-to-use platform, announced as part of the Morrison government's Digital Business Plan, will bring together more than 30 ASIC registers and the Australian Business Register onto a new modern system at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
          ATO
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         A major component of this program is the establishment of director
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
          ID
         </a>
         s. As of 1 November this year, Australia's 2.7 million company directors can quickly and easily apply for their new director ID online using the Australian Business Registry Services website. This unique 15-digit identifier takes only minutes to apply for but it will stay with a director for life, even as they move between roles and businesses, and even different countries. In a world of increasing identity theft and cybersecurity threats, director IDs offer far greater identity security than is currently available. More importantly, director IDs will help to level the playing field for honest businesses. They will prevent the use of fictitious directors, help regulators chase directors' relationships with companies over time and better identify director involvement in unlawful activities such as illegal phoenix activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         To apply for a director ID, directors can very simply log on to the Australian Business Register Service online using the myGov ID app. It's free to apply and available to directors within Australia and overseas. Applications can be made by phone or by paper, for those who need it, but the online application form takes only minutes to complete and their director ID is issued instantly.

                  tor HUME (â€”) (): Since 1 November this year, in just the first two weeks of the rollout, we've seen more than 70,000 director

                  s issued, and 96 per cent of director ID applications have been digital. The Australian Business Registry Services website has had over 500,000 unique page views since the beginning of November alone. These are extraordinary figures, especially given the rollout is still in its public beta phase. They're a testament to industry and the community's support for this particularly important program. With 96 per cent of applications made digitally and online, it highlights business's support for this government's efforts to improve the efficiency of registry service transactions in online settings. Indeed, while the opposition will talk about illegal phoenix activity, only the coalition government will actually address it.

                     said that the consolidation of business registers will simplify businesses' interactions with government and reduce duplication. Businesses need only tell government once. Similarly, the

                     recognised the program's value as a flexible and technology-neutral modern business registry regime, and its potential to stop criminal behaviour and illegal phoenix activity. Director ID is just one of the many business focused solutions that the Morrison government is implementing to make doing business easier, fairer, faster and safer. It's part of Australia's commitment to being a leading digital economy and society by 2030.
