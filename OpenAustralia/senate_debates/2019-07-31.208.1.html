        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, Senator Reynolds. Can the minister update the Senate on how the government is demonstrating it is on the side of local communities with connectivity?

         I thank Senator Chandler for her question and also for her commitment to better communications for all of Tasmania. I can say to people in this chamber that I am absolutely privileged to be part of a government that is committed to delivering for Australia the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         . Unlike those who made a complete hash of it, we are actually delivering it. As we all know, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         is the largest—
        </p>
        <p>
         An opposition senator: You've got to be kidding me!
        </p>
        <p>
         Just wait and listen, because these are the facts here. You might not want to hear them, but these are the facts. The NBN is the largest infrastructure project ever undertaken in this country and remains on track to be completed by the mid-2020s. And our work rate just keeps on improving. The NBN is now available to more than 10 million Australian homes and businesses. This is an exciting and highly significant milestone in the rollout of NBN's fast and affordable internet for all Australians. It represents great news for all Australians who can now access this high-speed broadband and for those who will be next.
        </p>
        <p>
         Earlier this month, NBN Co connected more than 1,000 premises to the network every single hour. That's something that those opposite could not even have dreamed of delivering—1,000 premises per working hour. This rollout was so badly managed under Labor that contractors actually downed tools and stopped construction in four states. The NBN's outstanding current rate of connection builds on the timely and efficient rollout of the network in 2018 and 2019, during which the NBN connected just under three million premises in just 12 months. This government's investment in NBN has dramatically changed the communications landscape in Australia, with 5.6 million homes and businesses now connected.

            is now available to more than 10 million homes and businesses. It now has 5.6 million active connections. Our NBN is connecting more users every two weeks than Labor connected in six years. We are connecting more every fortnight than Labor did in six years. Over 60,000 premises per fortnight are being connected, compared to 51,000 under the entire six years of the Labor government—51,000 premises in six years, and 60,000 premises every two weeks under us. Soon all Australians will be able to connect. We are rolling out a multi-technology mix, just like the United States, the

                 by those opposite in this chamber. It was an approach that was a complete and abject failure. Under Labor, the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                  NBN
                 </a>
                 was a complete and unmitigated disaster. After six years of Labor—I'll say it again—51,000 users were connected to the NBN in six years. That amounts to two per cent of premises in six years. Labor's failed fibre-to-the-premises NBN policy would have cost $30 billion and taken six to eight years longer to deliver. This would have increased broadband bills by up to $43 a month, or $500 per year, per household. Labor paid $6 billion for the NBN to pass just three per cent of Australian houses. Now, under us, more than 10 million homes and businesses are available to be connected.
