           I thank Senator Bushby for his question. I am very pleased to report to the Senate that more Australians are now in work than ever before, over 1.1 million jobs having been created since the government came to office in 2013. What the latest jobs figures released today by the ABS underscore is the strength and resilience of the Australian labour market. Seasonally adjusted employment surged by 44,000 in August 2018, exceeding market expectations, to stand at a record high. Importantly, full-time employment also increased strongly, by 33,700, over the month to stand at a record high of more than 8.6 million and is now an impressive 202,100, or 2.4 per cent, higher than it was a year ago. Encouragingly, female full-time employment rose by 12,500 in August and has increased by 78,600, or 2½ per cent, over the last year. As the Minister for Jobs and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations" rel="nofollow">
            Industrial Relations
           </a>
           , Minister O'Dwyer, said earlier today, the government has put in place the right policy settings, which continue to pay dividends. We welcome these strong full-time jobs figures which reflect the fact that the government's strong economic policy stance is working. There is always more work to do, but, most importantly, the government is delivering for Australians, Australian business is delivering jobs for Australians and the government's economic direction is the right direction.

              The government knows that the less a business pays in tax the more it is able to hire new staff and expand its operations. We have cut taxes for 3.3 million businesses in Australia to the lowest level in 50 years—these are businesses which employ around 6.8 million Australians—and that rate will be reduced even further by 2026-27. Those opposite will increase taxes on around one million small businesses who, in turn, employ millions of Australians, damaging their ability to hire more staff, to pay more voyages, to invest and to grow. As I mentioned yesterday, the government has also delivered an extension to the $20,000 instant asset write off for a further 12 months. It is a very popular initiative. It's been a great success. It's extension is strongly welcomed by the more than three million small businesses eligible to access it. That is all part of the government's plan for a stronger economy.

                  I am actually aware of a risk; I can certainly hear it. It is those opposite, the Labor Party. The Labor Party would slug workers with higher taxes on their investments, higher taxes on their retirement savings and higher taxes on their houses. They would hike taxes on small business, medium business and family owned businesses. They are so blind to the needs of business. Why? It's because they are completely enthralled by the trade union movement, and by its most militant extremes at that. They refuse to see how those extremes cause untold damage to the Australian economy, to small business and to workers up and down the country, the sorts of workers who are in the jobs that have been announced today. They will put this country on a path to ruin. We have this country on a path to protecting workers, to protecting jobs and to protecting and growing the economy.
