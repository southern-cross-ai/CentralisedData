        by leave—I would like to make a statement relating to the awarding of the 100th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Cross
        </a>
        for Australia. Australia's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross for Australia, will be awarded posthumously to the late Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG" rel="nofollow">
         MG
        </a>
        . On 22 June 2013, Corporal Baird displayed conspicuous valour, leading to the ultimate sacrifice, in close combat with a determined enemy as a commando team leader in Uruzgan province, Afghanistan. He repeatedly drew enemy fire away from his team members and charged enemy positions under heavy fire. His actions enabled the enemy to be neutralised and his team to be kept safe. This award is in recognition of his most conspicuous acts of valour, extreme devotion to duty and ultimate self-sacrifice.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Victoria Cross is inscribed with the words 'For Valour'. Corporal Baird's actions were in keeping with the very finest traditions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>

          Leader of the Government in the Senate

         and also the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the other place. I also rise to pay tribute to an Australian hero, Corporal Cameron Baird of the 2nd
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Commando Regiment
         </a>
         . As Senator Abetz outlined, Corporal Baird has posthumously been awarded Australia's 100th
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Cross
         </a>
         , the highest Australian military honour. Corporal Baird made the ultimate sacrifice. He gave his life for his fellow soldiers. I particularly want to honour and pay tribute to Corporal Baird's family. This must be both an incredibly proud and an incredibly difficult day for them. Corporal Baird's sacrifice is also their sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Victoria Cross, as the leader of the government said, is inscribed with the words 'For Valour'. Corporal Baird on 22 June last year led a platoon that was attacked by the enemy in a village in Uruzgan province. Showing courage, showing bravery, showing valour, Corporal Baird drew fire away from his team members and charged enemy positions under heavy fire. His heroic actions and self-sacrifice helped neutralise the enemy and kept his team safe. Corporal Baird was 32 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
         I pay tribute to Corporal Baird and I pay tribute to all our service men and women. Afghanistan has been a long war. It has taken the lives of many of our soldiers, and many more have been badly wounded. When speaking earlier, Corporal Baird's family said that he would have accepted this award on behalf of his unit, his platoon and his fellow soldiers. This self-effacing, humble young man was indeed an Australian hero. May he rest in peace.

           Victoria Cross
          </a>
          —which, of course, came subsequent to his award for gallantry and other medals for service to our country. He was a hero. Interestingly, when his father was speaking about him, he said that the best tribute he could pay to his son was to say that he was always dedicated to the 'soldier's code'. He said that it was an honour to be a soldier in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Army
          </a>
          , to serve Australia and to bring credit to the Army, his unit and his fellow soldiers, and that that summed up his son. I think that is how we will remember his service. In doing so, we recognise that he was the 40th of our diggers to die in conflict. To remember Corporal Baird as he would have wanted and to pay respect to others in his unit and in the Army we must now look after those who have come home from Afghanistan in their post-service lives.
