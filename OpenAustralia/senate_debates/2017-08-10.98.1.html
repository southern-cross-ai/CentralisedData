        My question is to the minister representing the immigration minister, Senator Cash. Senator, I refer you to the humanitarian crises your government has created on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Manus Island
        </a>
        and Nauru. Do you agree that neither Manus Island nor Nauru are safe for the people Australia has imprisoned there, and that the United States deal, which has been trumpeted by your government, has been exposed by Prime Minister Turnbull in his conversation with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" rel="nofollow">
         Donald Trump
        </a>
        as a sham? Are you aware of Hamed Shamshiripour, who was found dead this week, after being held and tortured for years in Australia's prison on Manus Island? Why was he abandoned and left to suffer in Australia's prison on Manus Island? Why was he denied medical care by the Australian government? Why was he not brought to Australia? And are you happy with the outcome you have helped achieve there?

         I thank Senator McKim for his question. In relation to the first part of your question where you referred to crises, I absolutely dispute that. The only crisis, as you and I both know, was one created a number of years ago now, when you joined with the former Labor government to roll back the former Howard government's strong border protection policies which then resulted in the situation where we are today. In relation to that particular crisis, may I again remind you that, when we were elected to office in 2013, we had a job on our hands to clean up your mess: 50,000 people had arrived here by boat, and 1,200 people had died at sea.

           The point of order is relevance. I acknowledge that I asked a number of questions in my preliminary question, but I will make the point that none of those questions, in any way, went to the historically inaccurate information Senator Cash is currently putting before the Senate.

            There were seven elements to your question, Senator McKim, so it's quite lengthy. The minister has been on topic, but I will remind the minister of the seven elements of your question.

             As I was stating, 1,200 people died at sea and in excess of 8,000 children were put behind bars in detention and whom this government released. In relation to the allegations that you have made in terms of the incident on

               Minister, there's clear evidence that the chief medical officer, Dr Brayley, was personally told of Hamed Shamshiripour's deteriorating mental health condition over one year ago. Despite this, he was not brought to Australia for treatment. Will you at least say Hamed's name and will you apologise to his family for the treatment he suffered at Australia's hands?

                    Again, the answer to your question is clearly no. As Senator Brandis has once again articulated, Senator McKim, we are trying our very best to clean up the problem that you have made. When we left office in 2007, there was no-one in detention. When we came back to office in 2013, in excess of 50,000 people had arrived here illegally by boat and 1,200 people had died trying to make the passage to Australia. Despite all of your rhetoric, your false ignorance in relation to children and your confected outrage, in excess of 8,000 children were placed in detention behind bars because of decisions that you made.
