        Pursuant to standing order 74(5) I ask the minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister Conroy, for an explanation as to why answers have not yet been provided to question on notice 1282. It has been just over 30 days since I asked this question. I recognise that it is only a couple of days overdue, so I am not critical because I realise some of these things sometimes come in a few days late. I want to put very firmly on the record that this question pertains to matters that are urgently relevant and time sensitive and will not wait until 2012.

But what is of very grave concern to me and what is of grave concern to many people around the world is the potential that he will then be rendered from Sweden to the United States, where he has broken no law.

             I do not intend to speak at great length, because I recognise that other senators are waiting their turn. Mr Assange was recognised as a journalist by the High Court of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
              UK

              WikiLeaks
             </a>
             , as a publisher, he has broken no law, just as the people who put his material on the front page of the

             have broken no law. My question, to which the answer is now just slightly overdue, seeks to clarify what our government has done and what our government is prepared to do to ensure that he is not subject to rendition to the United States, where, as we know, his life is under threat. There has been speculation that Mr Assange would be extradited to the United States from Sweden, but extradition requests, as we know, come with safeguards. We are much more concerned that, under a bilateral agreement between Sweden and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
              US

               I am glad to raise that, Senator Brandis—Mr Rudd recognised the principle of 'innocent before proven guilty' when these matters arose. He stated quite clearly that he had a responsibility, as foreign minister, for Mr Assange's legal and consular rights. My questions have requested the foreign minister to make clear exactly what he has done, and I strongly believe it is in the interests of this parliament and the Australian people to know that our foreign minister is not only aware of the matter but taking direct action to prevent Mr Assange's rendition to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
                US

               .
              </p>
              <p>
               My final message is to Australian newspaper editors, television and radio directors and online media editors in the press gallery and around the country, if you are listening. I congratulate you on the open letter from the Walkley Foundation that many of you and your colleagues signed last December. Now we need your voices again. The
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
                UK
               </a>
               High Court has recognised Mr Assange is a journalist and Wikileaks is a publishing organisation. It is not, therefore, just the Wikileaks organisation that is under attack; it is all of us. At that time you said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               In essence, Wikileaks, an organisation that aims to expose official secrets, is doing what the media have always done: bringing to light material that governments would prefer to keep secret.
              </p>
              <p>
               You also said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               ... as editors and news directors of major media organisations, we believe the reaction of the US and Australian governments to date has been deeply troubling.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is with a sense of great urgency that I call on the foreign minister to make absolutely clear what he is doing to prevent the rendition of this Australian citizen to the United States. I thank the Senate for its time.
