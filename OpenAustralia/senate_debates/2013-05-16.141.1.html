        My question is about a catastrophic animal welfare issue and it is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I ask Senator Ludwig: as agriculture minister and as a Queenslander, what submissions did he make to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Burke
        </a>
        , for permission to allow grazing on national parks for the up to 300,000 head of cattle that are at risk of a horrible death from starvation as a result of the live cattle ban, bushfires and drought? Does the minister agree with the Queensland
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSPCA" rel="nofollow">
         RSPCA
        </a>
        , which said that the Queensland government's decision to allow access to national parks was 'a common-sense solution to a potentially catastrophic animal welfare event'?

         There have been, to put it in context, calls for national parks in Queensland to be used for grazing for drought affected cattle. An article to that effect, which seems to be where Senator Macdonald has got his information from, claims that the environment minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Burke
         </a>
         , has dealt with this.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian and Queensland national park estates were established for good reasons. This form of land tenure offers real protection to threatened ecosystems and species. But any decision to open them up for grazing, even where this was the former principal land use, needs to be carefully considered by all parties. While the management of national parks in Queensland lies within the responsibility of the state government, many parks have been established to protect matters of national environmental significance. Under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, actions that have actual environmental significanceâ€”

            It is very important to ensure that we get this right, because the tenor of the question is about grazing in national parks. Of course I have had discussions with Minister Burke about this issue. But, broadly, the issue involves matters under the

                       I reject the tenor of the question. If the Queensland government and Senator Macdonald cared about graziers in the Richmond area and those northern areas, they would have already signed up to Farm Finance, which we announced in the budget. I have asked them to, but I have not heard a peep out of Senator Macdonald on this issue. I have not heard a peep, not about providing assistance to graziers. All he wants to talk about are issues that do not actually concern the department. This is about the

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. I ask the minister why did he deliberately mislead the Senate in saying that no submission had been made by the Queensland government to the federal government, when I have a copy of the letter here that I can table? Secondly, Minister, what do you propose to do about the 300,000 head of cattle that are about to die a horrible death because of your live cattle ban and the natural events of bushfires and drought? What are you going to do about those cattle to give them feed?
