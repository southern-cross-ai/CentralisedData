            This is what is known as a 'capability gap'. As these ships age it is likely the amount of time they spend out of action will increase. These problems have been known about for years, but Labor did not even begin the necessary planning in government to replace them. Because of the need to replace them as soon as possible to avoid what would be a critical capability gap, in June 2014 the coalition government began a limited tender with two overseas shipbuilders to choose a proven design. Navantia has been selected as the preferred tenderer and negotiations have commenced with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike those opposite, the Turnbull government is committed to ensuring our Navy is not left with a critical capability gap. You get a critical capability gap if you do nothing, and that is what Labor delivered us.

                . Those claims are myths, they are irresponsible, they are scaremongering and they are inaccurate. Any assertion that the supply ships contract will result in 3,000 or even 2,000 jobs is incorrect and inaccurate. Defence estimates that the jobs will be less than a fifth of that amount. No Australian shipyards currently have the capacity to build the replacement supply vessels, which are almost three times as large as the air warfare destroyers—three times as large.
               </p>
               <p>
                Labor's own 2013 Future Submarine Industry Skills Plan states that Australian shipyards could not accommodate the build of the large supply vessels without significant infrastructure upgrades. Those upgrades actually had to have been completed by now to allow the replacement supply ships to be ready by 2021 and avoid a critical capability gap. Labor knew that. They said it in their 2013 white paper.

                 , I ask a further supplementary question. Given Labor's inaction, can the minister inform the Senate how the coalition will maximise Australian industry involvement in the supply vessel contract and future naval programs?

                  In relation to the supply ships we will, through negotiations with the preferred tenderer, secure in excess of over $100 million worth of Australian content. The government's

                  also includes a provision for other investment to bring these ships into service, like the infrastructure we require to port them and the training necessary for our Navy personnel to operate them. Each of these investments will offer Australian industry the opportunity to secure local defence contracts. Most of the sustainment work on the supply ships will also be done in Australia, providing millions of dollars in opportunities for local industry.

                  The Turnbull government has provided ongoing certainty for Australian industry, with our commitment to build the future frigates in Adelaide and to build the offshore patrol vessels in Australia. In fact, given that those opposite did absolutely nothing to place one single ship order with Australian shipbuilders in the entire tenure of their government, only this government can be trusted to deliver defence capability and to secure the naval shipbuilding industry.
