       <p>
        I rise today to speak on the passing of my good friend Senator Linda White. I note that the formal condolence motion will be dealt with tomorrow, but I will be unable to contribute to that debate, so I want to take this time to offer a very brief reflection on the life and work of an incredible woman—a member of the Senate who has departed far too soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do remember my first interactions with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_White" rel="nofollow">
         Senator White
        </a>
        at a Labor Party conference some 10 years ago when she and Terri Butler and I were engaged in negotiating the final wording of the affirmative action policy, which has so significantly ensured great participation by women in our party. She was a thought leader, and she was never afraid of the work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Linda and I worked most closely on the Senate Select Committee on Work and Care, and it was throughout the course of that inquiry that I first had the opportunity to truly bear witness to Linda's deep commitment to ensuring and furthering the rights of Australian workers. In her 10 years at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASU" rel="nofollow">
         ASU
        </a>
        , Linda was a formidable champion for the union movement. Beyond her obvious competency, I also came to know a woman of unmatched integrity, compassion and good humour. Many of the recommendations that Linda most strongly advocated for back in late 2022 when the select committee inquiry was undertaken—such as 26 weeks of paid parental leave and the right to disconnect—have since been legislated. It's a testament to Linda's forward-thinking nature and her status as a deeply respected parliamentarian in this place. I'm deeply honoured to be taking over Linda's role as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation and will endeavour to emulate the collaborative, careful work for which she was so well regarded in this committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        I close with words from Linda herself:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Getting justice for people has dominated my working life. How that happened and why it happened goes to a series of experiences, decisions and opportunities, some within my control and some not, which have determined the life I have led to date.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm glad the opportunities led her to this place and to our association.
