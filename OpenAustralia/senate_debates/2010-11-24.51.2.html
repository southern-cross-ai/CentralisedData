         by leave—I note that this is a very, very sensitive issue, and it is really disappointing that the Greens seek to misrepresent what has occurred in Tasmania through the wording of this motion. I know that it is something that the Greens tend to do on a regular basis. I just want to put on the record what has occurred in Tasmania. I will read from the document that Senator Brown refers to, which is headed ‘Tasmanian forests statement of principles to lead to an agreement’. While the Greens might like to portray what has occurred in Tasmania as an agreement, there is no agreement at this point in time. There have been some negotiations, and one thing that the parties to those negotiations have said is that they would like to keep politics out of the process.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition has respected the process. We have met with both sides of the discussion. We have met with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENGO" rel="nofollow">
          ENGO
         </a>
         s and have spoken to contractors and industry organisations who are party to the agreement, and we have continued to keep in touch. In fact, we cautiously welcomed the agreement when it came out, although we did point out some inconsistencies. There are a number of inconsistencies in the agreement. Sorry, I should not refer to it as an ‘agreement’; it is a ‘statement of principles to lead to an agreement’. We support that process. We have stayed alongside that process—as I said, we cautiously welcomed that process—but we do not seek to represent it for something that it isn’t. I think that is extremely important. There are a lot of sensitivities around the discussions. There are a lot of different interpretations of clauses within the document. It is not that the opposition do not support the process, but we will not be supporting Senator Brown’s motion.

          by leave—The motion talks to:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          ... the agreement reached by logging industry representatives and non government organisations on the future for Tasmania’s forests.
         </p>
         <p>
          That, of course, is an agreement on the principles. So it is exactly as Senator Colbeck stated. The motion is supporting that agreement that is signed off by the parties on both sides. I am surprised he is not going to support the motion. Having said that the parties would like to keep politics out of the process, the Liberals have cautiously welcomed the agreement. On the one hand they have welcomed the agreement and on the other hand, curiously, they are not going to support a very simple motion saying, ‘Well, let’s move that forward by getting support for it in the parliament.’ It needs that support. Senator Colbeck will be aware that there are attempts to undermine this historic agreement, which is going to be enormously—

              We need to be supporting it to move it forward. In the last week of parliament, with a summer break coming up, I think there is a lot of goodwill to have this agreement move forward. This motion is simply an effort to have that goodwill expressed by the parliament. It is very disappointing that, while it welcomes the agreement, the opposition is unable to bring itself to give support where it should be giving support.
