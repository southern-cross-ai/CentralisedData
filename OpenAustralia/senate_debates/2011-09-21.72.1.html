That is what you predicted, and that is what we prevented. We prevented a million unemployed, and we kept this economy sheltered and protected by our effective stimulus measures.

             We have an unemployment rate that is half that of other advanced economies. We have a significant pipeline of mining investment—some $430 billion—with a mining tax that the opposition have pledged not only to oppose but to reverse. They will reverse $11 billion in tax that the mining industry wants to pay.

               One of the great strengths of the Australian economy is our superannuation savings pool, which again, I would remind people here, the Liberal-National Party opposed. They opposed the creation of a $1.4 billion superannuation savings pool.

               is going to reverse the mining tax and, as a consequence, it will have to increase the contributions tax on superannuation and it will have to increase taxes on small business. We heard dire predictions. I recall the debate. We were going to have mass unemployment. The economy would be floored when compulsory superannuation was introduced. And what happened? It made the economy strong. And who opposed it? The Liberal Party.

                   has confessed. That is what they have to find. They have to find $70 billion. Fortunately, due to this Labor government and their effective economic management, we have—and the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   acknowledged this—one of the lowest levels of government debt amongst all advanced economies. But to add to the problems, to add to the risk to the Australian economy, the Liberal-National Party have pledged to reverse the carbon tax. But as a consequence they are going to have to reduce age pensions. They are going to have to increase income taxes. If they ever get the chance and they want to give that $11 million in mining tax back to the mining companies, which actually want to pay, they are going to have to increase the contributions tax on superannuation of $3½ million.
