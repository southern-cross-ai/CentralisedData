        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to the decision of the Assistant Treasurer to stand aside. What steps did the Prime Minister take to satisfy himself Senator Sinodinos was a fit and proper person to serve as a minister in his government before he appointed him?

         I would remind the

          Leader of the Opposition in the Senate

         that she was an official in the

          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         when their national president happened to be one

          Michael Williamson
         </a>
         , so let us not come in here with any pretence about this particular senator's background. But let us be very clear: I have no doubt—but I will take it on notice if need be—that the Prime Minister satisfied himself that Senator Sinodinos not only was but is a fit and proper person. Senator Sinodinos, as we were told by
         <i>

         </i>
         this morning, has had no allegation made against him in relation to corruption, unlawfulness or illegality. So let us be absolutely clear on this. The sort of person that Senator Arthur Sinodinos is, he will always put his country first, he will always put his government first, he will always put his party first, before himself. And that is why he very selflessly has decided to withdraw from the ministry until such time as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
          ICAC
         </a>
         matters are dealt with. I simply remind Senator Wong and all those opposite, and anybody listening, that Senator Sinodinos's involvement in ICAC is simply as a witness. I understand that Senator Doug Cameron has been there,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Combet" rel="nofollow">
          Greg Combet
         </a>
         has been there and many people have been there giving evidence in circumstances where they would have preferred not to have been called as witnesses. But just because they are called as a witness does not mean that you should attach a smear, as Senator Wong and the Labor Party have been doing for the last few weeks.

          , I ask a supplementary question. At the time Senator Sinodinos was appointed to the ministry, what knowledge did the Prime Minister have of Senator Sinodinos's dealings as director and chair of Australian Water Holdings?

           I do not know what knowledge the Prime Minister had in relation to Senator Sinodinos's dealings, and it would not be surprising if it was not any great degree of knowledge, given there would be no reason for him to inform himself about those matters. But, should the Prime Minister wish to provide any further information to this chamber, I will provide it.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. In light of Senator Sinodinos's dealings as director and chair of Australian Water Holdings, can the minister explain why the Prime Minister appointed Senator Sinodinos to administer the Treasury portfolio?

             I am sure the Prime Minister appointed Senator Sinodinos to the ministry because of his competence and personal integrity and the knowledge that he provides to the place. Let us be absolutely clear: the only person that actually called for Senator Sinodinos to step aside was the man that provided a personal character reference to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mokbel" rel="nofollow">
              Tony Mokbel

             , one

              Kelvin Thomson
             </a>
             . So let us just be clear here. Many other Labor members, such as
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Leigh" rel="nofollow">
              Andrew Leigh
             </a>
             and others, have been quite clear as to how this matter should be handled, but Senator Sinodinos, always the team player, always putting others and other interests first, has decided to step aside. We regret that decision but we also respect that decision.
