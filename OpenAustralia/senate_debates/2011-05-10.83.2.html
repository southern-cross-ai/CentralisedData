         I thank Senator McEwen for her question. As I announced on Sunday, the government is determined that no pensioners are left in the dark as a result of the switch to digital-only television. The government makes no apology what­soever for providing support to pensioners—who have worked hard all their lives and contributed to our society—to ensure that they are helped to convert to and get the full benefit of this new technology. The household assistance scheme has been a stunning success. We have converted over 38,000—

           We have converted over 38,000 pensioner homes for digital television across regional

           and Victoria in the 18 months since it commenced the Mildura-Sunraysia region. Under the scheme, a government contracted installer visits the household and installs and demonstrates a set-top box specifically chosen to meet the needs of the elderly or those with a disability. Installers also conduct any cabling and antenna work where necessary. Centrelink performs checks to ensure the installations are working properly.

           in 2009 to enable this scheme. In fact, Senator Minchin said at the time, ‘For eligible households, such as pensioners, this measure will provide some certainty about their capacity to access and utilise the equipment needed to deal with digital pictures’. In the other place, the member for Mayo—

             In the other place, the member for Mayo actually answered this question. He said that it is right that the government does help Australians, particularly those at the lower end of the income scale, to switch over to digital television. So there is the hypocrisy. Perhaps

              Mr Hockey
             </a>
             did not bother to phone Senator Minchin. Perhaps he did not bother to phone the member for Mayo, before he made his comments, because those opposite, including Mr Hockey, voted for this program.

             The scheme provides essential practical in-home assistance to some of the most vulnerable people in our society, those people who may have no other means of support, to adapt to what can be a confusing new technology for some. A household is eligible to receive assistance under the scheme where at least— (

               I am delighted to inform the Senate that the Gillard government's digital switchover program is making a real difference to the lives of people in regional Australia where we have commenced switching off analog
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
                TV
               </a>
               . One of the key features of the government's digital switchover program is that we have finally brought viewers in regional and remote Australia access to the same number of TV channels as are available in capital cities—something long thought impossible and certainly never attempted by those opposite. Last week we turned off the analog signals in regional Victoria. More than 455,000 households across the state have made the move to digital-only television. We have had less than 100 complaints in the five days since the switch.
