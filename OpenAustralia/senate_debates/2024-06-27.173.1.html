        I rise to express my sincere thanks to the Macclesfield

        . President Dennis Oldenhove invited me to have a discussion in regard to some of the government initiatives with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

        and its treatment of veterans and also the impending delivery of the royal commission report. I had a very meaningful discussion with Clyde, Robert and Peter in their beautiful rooms in this magnificent part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Hills" rel="nofollow">

        . I was struck by how each veteran has struggled with the system before being granted the necessary compensation. As a veteran myself, it is very troubling that my fellow veterans who have served this country in times of war and have received injuries, both mental and physical, cannot easily access the system of entitlements. Once in the system, they all admitted, they're getting very good care. I found it confronting. I thank them for their honesty. I will take on board their views in my own advocacy. I increasingly hold the view that our veterans' entitlement system needs a complete overhaul, and it needs to be far more integrated with current defence members who are serving. I'll work with other members of the chamber post the royal commission's report being delivered to deliver better outcomes.

        Whilst I was there, we also took the opportunity to have a look at the Macclesfield
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">

        Memorial Gardens, which this RSL looks after. It's a great community asset, but they do more than look after the gardens. They have signs there which have phone numbers for those that are feeling vulnerable and in trouble to phone. This has been a great success. They have expanded this to bollards throughout the community with those phone numbers, like for Lifeline, and they're being used. So I wish to thank them for their commitment to their community and thank them for their service to the nation. They are a group of men and women who I deeply respect, and I thank them for their time and their honesty with me as a senator.
