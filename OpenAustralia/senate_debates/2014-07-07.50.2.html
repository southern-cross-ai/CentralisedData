         I am aware of the Sydney university research. I am also very well aware that the previous Labor government left us a budget mess, which we are addressing. There have been a range of views expressed relating to the budget since that time. But what is very important for the Senate to note is the very fact that we are having to take tough decisions is because of the previous government's economic mismanagement and the budget mess that they left us. We had an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
          MBS
         </a>
         10 years ago that was costing this nation $8 billion. It is now costing around $19 billion and is projected to cost around $34 billion over the next decade. This government has had to make some tough decisions. There has been a range of commentary about that.

            I indicated that I am aware of the view. I am aware of a range of views when it comes to the budget measures that this government has put in place. For over 50 years, successive governments have recognised the need for a co-payment when it comes to the PBS. We have had something like an 80 per cent blow-out over the last decade in the PBS. The question relates the PBS. The reason we have madeâ€”

               As I was indicating to the chamber, over successive governments for nearly 50 years there has been an acknowledgement that there needed to be a co-payment when it comes to the PBS, to ensure that it is sustainable. This government will ensure that we have a sustainable health system into the future. The budget is going to relate to ensuring that happens.

                    I would say that, as with most studies relating to these things, this needs to be taken in context. This government has said that the requirement for a modest contribution when it comes to a co-pay is a necessity to ensure that we have a sustainable health system into the future. Unlike those opposite with a history of waste and mismanagement, which has led to the fact that we have a tough budget, weâ€”

                         Isn't it interesting that the shadow Assistant Treasurer actually supports a co-pay? Let me just share this with the chamber:
                        </p>
                        <p class="italic">
                         But there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all. As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc. And the idea is hardly radical.

                            The best way those opposite could assist the elderly and indeed all people across Australia is to support this government getting rid of the carbon tax, which is putting such a huge impost on people. Those opposite claim that they are worried about the cost to people. Get rid of the carbon tax. That will assist them all.

                              On 7 September last year, the Australian people elected the government with an unmistakably clear mandateâ€”a mandate to scrap the carbon and mining taxes, to stop the boats, to build the roads of the 21st century and to fix Labor's budget mess. Since coming to office, the government has committed itself to methodically and systematically delivering on those promises. Already we have introduced into the parliament legislation to repeal the carbon and mining taxes, to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and to strengthen protection for honest trade union membersâ€”all policies which carry the mandate of the Australian people.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              However, it is disappointing that over these last nine months, the Labor-Greens alliance has been hell-bent on obstructing the passage of the government's legislation. Indeed, so resentful is Labor of the decision of the Australian people that last week it even boycotted the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee, with the sole purpose of frustrating the passage of the carbon tax repeal legislation. The Labor-Greens alliance seems to be so desperate to keep the world's biggest carbon tax that they have tried to rort the proceedings of a Senate committee in order to prevent the new Senate from having its say on this important legislation. It now falls to this new Senate to deliver to the Australian people those policies for which the Australian people voted last September, some nine months ago. I therefore congratulate all new senators and also invite all new senators to reflect on the wishes of the people of Australia in electing them to this place and to respect the agenda on which the Australian people elected this government.

                                At the very heart of this government is a steadfast commitment to the forgotten families of Australia. That is why we are making a multibillion-dollar investment in our hospitals and schools. Australian families should be assured that the government has guaranteed total hospital funding to the states of almost $70,000 million over the coming four years. I am also pleased to inform Senator McKenzie, who I note has a particular interest in education, that the government is investing $64.5 billion in government and non-government schools across our nation. The government looks forward with the Senate in being able to deliver. Of course, need I remind the Senate that, but for the deficit and debt legacy, there would be an extra $1,000 million per month available for these issues if we did not have to pay the interest bill on the borrowings thus far.

                                  The most important thing that the Senate can do straightaway to improve living standards by reducing the cost of living and supporting Australian jobs is to repeal the world's biggest carbon tax. The world's biggest carbon tax was already high enough, but last week, because of the Labor-Greens majority that existed in this place, it got even higher. The former Senate refused to respect the outcome of the election last year. On the subject of election mandates, we must not forget that in 2010 the Labor Party went to the election promising there would be no carbon tax. In 2013 they went to the election pretending that '

                                  and Labor have removed the carbon tax,' yet now, just as in 2010, Labor comes into this parliament and seeks to repudiate its own election commitments.

                                     Those opposite might not like that answer, but it is indeed a fact and allows me to directly answer the question. It is a matter for the clinicians whether or not they choose to charge the co-payment. As somebody with a family history of breast cancer, I am the person most likely to be aware of these issues and to not trivialise it and to be well aware of what is necessary. So it is entirely a matter for the clinicians whether or not they charge the

                                       There have been a range of changes in the budget, as those opposite understand very well. They also are aware that it is a matter for the clinicians, as I have said and will continue to repeat, as to whether or not they charge the co-payment in those co-payment arrangements. This government has had to make some tough decisions to ensure that we have some sustainability for the health system into the futureâ€”something that the previous Labor government neglected to do.
