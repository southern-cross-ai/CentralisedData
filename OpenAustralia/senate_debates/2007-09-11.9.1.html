        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . Is the minister aware that the Intergovernmental Panel on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
         IPCC
        </a>
        , has made it clear that global emissions must peak by 2015 and thereafter fall quickly if we are to avoid a global temperature increase of more than two degrees and, further, has made it clear that greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation are the major driver of climate change? If so, will the minister ensure that, consistent with the findings of IPCC, any assessment of the Gunns pulp mill will include the emissions from native forest logging—given that it is projected that emissions from the logging and the pulp mill itself will be over 10 million tonnes of greenhouse gases every year? If not, why not?

         This is another example of the misinformation that the Greens deliberately seek to peddle in relation to the proposed pulp mill in the state of Tasmania. What has the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greenhouse_Office" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greenhouse Office
         </a>
         , the authoritative Australian Greenhouse Office, said about the forestry sector in Australia? They have said it is the only carbon-positive sector of our economy. As the trees are growing, they are cleaning up the atmosphere. That is the ‘inconvenient truth’ that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         refuse to listen to, refuse to accept and refuse to acknowledge because it undermines their misinformation campaign. The simple fact is that the pulp mill in Tasmania as currently proposed would in fact be largely using renewable energy sources. As we know, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
          IPCC
         </a>
         , quite rightly, has pointed to the evils of deforestation. What the Greens continually mischievously say to the people of Australia is that forest practices are equal to deforestation. The IPCC and others in the know on this draw a clear difference, a stark contrast, between wholesale deforestation and a responsible forest practice like we have in this country. As I have often said to the Australian Greens, I encourage Senator Milne, when she asks her supplementary question, to tell me one country where they do forestry better than we do in Australia. I will take myself over there to learn their practices and will seek to import them here. I have thrown down that challenge to the Australian Greens time and again, and they are unable to answer. Why? Because in their heart of hearts they know that the forest practices in this country are the best in the world. We must be on broadcast, because Senator

                 , I ask a supplementary question. Given that Minister Abetz has said that the Greenhouse Office assessed greenhouse gas emissions from the pulp mill, will he please make that assessment public. If he did not say that the Greenhouse Office assessed greenhouse gases from the pulp mill, will he now guarantee and ensure that greenhouse gases from logging and the pulp mill will be assessed, given that the prediction is that there will be 10 million tonnes of greenhouse gases every year—that is, two per cent of Australia’s emissions in full? Will it be assessed under the Commonwealth process?

                  I am glad that Senator Milne did correct herself. I said that the forest industry is carbon positive; I did not say that about the pulp mill. If Senator Milne is genuinely concerned about greenhouse gases, why would she suggest that 80 per cent of the product, which is going to be sourced from north-east Tasmania, be sent by diesel truck from the north-east to the north-west to be processed, which will put literally thousands of extra tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere? Why do you oppose a pulp mill, which will ensure that fossil fuels continue to be burnt by shipping the woodchips from Tasmania to Japan to be processed, only to be returned to Australia, through fossil fuels and the shipping industry, knowing full well that in Japan they will be processed in a dirtier mill than exists in Tasmania? It is so typical of the Greens’ ‘not in my backyard’ mentality.
