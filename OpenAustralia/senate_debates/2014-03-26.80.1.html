        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Attorney-General's decision to weaken the

         Racial Discrimination Act
        </a>
        . I also refer to the comments made by the executive director of the Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council, Dr Colin Rubenstein, that to pass the amendments as they stand would risk 'emboldening racists'. I ask the Attorney-General why he is emboldening racists?

        <p>
         Senator Peris, you are going to have to stop basing your questions on false premises, because we are not weakening the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Racial Discrimination Act
         </a>
         . We are strengthening the Racial Discrimination Act by focusing it on the central vice of racism—that is, racial vilification. Might I remind you, Senator Peris—I did tell you this yesterday, but you seem to have forgotten—that today there is no law of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth of Australia
         </a>
         that prohibits racial vilification. Not one. This is a tremendous gap at the heart of the Racial Discrimination Act. Rather, the Racial Discrimination Act uses the inappropriate mechanism of political censorship to stop people expressing opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do not think that is the way to deal with the problem of racism, Senator Peris. We think that the way to deal with the problem of racism is to identify the two great issues that characterise the worse form of racist conduct—that is, vilification, which is not currently dealt with; and intimidation, which is currently not adequately dealt with—and focus the operation of the act upon them.

             I was addressing the first part of Senator Peris's question. I had finished doing that. Now I am going on to address Dr Rubenstein, which was the second part of Senator Peris's question. Dr Rubenstein is a friend of mine, as he is a friend of many on this side of the chamber. Dr Rubenstein was one of the many Australians with whom I consulted during the course of developing these reforms to the

                   What we are concerned with is inserting into the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
                    Racial Discrimination Act
                   </a>
                   an explicit prohibition of hate speech by, for the first time, prohibiting racial vilification and defining racial vilification as 'conduct, including words, which incite hatred'. Senator Peris, unless words have lost their meaning, 'to prohibit conduct that incites racial hatred' is a prohibition on hate speech. But we choose to attack what you, Senator Peris, by your question, seem to acknowledge is at the heart of racism, rather than—as the previous Labor government's amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act did—try to close down community discussion and delegitimise those with different points of view.
