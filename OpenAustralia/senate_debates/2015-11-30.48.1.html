              , representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Our new Prime Minister has said that he wants to place science and innovation at the heart of his government. Given that the targets that this government is taking to Paris are totally inconsistent with the science and keep us firmly in place as the world's biggest per capita polluter up until 2030, will the Prime Minister now revise the targets he is taking to Paris so that they are indeed based on science and they do drive innovation, or is the Prime Minister just another politician who says one thing but does another?

               Senator Di Natale, you must not have been in the chamber when I answered Senator Reynolds's question about Australia's ambitious and effective climate change and emissions reduction policy and emissions reduction target. Might I remind you, Senator Di Natale, that Australia commits to a reduction from 2005 levels of between 26 and 28 per cent by 2030. That puts us in the median range in terms of percentage emissions reductions of comparable economies. But, more significantly, it means that we are one of the most ambitions nations in the world in per capita terms. By achieving emissions reductions of 26 to 28 per cent off 2005 levels by 2030, Australia will achieve a per capita reduction of 52 per cent, which is the second highest per capita reduction of emissions in the

               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, Senator Di Natale, you and I both know that Prime Minister Turnbull is a person who has been very, very close to this issue throughout his political career. You and I both know that there are few if any people on either side of politics in Australia today who have a deeper and more sophisticated understanding of these issues than

                Malcolm Turnbull
               </a>
               . We both know that. Mr Turnbull proudly takes to Paris on behalf of Australia the second most ambitious per capita reduction in emissions of the OECD, and that is something I think we should all be very proud of.

                , I ask a supplementary question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. We have just learnt today that Australia signed up with 18 other countries to the emission innovation project, which is a project that seeks to get all shoulders to the wheel in developing and deploying new clean technologies domestically. Does that mean that the government will now axe its plans to abolish the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, two agencies that power that investment?

                 Senator Di Natale, you should not conclude that we will do that, because that is not something that is in contemplation. What we are going to do is to adhere to the successful emissions reduction policies for which this government has been responsible. I said to you a moment ago that we will take to Paris the second most ambitious per capita reduction in the world. Let us compare our ambition with that of comparable economies.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the Prime Minister supposedly supports science, does he acknowledge the widely held view that Australia's domestic contribution will be dwarfed by the approval of the Adani coalmine, and will he join those nations around the world who in Paris will be calling for a moratorium on new coalmines?
