        ? Is it true that this process is being taken under contract with the New South Wales forestry department by a Tasmanian logging company, which was given an $825,000 payout under the minister's $17 million funding of Tasmanian contractors? Did the minister facilitate this contractor from Tasmania to outcompete other potential contractors in New South Wales against my advice to him before he issued or signed off on that contract last year?

         I thank Senator Bob Brown for his question. When we talk about the issue around Tasmania and the contractors' package, can I indicate at the outset that was an area where it was incredibly important to support the Tasmanian forest contractors in Tasmania for their outcomes in the reduced effort that was needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Gillard Labor government values and recognises Tasmania and the ecological, social and economic aspects of our native forest resources. We consider that it is important to get the balance right and a sustainable approach to how we manage our native forests. We also recognise the challenges, including capacity issues, that were facing the Tasmanian forestry industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the 2010 federal election campaign, as you correctly identified, the Gillard Labor government committed $20 million to help Tasmanian forest contractors and their employees. We did exceed that commitment on 23 November 2010 when we announced $22.4 million for the Australian government funding package.

         because this package was designed to deal with the oversupply of contractors in that sector while continuing to support viable ongoing businesses in Tasmania. The package was developed following discusÂ­sions with the Tasmanian government representatives from the Tasmanian forestry industry and the

         . The measures included both exit and financial support measures.

          The minister is aware that I did advise him that contractors getting these packages in Tasmania should not be allowed to come to the mainland to send other contractors on the mainland broke. I ask the minister: regarding the contractual arrangements with Tasmania, what is the $300,000 line item in last night's budget for processing the Tasmania forest agreement for? What further expenditure on that matter does the government have in mind?

           The object of the exit package was to help manage overcapacity in the forest-harvesting and haulage sector as the industry in Tasmania repositions itself. The guarantees were required to cease business operations in the Tasmanian sector for a minimum period of five years. Grantees were not excluded from being able to operate outside of Tasmania. I think that is an important point for the package and for the Tasmanian oversupply that was occurring.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are, as we know, ongoing negotiations and discussions around the Tasmanian forest statement of principles, the forest agreement line item that you are referring to, which was signed by the Tasmanian forestry industry bodies and conservation groups.

            I may give the time for the minister to inform the Senate, as he was about to, of the particular line item for $300,000. What is it to be expended on? Can the minister say when he will be announcing any further financial assistanceâ

                   I will not take technical advice from those who are not in charge. I can only go from those who have some command of the system; I do not. If there is something wrong with your microphone, Senator Bob Brown, we will have it checked out at the end.

                    In dealing with the last line item, it is not within the portfolio that I have nor the one I represent. Under the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities there is a line item, point 3, where the government will provide $0.3 million in 2011-12 to support signatories to the Tasmanian forest statement of principles leading to an agreement among other relevant organisations to better engage and consult with their membership in the negotiation process and assistance will be provided to industry, environmental organisations, unions and other groups. As I indicated, that is within the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, but I am happy to provide that information out of Budget Paper No. 2 as an explanation of what that is used for. In the broader issue that you mentioned, I will see what further information I can provide.
