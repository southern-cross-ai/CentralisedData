        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. At the last election the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        said in its policy platform: 'We want rural and regional Australians to receive a fair share of the prosperity they create. In return, they also deserve the same standard of education, health care and community services as their fellow Australians.' Minister, since Labor was elected you've put a handbrake on agricultural productivity, fumbled major trade treaties, introduced a new truckies tax and a new fresh food tax, and threatened the family farm with superannuation changes. Minister, is this what the Prime Minister meant when Labor promised to deliver regional Australians a fair share of the prosperity they create? And why are regional Australians less prosperous now than when you were elected?

         on getting a question—although I noticed that she hasn't asked a question of Senator Watt, and I have to say to her that she should have the courage to ask the senator a question about many of these issues. I'm very happy to answer.

             Senator Hume, resume your seat. I just reminded you, the last time you stood on a point of order, not to go into a statement, which is exactly what you did. I have said to all senators in this place that if you interject the minister is entitled to take the interjection. I would suggest, if everyone is serious about Senator

              on getting a question was hardly an unfair thing to say, but, if she wants me to withdraw it, she knows I'm always happy to withdraw. I make the point that this government has invested an additional $3 billion in the agriculture portfolio. There's $1 billion more for biosecurity.

                     Thank you. We have worked to remove the trade impediments with China. I have met with many in the agricultural industries, particularly our barley industry, and I tell you that they're pretty happy with the additional money they are getting from those exports.

                         There's $6 billion more in the Australian economy as a consequence of those trade impediments being lifted. Let's talk about health care and the work that this government is doing to increase bulk-billing and to increase support into the regions for regional doctors—something that you could never deliver. You trumpet your support for regional Australia, but Labor is the one delivering to regional communities.

                              There was so much of that question that was not correct. There was so much hyperbole from the party that posts on representing regional Australia while not delivering for regional Australia. You don't deliver for regional Australia. Did you support more bulk-billing in regional Australia? No, you didn't. Did you support more measures to get a medical workforce into regional Australia? No. You come in here, Senator

I can remember Mr Joyce, years ago, telling us how important biosecurity was. What he was engaged in was a lot of media stunts. It's a Labor minister who has delivered sustainable biosecurity funding. You didn't deliver it in nine years. And then, as I said: trade with China, additional support for regional communities when it comes to health care—
