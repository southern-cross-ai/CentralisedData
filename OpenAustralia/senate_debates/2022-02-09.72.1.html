        My question is to Senator Hume, representing the minister for communications. Two days ago, the government announced that it would increase funding to the ABC, restore indexation and continue funding the Enhanced Newsgathering program for an additional three years. That program, which sits outside of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
         ABC's
        </a>
        base funding, allows the ABC to employ journalists in regional Australia, particularly in areas which would otherwise go without local news. More than 70 people are currently employed by this program, and the continued funding shows that the government believes it provides value for money. Could the minister explain why the government decided to keep the Enhanced Newsgathering funding outside of ABC's base funding?

         I thank Senator Griff very much for his question and his enduring commitment to a strong and independent ABC—one that is shared by the government—that provides quality broadcast services free of bias or political alignment and is reflective of our population and the values and expectations that all Australians have, as they are the ones who fund the ABC.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government certainly recognises the importance of the ABC and understands that Australians also value the services provided by our ABC. We're committed to a strong and resilient ABC operating efficiently and delivering the best possible outcomes with the substantial funding that it receives. In fact, the ABC has more funding certainty than any other media organisation in Australia. At the moment, taxpayers fund the ABC with more than $1 billion every single year, and this is a substantial investment of public funds in our national broadcaster to enable it to provide television, radio and digital media services in line with its charter.
        </p>
        <p>
         The budget for the next three years of ABC funding, commencing on 1 July 2022, was announced, as Senator Griff said, on 7 February this year.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
          The ABC
         </a>
         will receive $3.3 billion over the next three years to 30 June 2025. As Senator Griff points out, this includes $45.8 million under the new Enhanced Newsgathering program to strengthen local public-interest journalism in regional communities. This represents an increase in funding compared to both the 2016-2019 triennium and the 2019-2022 triennium. The ABC will also receive indexation on that base operational funding, which does not include the $45.8 million under the Enhanced Newsgathering program. The ABC will also, however, receive funding to continue and expand audio description services to blind and vision-impaired—

           Minister, you didn't directly answer my question, which related to why enhanced news gathering is kept outside of the

            ABC's
           </a>
           core budget. Some have claimed the government keeps it outside as a way of keeping the broadcaster dependent and compliant. Could you rebut this by explaining, perhaps even on notice, the other components of the ABC's funding which sit outside the base funding, if there are any?

            Senator Griff, I doubt that anyone in this chamber would call the ABC compliant or dependent. In fact, the ABC were 'delighted with the Government's decision to commit $3.3 billion over the next three years to the ABC'. That's a direct quote from the chair of the ABC,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ita_Buttrose" rel="nofollow">
             Ita Buttrose
            </a>
            . In fact, she said that that funding agreement:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            … will allow the national broadcaster to continue doing what it does best—provide information and entertainment to Australians wherever they live.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
             David Anderson
            </a>
            , the managing director of the ABC, said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            I welcome the funding certainty this announcement brings to the national broadcaster for the next three years.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The triennial funding announcement is an important recognition that the ABC is needed now more than ever, and this funding is required so it can continue to fulfil its vital role in our democratic society.
           </p>
           <p>
            He even reached out and thanked Minister Fletcher and the government for recognising the enduring value of the ABC, particularly in this year, as they mark 90 years of serving all Australians.

              Minister, journalists employed under the enhanced news-gathering program cannot be offered contracts that run beyond the funding period. That is a fact. As their employment and financial circumstances are precarious, the ABC struggles to attract and retain quality journalists in regional areas. What would the minister say to these journalists to justify this policy of keeping it outside of the core budget?
