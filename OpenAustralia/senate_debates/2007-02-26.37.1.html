        My question is to the Minister for Human Services, Senator Ian Campbell. Will the minister inform the Senate how the government is consulting with the Australian people regarding the potential health applications for the smartcard? Are there any alternative approaches?

         Thank you, Senator Troeth, for what I regard as a very important question. This government is very keen to ensure that the people of Australia receive their health services and other benefits in an efficient and effective way—that those people who need help, for example from Medicare, get that help in an efficient way. Of course, Medicare e-claiming working together with the access card or the smartcard will ensure that families and people visiting their doctor will be able to see those transactions take place at the doctor’s surgery. We want to also ensure that those people who are ripping off the system—and Medicare and welfare fraud in Australia has been a substantial problem—are kicked out of the system. The people of Australia want to make sure that those people truly in need—whether it be because they need assistance with unemployment or assistance because they are veterans or assistance because they are taking their children to the doctor—get that assistance in a timely and effective manner but also that the fraudsters and the rorters that would rip off the taxpayers of Australia are kicked out of the system. That, indeed, is the core of Senator Troeth’s question about the smartcard and the access card. We want to roll out a modern, new, secure system to ensure that those people who deserve that support and deserve those services get them in a timely manner and the fraudsters do not get them.
        </p>
        <p>
         While we are bringing out this access card, which will replace at least three or four cards and up to 17 cards—a very convenient way for Australians to interact with their government—there is also space on the card for the people of Australia to voluntarily include information. Professor Fels, who is heading up a task force around the implementation of the access card, has released a discussion paper which will allow all Australians to provide feedback to the government on what goes into that space. I think that provides a very sensible step forward in the consultation process. We want Australians to have a sense of ownership about this card.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Troeth asked about alternative policies. We have seen the Labor Party mindlessly opposing this card. They seem to be on the side of the fraudsters, on the side of the rorters—they do not seem to mind that the existing system does create fraud. But worse—and I thought this senator would have been more sensible—Senator Stott Despoja came out last week and said that if you do not for example—

           You hear the fraudsters and the rorters making a lot of noise. It is very important that not only do we shut down the rorts and the fraud that Labor is supporting but we allow the Australian people to include emergency health information on this card so that if you are involved in a traffic accident or a medical emergency then information about allergies or about your health background or blood type or a range of other information can be quickly accessed by health professionals. Senator Stott Despoja last week had the audacity and the stupidity to come out and say that we would not provide people with health and emergency services if they did not put that information on the card.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">

           reassure the people of Australia that this is a positive that will benefit people. It will mean that they can have quick access to Medicare and other services but also in an emergency this will be a very successful way to ensure that people get the best medical treatment possible but entirely voluntarily. It is their choice; it is their card. If they choose to put the information there, it could help save a life; if they don’t, then it is their choice.
