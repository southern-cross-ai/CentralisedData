        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to a question without notice I asked today relating to COVID-19 vaccinations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take note of Senator Gallagher's answer to my question on the Queensland Supreme Court's decision. The court found measures relating to COVID were mandated on a number of Queensland workers without adequate consideration of their human rights as required under the Queensland Human Rights Act. Identical human rights provisions apply in Victoria and the

        </a>
        . So certainly there is the probability of the same or similar decisions being made in other jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd hoped the government would be fully aware of the implications of this decision. I was disappointed. The minister deflected and failed to address the substance of the question, so here are some more reasons the minister should get clarity on this issue. An employee who is fired as the outcome from a vaccine mandate can sue the employer, which may be the government, for wrongful dismissal. An employee who took a vaccine to keep their job as a result of a vaccine mandate, who is now vaccine injured, can sue for damages. Class-action lawsuits will result from this decision.

        will be as much in the firing line as Victoria and Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not just mandates. Evidence has been presented over the last few months that closing schools and denying children education has caused a permanent drop in children's educational potential and medical healthâ€”permanent harm. Last week, a landmark study of 99 million people including Australians found the injections caused an increase in blood clots, brain injuries and heart disease of up to 600 per cent. These injuries are legally actionable. Whether it's over mandates, vaccine injuries, education or business closures, victims will be joining class-action lawsuits sooner rather than later.
       </p>
       <p>
        All levels of government in Australia made terrible mistakes during COVID. Only a royal commission has the powers and the resources to decide what mistakes were made and how the victims of those mistakes can be fairly compensated. This will be expensive, yet failure to act through a royal commission will create a running sore on public administration for a generation. Only an objective royal commission will restore trust in governments and in the healthcare sector.
