        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Carr. Minister, have you been briefed on, and what can you tell the Senate about, the foreign affairs implications of the biggest operational addition to the Australia-

         The senator is correct. The initial rotation of up to 250
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

         in early April. Over a six-month period that initial rotation is expected to undertake bilateral training in Australia with the

         I have to say that the response from our neighbours has been muted or supportive.

          Indonesian President

         , who expressed sympathy with the proposal and even ventured the suggestion that the training exercises be expanded to include other nations in the region; I think he nominated China. You might recall that at the 2 + 2 meeting last week it was an Indonesian suggestion that the US presence and our own forces be used in disaster management exercises, again with a suggestion that other nations in the region—Indonesia, China—be involved in that. I remember the response to the announcement in November last year. I was not here then. I was not the minister then. I was, as the House might recall, an idle blogger, posting my comments—

            I was very attentive to the question of my colleague Senator Ludlam. I think my colleagues would confirm that. Again, regional responses to the announcement of the initiative have been measured. There has been interest in the scope of the initiatives, as one would expect. I was recalling, before the excitement emanated from the opposition benches—

             forces stationed in Australia is covered by an agreement with treaty status and Foreign Affairs has carriage of treaties, are there amendments foreshadowed or proposed for re-negotiation of the 1963 agreement concerning the status of US forces in Australia arising from this announcement?

              Not to my knowledge. Since Australia's Federation it has been a matter for the executive of the government of the day to make judgements about Australian national security and foreign policy interests. That has been the case for over a century and that is how it should continue. I would think the Australian people have been decidedly supportive, and why wouldn't they be? It has been an Australian concern for well over a century to see that our northern approaches and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Northern Australia

              are secured as best we can. We have a treaty relationship with the United States of America which is widely viewed as a cornerstone of our security. When you have a partner—a strategic partner, a treaty partner—you engage in military exercises with that partner. This government stands firmly supportive of this initiative—

                I am very happy to do that. I might say that the senator is closing in on a very narrow focus here. He is speculating about possible criminal behaviour, a breach of the law. I am happy to explore that, but I am highlighting that this is a major strategic initiative and, we think, an altogether happy one in fulfilment of a traditional Australian security concern. We are not apologetic about it. We expect this to be viewed by Australians, as it gathers force and the first rotating presence arrives next month, as very reassuring to the Australian people.
