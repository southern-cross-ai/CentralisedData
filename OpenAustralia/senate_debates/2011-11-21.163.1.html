        Climate change and the Australian agricultural sector
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 19 September 2007, the Senate referred the following matter to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport for inquiry and report by 30 June 2008:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) The scientific evidence available on the likely future climate of Australia's key agricultural production zones, and its implications for current farm enterprises and possible future industries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) The need for a national strategy to assist Australian agricultural industries to adapt to climate change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) The adequacy of existing drought assistance and exceptional circumstances programs to cope with long-term climatic changes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 14 February 2008, the Senate re-adopted the Inquiry with terms of reference unchanged and with a reporting date of 4 September 2008. On 4 September 2008, the committee tabled an interim report, and tabled a final report on 4 December 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate Committee report made three recommendations:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. The government should significantly increase the research effort in relation to the potential of soil carbon as a climate mitigation measure, as a means of reducing the capital input costs to agriculture [and] as a means of increasing resilience in agricultural systems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. The committee recommends that the government should provide for a full carbon accounting framework in relation to agricultural and forestry sectors in a domestic emissions trading scheme.

       <p class="italic">
        The government has considered the recommendations of the Senate Committee report. The government's response to the recommendations is as follows.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senate Committee report Recommendation 1
       </p>

         [and] as a means of increasing resilience in agricultural systems.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government agrees in principle with this recommendation and has significantly increased investment in research efforts into the potential of soil carbon since the Senate Committee tabled its final report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In July 2011 the government announced a new $201 million program, Filling the Research Gap, as part of the Carbon Farming Futures program of the Clean Energy Future plan. It will provide competitive grants funding to support research into emerging abatement technologies, strategies and innovative management practices that improve soil carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance sustainable agricultural practices. Novel approaches, including new crop and grazing species, biochar and biofuels will be targeted. Filling the Research Gap will build on the significant research into soil carbon that has occurred through the Soil Carbon Research Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Parliament passed legislation for the Carbon Farming Initiative (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFI" rel="nofollow">
         CFI
        </a>
        ) on 23 August 2011. The CFI will enable Australian farmers, forest growers and landholders to generate credits that can be sold in domestic and international carbon markets, allowing them to receive income for taking action to reduce Australia's carbon emissions, including through increasing soil carbon sequestration. The government will work to fast track methodologies for soil carbon under the CFI.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From 2009 to 2012, the government has invested $9.6 million in the Soil Carbon Research Program (SCRP), a component of the $46.2 million
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        Research Program under Australia's Farming Future. The SCRP is creating a nationally standardised methodology for sampling and analysing soil carbon. This research is identifying management practices with the potential to build soil carbon levels.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The SCRP consists of nine projects across Australia, focusing on:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        understanding the role Australian soils could play in carbon sequestration;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        improving the understanding of soil carbon stocks; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        understanding the impacts of management practices on soil carbon.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to providing, improved and consistent information about the potential of Australian soils to sequester carbon, the SCRP will help to inform the sector on the potential of soil carbon to reduce input costs by, for example, improving nutrient use efficiency and water holding capacity. Productivity gains such as these could be delivered through increasing soil carbon which would contribute to a more resilient agricultural sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government is also investing $1.4 million in a research project on biochar through the Climate Change Research Program. The project is targeting gaps in the understanding of this emerging technology and addresses uncertainties about its use. The government will be funding additional research and on-farm testing of biochar through the Carbon Farming Futures program. Biochar has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and benefit agriculture by storing carbon and enhancing soil productivity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Climate Change Research Program complements projects already being funded through the government's Caring for our Country initiative. Caring for our Country seeks to achieve an environment that is healthy, better protected, well managed, resilient, and provides essential ecosystem services in a changing climate. Caring for our Country will invest over $2 billion to 2013. Up to $171 million is available for investment under the 2010-11 Caring for our Country business plan and an additional $138 million is allocated each year as base-level funding to regional natural resource management organisations. Caring for our Country focuses on achieving strategic results across six national priority areas; including Sustainable Farm Practices. Recognising the benefits of soil carbon to soil health, the Sustainable Farm Practices priority includes assisting farmers to adopt improved management practices, such as cropping and grazing methods that increase soil carbon.

        Australia is working with other countries to develop new international rules that will enable a broader range of land sector abatement to be counted towards emissions reduction targets. As the negotiations are still ongoing, it is too early to ascertain whether agricultural soil carbon and other forms of abatement that are not currently counted towards Australia's Kyoto targets will be recognised under a future international climate change framework.

        Inquiry Report: Science underpinning the inability to eradicate the Asian honey bee

         Interim Report Recommendations
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Consultative Committee on Emergency Plant Pests reconsider the question of whether the Asian honey bee is eradicable from Australia; and, following that reconsideration, make a fresh recommendation to the National Management Group on the Asian honey bee incursion management response; the Consultative Committee should specifically consider this question in light of evidence relating to the potential for the insect's spread and resulting environmental, economic and social costs; the Consultative Committee should specifically apply the precautionary principle to areas of scientific uncertainty in its reconsideration of these issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that, on receipt of a fresh recommendation from the Consultative Committee on Emergency Plant Pests, the National Management Group reconsider the question of whether it is technically feasible to eradicate the Asian honey bee from Australia; the National Management Group should specifically apply the precautionary principle to areas of scientific uncertainty in its reconsideration of this issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that, in the event that the full Asian honey bee eradication program is reinstated, a scientific program of data collection concerning the detection, spread and eradicability of the Asian honey bee from Australia be initiated in order to properly inform future decision making regarding this emergency plant pest.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        accepts all recommendations and notes that the Consultative Committee on Emergency Plant Pests did reconvene but found that it again could not reach consensus about whether the Asian honey bee could be eradicated. The National Management Group reconvened on 12 May 2011 to consider the impact of the Consultative Committee deliberations on the original decision on eradicability. Although consensus was not reached, the Group determined that it is not technically feasible to achieve eradication.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, this does not mean that important control activities against the bee have ceased. The Government has provided a further $2 million to support a national pilot program to facilitate the transition of action from eradication to the ongoing management of Asian honey bees.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This program is being developed in consultation with Biosecurity Queensland and the honey bee industry and is close to being finalised.

       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (SEWPaC) and relevant scientific organisations, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation" rel="nofollow">

        ), be consulted as soon as an incursion is reported to provide advice on the biodiversity consequences of the establishment and spread of the pest.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee further recommends that a written response from SEWPaC and the relevant scientific organisations is made to the relevant agencies as soon as possible setting out the biodiversity consequences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Response:
        </i>
        The Government accepts the first part of this recommendation and notes that the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (SEWPaC) already participates in discussions of the National Management Group (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMG" rel="nofollow">
         NMG
        </a>
        )—the peak decision making body for national responses to pest and disease incursions. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, however, is the nominated Australian Government delegate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that as part of the decision making process, National Management Group members already consider biodiversity consequences of the establishment and spread of a pest or disease.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Relevant advice is sought from scientific experts when necessary including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), through the Consultative Committee on Emergency Plant Pests or the Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases or through Scientific Advisory Panels appointed by these committees. These committees are the key coordinating bodies which provide technical advice to the National Management Group.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not accept the second part of this recommendation. SEWPaC and relevant scientific agencies already have the ability to provide written advice either through the National Management Group or Consultative Committees. Futhermore, the National Management Group may need to take prompt action to deal with an incursion and waiting for written advice from SEWPaC and scientific agencies may hinder action being taken in a timely manner.

The Strategy outlines 12 initiatives to address four key areas: international student wellbeing; quality of international education; consumer protection; and the availability of better information for international students. Many of these initiatives address the Senate Committee's recommendations. These include:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        the establishment of an international student consultative committee and an annual International Student Roundtable to give international students a national forum to put forward their views in relation to their study and living experience in Australia
