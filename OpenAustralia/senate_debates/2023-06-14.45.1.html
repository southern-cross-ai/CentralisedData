       <p>
        Recently, I have been contacted by my constituents about concerns they hold for the people of Pakistan, and so I would like to take this opportunity to raise their concerns in this place. I've heard immense concerns about violations of human rights, arrests of citizens and political activists, violations of the constitution and the suspension of democratic process. People are concerned about the arrest of the former Prime Minister, Imran Khan, in May; the treatment of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTI" rel="nofollow">
         PTI
        </a>
        party members; and the harm caused to those protesting, with many injured and some tragically losing their lives. Restrictions on the people's movements and political expression are also concerning. Any suspension of human rights, including political freedom, that impacts democracy is deeply concerning to me and all those in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government is concerned about the reports of violence in Pakistan following the arrest of Mr Khan. Violence has no place in politics, and the right to protest is a fundamental part of democracy. The Australian government continues to call for all parties to uphold democracy, adhere to the rule of law and respect and promote human rights for all. The Australian government regularly engages with all sides of politics, including through our high commission in Pakistan. The high commissioner recently met senior members of the PTI party in March and with Mr Khan in May. We regularly raise human rights directly with government in Pakistan, including to underscore the importance of freedom of expression and of association, to foster tolerance and to strengthen civil society and its institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to those who have raised these issues with me. My thoughts are with those fighting to exercise their human and democratic rights wherever they are threatened around the world.
