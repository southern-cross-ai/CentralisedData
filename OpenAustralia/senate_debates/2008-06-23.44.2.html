         Dear Senator Wortley
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Thank you for your letter dated 13 March 2008 seeking advice on any consultation on the making of three instruments: the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Amendment Order 2007 (No. 1), the Listable Chemical Product (Home Swimming Pool and Spa Products) Standard 2007 and the Listable Chemical Product (Joint Health Products for Dogs and Horses) Standard 2007.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         These instruments were developed by the previous government. I am advised that the amendment instrument’s purpose was to avoid duplication and ambiguity created by the label requirements specified in the Order compared with the label requirements specified in the standard. The label requirements in the standard are intended to take precedence over those specified in the Order.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I understand that the purpose of the standards was to give effect to Part 2A and Part 2B of the
         <i>
          Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994
         </i>
         which contain provisions for the low- regulatory scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. These provisions were introduced in 2003 so that industry would benefit from a decreased regulatory burden when following the registration process for low-risk agricultural and veterinary chemical products. Under these arrangements, the listing of products, or classes of products, allows for them to be registered on application against established standards.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The decision as to which products, or classes of products, should be listed was made by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) in consultation with industry stakeholders and representatives of state government agricultural and primary industry departments commencing in 2005. This led to written statements on the consultations held, and advice given to the APVMA being provided to Senator the Hon.

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is aware that section 17 of the
         <i>
          Legislative Instruments Act 2003
         </i>
         , requires a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken where a legislative instrument is likely to have an effect on business. The department accepts that it should have included information on any consultation undertaken in the associated explanatory statement and will ensure that future explanatory statements provide information on consultation as required by the
         <i>
          Legislative Instruments Act 2003
         </i>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         While the code allowed the Parliamentary Secretary to direct the APVMA to conduct a round of formal public consultation, I am informed that at the time, he was satisfied that sufficient consultation had occurred with all stakeholders and, accordingly, decided not to require the APVMA to publish a notice in the Gazette seeking further comment.

         Dear Senator Wortley
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Thank you for your letter dated 13 March 2008 seeking advice on any consultation undertaken on the amendment instrument, Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Amendment Instrument No. 1 (Trial Protocols) 2008, made on 3 January 2008 by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Executive Officer
         </a>
         of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The instrument’s purpose was to amend the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Instrument No. 2 (Modular Assessment Fees) 2005 by providing a significantly reduced application fee for trial protocols requiring residues assessment. I am advised that this responded to concerns raised by the six companies affected by the fee when it was initially introduced. This fee was reduced from $2025 to $1070, and in view of the numbers involved, I understand that the APVMA regarded the change as being minor and wider consultation was not, therefore, considered appropriate.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The APVMA is aware of requirements of section 17 of the
         <i>
          Legislative Instruments Act 2003
         </i>
         , which require a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken where a legislative instrument is likely to have an effect on business. The APVMA accepts that it ought to have included information in the associated explanatory statement about the complaints it had received and that the amendment lessened the burden on applicants.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Relating to the footnote in the explanatory statement to the amendment, the APVMA accepts the Senate Standing Committee’s point that inclusion of the definition in the interpretation section of the Principal Instrument (section 4) would improve clarity and certainty.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The APVMA notes that the Principal Instrument should not have used the expression ‘application for chemical products’ but throughout should have referred to ‘application for registration of chemical products’ and also, where appropriate, ‘application for a permit in relation to chemical products’. I am informed that the error was noticed only after the amendment instrument had been prepared. The footnote was inserted simply to overcome the use of the shortened expression in the Principal Instrument. The shortened expression is in very common usage by applicant companies in the agvet chemicals industry and by the APVMA, and it is most unlikely that it would cause any confusion. Nonetheless, it is, strictly speaking inaccurate as it is not consistent with the language in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Regulations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         At the next opportunity, the APVMA intends to consolidate the three existing Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Legislate Instruments and will ensure the shortened expression is not used at all and that the full expressions ‘application for registration of chemical products’, ‘application for a permit in relation to chemical products’, and now ‘application for a trial protocol in relation to chemical products’ are used, as appropriate, throughout the new Principal Instrument. This will mean that neither the footnote nor a provision in the interpretation section of the Principal Instrument would be required.

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Sub-rule 7(6) states that ‘this section displaces section 142Y of the Act’. It is not clear what the authority for this ‘displacement’ is. Paragraph 142S(2)(c) of the Act provides that the Minister may issue a notice that provides for the method and timing of election of certain types of TSRA members. That appears to be the purpose of rule 7 in this Determination. However neither section 142S nor section 142Y of the Act makes specific reference to ‘displacing’ section 142Y. It is also not clear what the word ‘displaces’ means in this context. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking further advice on this matter.
