         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Environment, Communications and the Arts conducted an inquiry in early 2008 into the sexualisation of children in the contemporary media environment, including radio and television, children’s magazines, other print and advertising material and the Internet.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate referred the matter of the sexualisation of children in the contemporary media environment to the Senate Committee on the 12 March 2008. The terms of reference for the inquiry covered:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the sources and beneficiaries of premature sexualisation of children in the media;
        </li>
        <li>
         the evidence on the short- and long-term effects of viewing or buying sexualising and objectifying images and products and their influence on cognitive functioning, physical and mental health, sexuality, attitudes and beliefs; and
        </li>
        <li>
         strategies to prevent and/or reduce the sexualisation of children in the media and the effectiveness of different approaches in ameliorating its effects, including the role of school-based sexuality and reproductive health education and change in media and advertising regulation such as the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice and the Commercial Radio Codes of Practice.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        received over 160 submissions from a wide range of interested individuals and organisations. On 26 June 2008 the Committee tabled its report to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Senate
        </a>
        . The report makes 13 recommendations, including that the Senate review the issue again in 18 months time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report calls on broadcasters and publishers to review their own content that is of concern (music videos that show sexualising imagery), and for publishers to consider providing reader advice on the cover of magazines indicating the presence of material that may be inappropriate for children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In regard to children’s television, the report recommends that the

        , the report makes a number of recommendations in relation to classification of billboards and outdoor advertising, advertising to children, pre- vetting advertisements which are likely to cause offence, and the development of processes for community consultation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report also recommends that state and territory governments consider the introduction of comprehensive sexual health and relationships education programs into all Australian schools.

         Regulation of broadcasting and images of children
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commercial television and radio services are currently provided under a co-regulatory framework that recognises the importance of ensuring that programs reflect community standards and provides a means by which the community can formally express its views to commercial broadcasters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires sections of the commercial broadcasting industry to develop self-regulatory codes of practice to deal with the content of television and radio programs and methods for handling complaints. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is responsible for overseeing the development of these codes, which include rules for prohibited content and classification guidelines for content that may be considered offensive, such as sexualised images of children.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice includes classification guidelines for the broadcast of programs and advertising within particular time periods. The guidelines relate to a range of matters including adult themes, offensive language, violence, sex and nudity and are intended to be in accordance with prevailing community attitudes.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Subscription Broadcast Television Codes of Practice also includes guidelines for the classification of programs.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Commercial Radio Codes of Practice requires radio content to meet contemporary standards of decency having regard to the likely characteristics of the audience.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The ACMA Children’s Television Standards (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTS" rel="nofollow">
         CTS
        </a>
        ) also sets out rules for the quantity, classification and scheduling of children’s programming on commercial free-to-air television, including restrictions on advertising directed to children, to ensure that children have access to programming that is suited to their needs while also ensuring that children are protected from television content that is unsuitable for them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The national broadcasters’ codes of practice reflect their legislative Charters. The ABC Code of Practice comprises a range of general program codes covering ABC policy on the portrayal of violence, language, sex and sexuality, discrimination and privacy, as well as specific codes covering children’s programs, religious and indigenous programs, the portrayal of women and the avoidance of stereotypes.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code" rel="nofollow">
         The Code
        </a>
        also covers mandatory program content warnings and program classifications, and complaints handling.

        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        Code of Practice details SBS’s obligations concerning program classification, consumer advice and complaints handling, advertising and sponsorship. Program policies cover levels of violence, sex and nudity and the use of language, as well as particular reference to issues of prejudice, racism and discrimination.

        <b>
         Complaint handling
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ACMA handles certain complaints about television and radio content. In the first instance, complaints about content should be submitted in writing to the relevant broadcaster within 30 days of the broadcast at issue. However, under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, if a complaint is not answered within 60 working days of being received or satisfactorily dealt with, then the matter may be referred to the ACMA. Subscription television broadcasters have 60 days to respond. Complaints about issues covered by the Australian Content Standard and the CTS can be made in writing directly to ACMA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A number of other issues relating to broadcasting content are not handled by ACMA. Other relevant agencies that have complaint procedures for handling broadcasting content issues include:
       </p>

        Since April 2008, decisions made by the Advertising Standards Bureau’s Advertising Standards Board in relation to complaints about advertisements may be reviewed by an Independent Reviewer.

       <p class="italic">
        Under the television codes, television commercials must comply with the self- regulatory Advertiser Code of Ethics and the Code for Advertising and Marketing Communications to Children developed by the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA). These codes deal with the decency and social responsibility of advertisements, particularly in relation to children.

        2008, the AANA released a revised Code for Advertising and Marketing Communications to Children after extensive public consultation which now specifically prohibits the use of sexual imagery of children in advertising or marketing, whether in print, on television or online.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The inquiry’s report does not address the sexualisation of children in art photography. However, the Government recognises there must be a sensible approach to the allocation of public funds for arts projects which takes into account community standards.

        , the Government’s principal arts funding body, has developed protocols in consultation with the community regarding the depiction of children in artworks, exhibitions and publications that receive Australian government funding. Adherence to these protocols will be a condition of funding for projects supported by the Australia Council and other government arts agencies. These protocols took effect from 1 January 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With respect to material on the internet, at their meeting on 6 November 2008 Censorship Ministers requested the Secretary of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (Censorship) convey to relevant peak bodies the Ministers’ view that organisations which use images of children in advertising for commercial gain should consider developing protocols regarding the content and format of such advertisements online.

         National framework for protecting Australia’s children

       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is pursuing a broad children’s policy agenda, including the development and implementation of a National Child Protection Framework. The Government allocated $2.6 million in the 2008-09 Budget to developing the Framework, recognising that the safety and wellbeing of Australia’s children is critical. Action will focus on preventing abuse through early intervention and better integration of family services, and will drive best practice across jurisdictions and government and non-government sectors through clearer national reporting and accountability mechanisms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is leading a consultation process towards a practical, action-focused framework that makes a difference in the lives of children. Consultation is occurring with appropriate stakeholders including state and territory governments, peak organisations and non-government organisations working with children, families, out-of-home care systems and foster carers.

         Recommendations and Australian Government Response

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Recommendation 1
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee considers that the inappropriate sexualisation of children in Australia is of increasing concern. While noting the complexity of defining clear boundaries around this issue, the Committee believes that preventing the premature sexualisation of children is a significant cultural challenge. This is a community responsibility which demands action by society. In particular, the onus is on broadcasters, publishers, advertisers, retailers and manufacturers to take account of these community concerns.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noting this heightened concern, the Committee believes that this issue should be followed up and therefore recommends that the steps taken to address it by industry bodies and others should be further considered by the Senate in 18 months time.

         Recommendation 3
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that, as part of its review of the Children’s Television Standards (CTS), the Australian Communications and Media Authority consider revising the requirement that CTS content be broadcast for at least half an hour per day to enable broadcasters to schedule it in extended blocks at times which are more likely to attract children to watch it.

        <b>
         Australian Government Response
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ACMA’s draft Children Television Standards 2008 (CTS) were released on 27 August 2008 for public comment. The draft CTS provide licensees with an
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        additional flexible scheduling option for the broadcast of children’s (C) programs. While the mandatory annual quota of 260 hours per year has not changed, licensees can choose to broadcast C programs in blocks of a minimum of one hour duration and on a minimum of two days per week.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ACMA considers that giving licensees the alternative option of broadcasting C programs in minimum 60 minute blocks and on a minimum of two days per week has the potential to benefit the child audience by providing increased flexibility for broadcasters to determine how better placement of C programs could occur.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ACMA proposes to review this change after 12 months to ensure that it is not having adverse effects on the scheduling of C programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consultation on the draft CTS closed on 17 October 2008 and ACMA anticipates that the CTS will be finalised in the second half 2009.

        The Government believes that the classification system is intended to reflect community standards. At present, complaints statistics indicate a low level of community concern about music videos. Statistics provided to the Government by Free TV Australia show that, of all complaints received by broadcasters over the past 5 years, only 0.8% have been about a music video program. Free TV Australia has also advised that there was no level of concern raised in the 1300 submissions to the last Code review.

        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 20 March 2008, the Senate referred the matter of the effectiveness of broadcasting codes of practice to the Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts, for inquiry and report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The terms of reference for the inquiry covered the frequency and use of coarse and foul language (swearing) in programs; the effectiveness of the current classification standards as an accurate reflection of the content contained in the program; and the operation and effectiveness of the complaints process currently available to members of the public.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee received over 80 submissions including from representatives of the television and radio industries, as well as from family and community groups and the public. On 19 June 2008 the Committee tabled its report to the President of the Senate. The report makes 20 recommendations. The recommendations cover issues relating to the: complaints process; regulatory environment; compliance process; and enforcement process.

       <p class="italic">
        Co-regulation of television and radio broadcasting services
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commercial television and radio services are provided under a co-regulatory legal framework that recognises the importance of ensuring that content reflects community standards and provides a means by which the community can formally express its views to commercial broadcasters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires sections of the commercial broadcasting industry to develop self-regulatory codes of practice to deal with the content of television and radio programs and methods for handling complaints. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is responsible for registering these codes.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice includes classification guidelines for the broadcast of programs and advertising within particular time periods. The guidelines relate to a range of matters including adult themes, offensive language, violence, sex and nudity and are intended to be in accordance with prevailing community attitudes.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Subscription Broadcast Television Codes of Practice also includes guidelines for the classification of programs.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Commercial Radio Codes of Practice requires radio content to meet contemporary standards of decency having regard to the likely characteristics of the audience.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Additionally the Australian Content Standard requires minimum levels of Australian programming to be shown on commercial free-to-air television to ensure that commercial television services develop and reflect a sense of Australian identity, character and culture.
       </p>

         The Children

        ’s Television Standards (CTS) also sets out rules for the quantity, classification and scheduling of children’s programming on commercial free-to-air television, including restrictions on advertising directed to children, to ensure that children have access to programming that is suited to their needs while also ensuring that children are protected from television content that is unsuitable for them.

         Complaint handling
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ACMA handles certain complaints about television and radio content. In the first instance, complaints about content should be submitted in writing to the relevant broadcaster within 30 days of the broadcast at issue. However, under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, if a complaint is not answered within 60 working days of being received or satisfactorily dealt with, then the matter may be referred to the ACMA. Subscription television broadcasters have 60 days to respond. Complaints about issues covered by the Australian Content Standard and the CTS can be made in writing directly to ACMA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A number of other issues related to broadcasting content are not handled by ACMA. Some other relevant agencies include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Australian Competition and Consumer Commission - for complaints about false, misleading and deceptive conduct in advertising;
        </li>
        <li>
         Advertising Standards Bureau - for complaints about the decency of advertisements, whether on television, radio, Internet, print or elsewhere; and
        </li>
        <li>
         Australian Press Council – for complaints about the print media, including articles in newspapers and magazines.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An effective complaints process is a central requirement for an effective co-regulatory environment and the ANAO audit found that the majority of broadcasting complaints have been actioned. However, both the ANAO audit report and the Senate Committee’s report highlight areas where improvements can be made.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The two reports recommend that current complaints processes should improve tracking of complaints and accept complaints via a wider range of media, including email. The timeliness of complaint resolutions was also identified as a common issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ACMA are currently implementing ANAO recommendations and in 2008-09 their activities included:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         identification of ACMA ‘best practice’ investigations processes;
        </li>
        <li>
         production of an investigations manual that documents best practice processes, ensuring greater consistency across the breadth and diversity of ACMA’s investigations; and

        <li>
         creation of an ACMA forum to promote more efficient use of resources through information-sharing across teams.

       <p class="italic">
        The use of datacasting to provide additional information on television programs is a matter for broadcasters to consider.
