        COAL MINING INDUSTRY (LONG SERVICE LEAVE FUNDING) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill amends the coal mining industry long service leave funding scheme to embody the current award-based long service leave entitlement into Commonwealth legislation, with amendments to the qualification period from 'continuous service' to 'aggregate service'. The bill will also facilitate changes to employer reimbursement arrangements and the basis on which the levy is imposed. In addition, compliance arrangements for the scheme will be improved and changes will be made to the structure of the representation on the Board including establishing an independent Chair.

         The Government

        has given a commitment to black coal mining industry stakeholders that it would use best endeavours to ensure that the amendments to the scheme could commence on 1 January 2012. The Coal Mining Industry (

        ) Corporation has commissioned systems changes to take effect from this date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments benefit both employers and employees in the black coal mining industry. Employers will benefit from a closer alignment between the amount of levy payable by employers and the amount to which employers are entitled to be reimbursed under the scheme. Employees will have the certainty and benefit of a legislated long service leave entitlement with improved compliance arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments also seek to remedy an unintentional effect of the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Amendment Act 2009 (the Amendment Act) which allows employees included into the scheme by Schedule 2 of the Amendment Act to be reimbursed for service in the black coal mining industry dating back indefinitely.

        on 3 April 2010 highlighted the inadequacy of existing provisions to act as an effective deterrent to shipping companies and their crew operating vessels in a way that damages, or is likely to damage, marine ecosystems critical to Australia, such as the Great Barrier Reef. Current Commonwealth provisions fall significantly short of penalties operating in State waters and have dissuaded prosecution for offences because the penalties are inconsequential. The bill will strengthen the Commonwealth's capacity to protect environmentally sensitive marine ecosystems and will give effect to action announced on 18 April 2010.

        The bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to enable the Repatriation Commission to determine, by legislative instrument, additional eligibility criteria relating to British nuclear test defence service. The bill also amends the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006 to enable the Repatriation Commission to determine, by legislative instrument, additional eligibility criteria relating to nuclear test participants.
