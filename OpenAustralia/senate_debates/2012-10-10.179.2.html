         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The seasonal outlooks published by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
          Bureau of Meteorology
         </a>
         provide what are known as a "probablilistic" forecasts. They do not forecast a definite outcome, but rather the chances or odds that a given area will be hotter or cooler, or wetter or drier, than the median value. They also do not predict how much above or below median.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Various measures of skill or accuracy can be used to assess a probabilistic forecast. In general, these measures compare the most likely (ie probabilistic) outcome to the subsequently observed outcome, and in turn how this would compare to a simple forecast scheme such as using climatology.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Seasonal forecast models are best evaluated over a large number of forecasts rather than using single events. They have proven to be valuable for decision-making when used with other relevant information as part of an assessment of risks.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Outlooks have demonstrated historical skill, with seasonal outlooks for temperature particularly accurate â€“ for example in the last 12 months these show positive skill in all but 1 month across Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The following responses are provided with reference to the seasonal outlooks issued in December 2011 for the first three months of 2012. The outlooks were for a:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) 50 to 80 per cent chance of exceeding the median maximum temperature over eastern Australia (or a 20 to 50 per cent chance of being below median);
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) 50 to 75 per cent chance of being below the median maximum temperature for the western two-thirds of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         ;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) 60 to 85 per cent chance of above median minimum temperatures over northern Australia and Western Australia;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) 50 to 70 per cent chance of rainfall below the median across
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , the western half of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , and Queensland with the exception of the southeast quarter of the state; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) 50 to 70 per cent chance of above median rainfall totals across Western Australia, southeast Queensland and the majority of eastern New South Wales.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) For each of the above paragraphs, from (a) to (e), the recorded seasonal conditions were:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) most of the country, including the east, recorded below-median maximum temperatures for this period;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) aside from the far west and a patch in the south, below median maximum temperatures were observed;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) seasonal minimum temperatures were mainly below the median except for patches of the north and the far west of Western Australia;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) above median rainfall was generally observed; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) rainfall was above the median across most of Western Australia with below median observed in the far southwest.
