         I thank the senator for his question. We on this side understand the importance of strong credible fiscal strategies. We understand the importance of acting as the government did during the global financial crisis—putting stimulus into the economy saving 200,000 jobs. That is still opposed by the opposition, but 200,000 Australians and their families are kept in work by the actions of this government, a government that since 2007 has seen the creation of over 750,000 more jobs. But we also know that the global financial crisis ripped a hole in government revenue—some $130 billion worth of revenue losses over five years, something papered over by the opposition, something they want to ignore and pretend did not happen.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government put in place a clear strategy to return the budget to surplus. We said that we would exercise restraint in spending and we did. We said that we would keep taxes below what we inherited from those on the other side and we are. We have been making the hard decisions to reprioritise expenditure, delivering net savings to the budget. We have one of the strongest fiscal positions in the developed world. But what do the other side have to offer the Australian people? Negativity and a $70 billion black hole, just to get back to the starting line. On this side we offer jobs and a clear fiscal strategy; on that side a $70 billion black hole.

It says something about their economic credibility and how much they really care about ensuring this economy comes through this current volatility on global markets. We on this side understand the importance of a strong fiscal strategy; that is why we on this side, in the face of the global financial crisis and global recession, have kept public debt to extremely low levels—7.2 per cent peak net debt, less than one-tenth of the average of most advanced economies.

                 Clarity in fiscal strategy is always important in times of global uncertainty, and that is why the government has maintained a clear fiscal strategy. Regrettably that is not something that any longer has bipartisan support. What we have on the other side is a shadow Treasurer who one day blithely says they will get back to surplus earlier and then says he is going to oppose budget savings measures—and then he had to eat humble pie because he could not find alternative savings measures. We also appear to have a communications spokesperson, Mr Turnbull, calling for a sovereign wealth fund, a proposition that the shadow finance minister has said is incorrect. You have to ask who on that side actually speaks for the coalition when it comes to economic policy. Certainly the Australian people know only one thing and that is that those opposite have a big $70 billion black hole.
