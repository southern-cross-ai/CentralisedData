        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. Can the minister update the Senate on Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout as part of the national plan agreed by national cabinet, particularly in relation to older Australians?

         Thank you, Senator Brockman, for your question. Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues to ramp up, as we said it would. More than 19.3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have now been administered in Australia. Over the weekend, around 380,000 people rolled up their sleeves and got a jab to protect themselves, their friends and their families and to protect their country. Yesterday, a further 277,000 doses went into arms of Australians. I thank every single one of those people for going out and getting vaccinated, and I encourage all Australians to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
         While your home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , Senator Brockman, has very low COVID infections, the vaccine rollout is forging ahead in Western Australia too so that, when the time comes, WA can join all the states and reopen to the rest of the country and to the world, which is going to be very important for us all. We've got on with the job of protecting our most vulnerable Australians, with our older citizens first. More than 87 per cent of over-70s are protected with a first dose. We have done this because we know that elimination of the virus is a fallacy and that vaccines are the answer to us living with the virus, not in fear of it.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a national plan that states and territories have agreed on to open up at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates progressively. If we don't stick to the plan, the cost in terms of lives and livelihoods, as we're hearing right now, will be unacceptably high. Jobs will be lost; businesses will close.

          I'm pleased that you think that's funny, Senator; I really do. I think that's outrageous. The debt burden will rise and the wellbeing of Australians will suffer. Vaccines are the path to safety and living with the virus into the future.

                 I'm pleased to report that the vaccination rate of our workforce who care for our most vulnerable Australians is climbing each and every day, and 78 per cent of the aged-care workforce in residential care have had at least one dose of the vaccine. National cabinet agreed that the COVID-19 vaccination of residential workers would become mandatory by mid-September. The

                 has been working with each residential aged-care facility to ensure they have plans in place and provide support where needed to ensure that every residential aged-care worker has access to the COVID-19 vaccination. There are a number of channels open to them to get vaccinated, including the government's inreach services, vaccinating their own staff, and using Commonwealth and state vaccination clinics,

                    That's a very important question. The Australian government is making rapid antigen tests available to residential aged-care and home-care services delivered through the Commonwealth Home Support Program in high-risk local government areas of concern across Sydney and western

                    . Rapid antigen testing is not an alternative to vaccination, but it does provide an extra layer of defence in that it helps to detect COVID-19 in people without any symptoms of COVID-19. Applications are open and remain open to receive rapid antigen test kits. To date orders have been dispatched to 128 sites in Sydney and New South Wales. Kits will be distributed under the National Medical Stockpile arrangements. The TGA has published guidance, including a checklist, to help businesses with the implementation of COVID-19 rapid antigen point-of-care testing in the workforce.

                    <p class="italic">
                     We know that the federal government's vaccination program at the start of the year identified the Indigenous communities as part of the 1A rollout, and it hadn't occurred, and that's something that they lost attention of ... we know earlier in the year the rollout wasn't anywhere where it needed to be.

                    <p>
                     Why did the Morrison-Joyce government lose attention and fail to ensure these communities were vaccinated, as planned, many months ago?

I'm going to insist that, when I call individual senators to order, they stay silent for a little while, because I can't hear the answer and I have had numerous complaints from those attending remotely that, with the volume in the chamber, they can't hear the answer.

                                        As Senator Birmingham indicated earlier in the day, we have acknowledged that the vaccination rates need to increase. As of today, 216,724 Indigenous peoples, or 37 per cent, have had their first dose and 20.5 per cent, or 118,886, have had their second dose. The numbers aren't high enough. We need to continue to work on this. We've done that through a number of programs. We have sought out influencers to support vaccination in those communities. Unfortunately, there have been some very influential voices that have been anti vaccine in some of those communities. We have to turn those attitudes around, and we will continue to do that in support of getting not just
