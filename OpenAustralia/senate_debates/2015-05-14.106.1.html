           Well, Senator Hanson-Young, yes I can, but can I say at the start that the problem that you have identified, and this was a very, very serious problem, is a problem that Australia no longer has. It is a problem that Australia no longer has—no thanks to you, or to the Labor Party, by the way. It is a problem that was solved by the Abbott government, in the teeth of your opposition and in the teeth of the opposition of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           . Let me remind you, Senator Hanson-Young, that, in the six years of the previous government, policy supported by you saw more than 50,000 illegal entrants attempt to arrive in Australia on leaky boats, saw more than 800 leaky boats seek to make the dangerous journey across the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Sea" rel="nofollow">
            Timor Sea
           </a>
           , and saw more than 1,200 deaths. That is a humanitarian problem—a terrible humanitarian problem—that Australia had, and was shamed by, but no longer has because of the policies of this government.
          </p>
          <p>
           Turning directly to what is happening on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_Sea" rel="nofollow">
            Andaman Sea
           </a>
           , in relation to the Rohingya and Bangladeshis stranded there on boats: this is a regional issue demanding a regional response. The foreign minister has had talks with regional governments about the need to find a solution to managing the challenge of large-scale movement of people from Myanmar, and the foreign minister raised the matter in Thailand last week.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
            The Abbott
           </a>
           government welcomes the Thai government's plan to hold a regional officials meeting to address the situation. Australia will attend that officials-level meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
           I should inform you, Senator, that Australia has provided a total of $10.7 million for urgent humanitarian assistance for the people in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakhine_State" rel="nofollow">
            Rakhine State
           </a>
           in Myanmar, including many Rohingya. Peace and security are essential for the country to achieve long-term stability and economic growth, and Australia, through its aid program, is contributing to that.

             What I can tell you is what we have done in responding to the specific tragedy, and that is, as I said in answer to your primary question, the provision of some $10.7 million of urgent humanitarian aid, and, as well, our attendance at the regional summit. I am advised that Australia has not been approached directly for assistance of the kind that you mentioned.

               . The assistance that Australia is providing is financial assistance in the form of the $10.7 million package I described to you. The Indonesian authorities and the Malaysian authorities are dealing with the search and rescue aspects of this tragedy, but, of course, Australia is engaged with the issue. We are keeping the matter under review with an alert eye to further opportunities to be of assistance.
