        My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Senator Scullion. Will the minister inform the Senate how the government is working to address the issues currently affecting the youth of Australia?

         I would like to thank the honourable senator for the question and her long-term commitment to youth involvement in government decision making. She is probably closer to youth affairs in this place than many here.
        </p>
        <p>
         As many would have recognised, last week the members of the 2007 National Youth Roundtable were announced—46 new members, young people, young leaders from throughout Australia. I have gone through the members’
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CV" rel="nofollow">
          CV
         </a>
         s, and it is just delightful to see—and should be something that gives great confidence to this place and to all of Australia to see—that we have such a great cross-section of young leaders, which is a tremendous legacy.
        </p>
        <p>
         This year’s Youth Roundtable incorporated the National Indigenous Youth Leadership Group. I am delighted to say—and it is probably a reflection on the quality of the membership—that 477 applications were received, with the 46 members being chosen to represent a very wide diversity of Australians. Again, through their CVs, I note that they are from almost every region, representing both metropolitan and remote Australia, and that there are 12 new Indigenous members, two returning from the National Indigenous Youth Leadership Group.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was with some disappointment that I read some concerns, primarily from those opposite, that the amalgamation of the National Indigenous Leadership Group and the National Youth Roundtable was somehow a slight on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australia
         </a>
         . The facts speak for themselves. While we have notionally nominated 12 positions on that body for Indigenous people, based on merit alone there are going to be 14 Indigenous people on the Youth Roundtable. I think it is an absolute credit to Indigenous Australia that we have so many fantastic leaders coming up in that area. I am looking forward very much to working with members of the group, listening to their views and ideas and incorporating their aspirations and visions for our future into the government’s policies and programs.
        </p>
        <p>
         A further initiative that is happening in Canberra this week, and something that I know will be of great interest to those opposite, is the ABC Heywire program. The Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has long been a supporter of Heywire. I commend the ABC for this initiative and highly recommend all senators to take the opportunity, if it is available, to meet with this committed group of young Australians. In years gone by it has been tremendous to see the non-partisan support right across this chamber that has been given to the Heywire program.
        </p>
        <p>
         This week 35 young people are in Canberra as part of the Heywire program for the annual Youth Issues Forum. I will be meeting with these 35 winners of the Heywire program while they are in Canberra and I very much look forward to discussing issues of importance with them. It is groups like the National Youth Roundtable and the ABC Heywire finalists that provide valuable advice to government on the needs and aspirations of young Australians. The Australian government is firmly focused on delivering today’s sound policies that will continue to drive our economy and our society forward in the future, providing opportunities for future generations. I commend the National Youth Roundtable to all Australians and I encourage all young Australians to apply for the 2008 membership of the Youth Roundtable.
