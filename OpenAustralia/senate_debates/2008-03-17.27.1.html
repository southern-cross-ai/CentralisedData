        My question is directed to Senator Faulkner, the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel. Can the minister update the Senate on the search for

         I thank Senator Forshaw for his question. I am pleased to inform the Senate that one of Australia’s most enduring maritime mysteries has been solved. Yesterday, Sunday, 16 March, the final resting place of the missing
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Navy
         </a>
         cruiser
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         was discovered. As I am sure all senators would know, in 1941, HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         was the most famous of the Royal Australian Navy’s ships. She had created headlines with her exploits in the Mediterranean. But on 19 November that year, following a fierce action with the German raider
         <i>
          Kormoran
         </i>
         off the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          West Australian
         </a>
         coast, HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         was lost with all 645 crew. Over 80 German sailors also died. It was in fact the most grievous loss of life ever suffered by the Royal Australian Navy, and until yesterday the families of those crew members did not know the final resting place of their loved ones. Now they know. It is obvious to all of us that that knowledge will remind many Australians of their loss. More than 60 years may have passed, but I am sure that the loss is still felt. I am also sure that the condolences of all of us go to the families of the crew of HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Finding the location of the German raider, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSK" rel="nofollow">
          HSK
         </a>
         <i>
          Kormoran
         </i>
         , was the key to finding HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         . The
         <i>
          Kormoran
         </i>
         was found approximately 112 nautical miles off
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steep_Point" rel="nofollow">
          Steep Point
         </a>
         in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . It is lying in 2,500 metres of water. The Australian government has advised the German government of the find. HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         was found around 12 nautical miles from the wreck of the
         <i>
          Kormoran
         </i>
         . It was also lying in some 2,500 metres of water. This position fits with the testimony about final sightings of HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The location of the wreck and its dimensions do give certainty that HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         has been found. It is important now, I am sure all senators would agree, that we move to protect the site of the wreck of HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         . The Minister for Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts has declared both sites to be historic shipwrecks under the Historic Shipwrecks Act, thereby preventing any removal or disturbance of the shipwrecks without formal approval.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to acknowledge all those involved in the search for HMAS
         <i>
          Sydney
         </i>
         , and thank them for their great efforts. The

         has done research work over many years to identify the most likely location of the wreck: it organised the current search. The crew of the

         <i>
