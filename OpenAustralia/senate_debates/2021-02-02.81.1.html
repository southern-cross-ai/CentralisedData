        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. On 7 September Mr Morrison promised that 'Australians will be among the first in the world to receive a COVID-19 vaccine'. With 60 countries having commenced vaccinations and more than 100 million doses of the vaccine already given, how can the Morrison government claim it has delivered on this promise?

         What this government is doing is what we said we would do, which is to manage an orderly rollout of vaccine and manage the rollout of a fully approved vaccine, starting very soon with the arrival of the Pfizer product after the TGA approved that vaccine. And we will continue to manage that orderly rollout.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have to say, it's really disappointing that the Labor Party continues with their completely reckless commentary with respect to the vaccine. We have at all times managed an orderly process through accessing an appropriate number of vaccine candidates, going through an appropriate and full approval process to ensure that Australians can have confidence in the vaccines that we are looking to provide to Australians. The confidence that Australians have in the vaccines that we have available is going to be absolutely crucial to the take-up of vaccines across the country and to the protection of Australians, particularly those who are most vulnerable. So we will continue our orderly and structured process for the provision, approval and application of vaccines that we have started. We have continued to be honest with the Australian people with respect to the rollout and the availability of vaccines, and we've brought them on responsibly, not like the Labor Party, who've continued with this reckless commentary, which will only undermine confidence in the vaccination process.

          I have a supplementary. On 5 November Mr Morrison declared that Australians would be 'at the front of the queue'. Can the minister confirm approximately 60 countries are in front of Australia? Which queue was Mr Morrison referring to?

             My point of order is direct relevance. The minister was asked a very short question which included the Prime Minister's assertion to the country that Australians were at the front of the queue. We would invite the minister to respond to the question, which is: which queue was the Prime Minister referring to?

              I was listening carefully to the minister's answer. I can't instruct the minister on either the part of the question or the terms in which he answers. However, it was a relatively narrow question. I'm going to consider the minister to be directly relevant if he strictly confines his comments to the distributional rollout, for lack of a better term, of the vaccine, but I am listening carefully to his answer. Senator Colbeck.

                  The Pfizer vaccine is being provided to Australia in accordance with the contractual arrangements that we signed with Pfizer for the take-up of the vaccine. Under those arrangements, shipment of the vaccine was conditional on our approval of the vaccine, so we are receiving the vaccine in accordance with the contractual arrangements that were made with the manufacturers of the vaccine. When the vaccine arrives, it will be batch tested to ensure that it meets the requirements that it's specified to have and then it will be made available to Australians.

                       On the point of order, I have ruled before that, when there are strictly drafted questionsâ€”and I do consider this one to be one without pejorative phrasesâ€”political observations on the opposition are not directly relevant. Senator Colbeck, you only have two seconds remaining. I'll ask you to continue.
