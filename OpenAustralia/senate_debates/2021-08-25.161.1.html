        and Chief Health Officer argued that people aged 12 years and above should be factored into the vaccination rate required for reopening. Given that 38 per cent of cases in the ACT are children under 17, and around 30 per cent of COVID-19 cases in

         actually believed that, why did he agree to the Doherty modelling at national cabinet, which was agreed by all of the premiers, which includes vaccination and consideration of vaccination rates for proportions of the population? Of course vaccination for children is important. It is more important,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         . But the ACT Chief Minister sat in national cabinet and agreed to the targets in the Doherty modelling. If he wanted to change it, why didn't he do it then instead of in a press conference?
        </p>
        <p>
         He can do it on Friday when national cabinet meets again. There will be further information on the Doherty modelling presented to national cabinet on Friday. That's public information, so if the

          Chief Minister of the ACT
         </a>
         wanted to change the parameters of the modelling with respect to the vaccination rollout, why didn't he do it in national cabinet? Why does he do it publicly in a press conference or get Senator Keneally to ask a question in question time? He's sitting in a chair at national cabinet, which gets to make the decisions. Why doesn't he ask the questions there? Why doesn't he propose the modification of the parameters at that point in time? Why doesn't he do that? He is one of the few people that gets to sit in national cabinet. He's one of the few people that gets to be a participant in those decisions, so why doesn't he use the forum that he has available to him to actually put those inputs into that process?

           The Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children as young as 12. If the Morrison government had ordered more Pfizer last year, would Australians aged 12 to 19 now be vaccinated?

             CHO

            does actually believe in vaccination of children, and I have to say I congratulate New South Wales on the work that they have done, particularly with respect to vaccination of senior high school students, which frees them up to sit their very important examinations towards the end of the year. I congratulate the New South Wales government and the CHO on actually taking action to put in place the convictions that they clearly have. Congratulations to them on doing that. What this government has done and will continue to do is to work collaboratively with the states to deliver the national plan for the rollout of the vaccine in accordance with the health advice and of course in accordance with the national plan for opening up the Australian economy.

              Is the reason children aged 12 and above are not included in the targets that Mr Morrison did not order enough Pfizer last year to vaccinate 12- to 15-year-olds?

               The reason that they're not in the targets is we actually don't have an approved vaccine for them or ATAGI advice to support the rollout of vaccine to them. The Labor Party come in here continuously putting false premises to the parliament, but they are also trying to undermine public confidence in the vaccination rollout program. We continue, as we've done all the way through, to act on the health advice. We don't yet have ATAGI advice with respect to the vaccination of children between the ages of 12 and 15. We are expecting it very soon.
