         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
          IMF
         </a>
         predicts that the deficits of advanced economies will rise to an average of seven per cent of

          GDP

         in 2009. The fact that those opposite still do not understand the severity of the global conditions and do not understand how that impacts on deficits in Australia is an indictment of those opposite, because it is very relevant to talk about world conditions when you are talking about how long Australia will be in deficit. That is why it is relevant to this answer. The fact that those opposite do not like that does not make it irrelevant to the question, because the state of the international economy bears directly on the length and the severity of the impact on the Australian economy. It goes to the heart of the question that those opposite are asking.

         As I noted yesterday, government tax revenue has collapsed by $75 billion over the forward estimates since MYEFO and $115 billion since the budget. In the midst of this global recession, it would be irresponsible not to act swiftly and decisively to support jobs and invest in nation building. The reduction—

           , I raise a point of order and it relates to the standing order requirement that the minister be directly relevant to the question in his answer. He was asked very specifically a timing question—how many years the Australian budget will remain in deficit. So far he has not addressed that at all.

            , on the point of order, this is exactly the difficulty that these questions pose. The good senator, Senator Conroy, is providing a directly relevant answer to the question. The difficulty, as always, is that the framing of the question suggests an answer—in this instance what it does is try to pin it down by asking how many years. But, if you listen to Senator Conroy’s answer, the answer provides the answer. In other words, Senator Conroy is directly answering the question by explaining about the global financial crisis, how countries around the world are in—

              The global financial crisis around the world leads to a recessionary outcome. What Senator Conroy is explaining for those opposite, which Senator Coonan does not seem to grasp, is the way the process will go forward—but I do not want to debate the matter. The simple fact is that the question presupposes an answer. Senator Conroy is on point and is directly relevant to it.

                                , on the point of order raised by Senator Coonan, firstly Senator Conroy was attempting to answer that question in the time available and was responding to the question. In speaking to this point of order, Mr President, I draw your attention to the fact that, since the new system of question time was introduced, members of the opposition make commentary before asking each question and supplementary. If they are going to argue for relevance, I think we also ought to make sure that there are questions and that it does not turn into a taking note debate, because at the rate we are going there will be about three questions at question time.

                                 , in your examination and ruling, I would invite you to consider what commentary there was in the supplementary question that Senator Coonan asked, which was, very simply: what is the official government projection of the annual interest repayments on Labor’s new debt? It was very straightforward with no commentary—a direct question that, under the new standing orders, now deserves and indeed requires a directly relevant answer.

                                    that is true, Senator—that were to be asked by the opposition. My additional point of order is to make this point: this is a very specific question and, given the nature of the changes, the opposition has taken the relevance point but failed of course to deliver on what Senator Ferguson first proposed, which is an indication to ministers of the broad nature of questions that would be asked. Do not argue relevance when you have not delivered on the other element of what you designed as a new question time arrangement.

                                     , on the point of order: if Senator Faulkner is correct, then either Senator Conroy’s answer should be a figure or he does not know and he will take it on notice and get back to us. He does not need to give us the spiel and spin that we have become used to from Senator Conroy. So I agree with Senator Faulkner, and Senator Conroy should just say he has not got a clue and that he will take it on notice and get back to us.
