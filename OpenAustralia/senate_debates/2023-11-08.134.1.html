        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and the Minister for Homelessness, Senator Farrell. The Albanese government is delivering on its wide-reaching housing agenda to boost housing supply for Australians who need it most. Can the minister update the Senate on the work the government is doing to deliver on its ambitious housing reform to improve the accessibility and affordability of housing for Australians?

          Yes—after a decade of inaction they have to be! They need to be! We're taking action to provide support for all Australians looking for a place to call home—homebuyers, renters and those looking for a safe space to spend the night. With every step of our agenda, we're improving access to safe and affordable homes for Australians through measures which include: the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund; the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator; the $2 billion in additional financing for community housing providers; a $1.7 billion one-year extension to the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement; and the boost to Commonwealth rent assistance. We're already seeking homes under construction, thanks to the $575 million we unlocked from the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, and we have recently committed a further $1 billion to this facility to deliver even more homes. Just last week, the Albanese government, through Housing Australia, announced its largest investment ever, providing more than $500 million in federal government support to build 1,370 new homes in Melbourne.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is what a government that's working for Australia looks like—one that's working for renters and working for homeowners. It's working so much more so that Australians can have a safe and affordable place to call home.

            I thank the minister for his answer. It is encouraging to hear that the government is investing in a much-needed boost to the supply of social and affordable rental housing. Is the minister able to provide an update to the Senate on what the Albanese government is doing to strengthen renters' rights?

             I thank Senator Walsh for her first supplementary question. Yes, I can, Senator Walsh. We were elected with an ambitious housing agenda, and it's been complemented by the significant steps that we are taking to strengthen renters' rights. Work by the states on a better deal for renters is underway, improving rental regulations through nine agreed actions to improve conditions for renters. We have boosted Commonwealth rent assistance with the largest increase in 30 years. Alongside our reforms to increase the supply of new social and affordable rental homes, these measures will make a real difference to the lives of renters right across Australia, including the more than 680,000 renters in Senator Walsh's home state of Victoria.

                I thank Senator Walsh for her second supplementary question. The Albanese government is not just boosting the supply of new homes; we're also helping people—Australians—buy their first homes. Our first home buyer guarantee has now helped more than 73,000 Australians into their first home, including more than 10,000 in regions through the regional first home buyer guarantee. Senator Walsh, this includes more than 15,600 new homeowners across your state of Victoria helped into their homes by the home guarantee system. Our expanded home guarantees are good for young people, good for essential workers and good for any Australian looking to buy their first home.
