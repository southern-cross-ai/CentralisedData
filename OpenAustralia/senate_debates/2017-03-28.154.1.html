        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It is obvious to people in this chamber that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGowan" rel="nofollow">
         McGowan
        </a>
        Labor government was swept into power a couple of weeks ago in Western Australia—in fact, a tsunami of seats were won—because the McGowan Labor government offered a fresh approach. They are committed to reducing the disgraceful debt that was run up by the Barnett Liberals, and they are fighting for a fair share of the GST. The McGowan Labor government has promised to do that against a backdrop of complete inaction by Western Australian Liberal MPs and senators on speaking up for Western Australians on the issue of the GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is needed is a fairer distribution of the GST. These Liberal MPs and senators have consistently let down Western Australians. They have failed to deliver for their state. It is not as if they are backbenchers. In fact, the only person I have ever heard talk about the GST is Senator Dean Smith, a Western Australian Liberal senator. He has spoken out, but he too has failed miserably in getting a fairer share of the GST for Western Australia. But at least Senator Smith has spoken out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us talk about the senior Liberals who are not backbenchers: two are in the junior ministry, four are cabinet ministers and two members help comprise the four-person leadership group. They are very, very senior people within the Turnbull government, but, since 2013, they have sat on their hands and zipped their lips when it comes to WA's share of the GST. As I said, they have repeatedly left it to Senator Dean Smith, who also, along with them, has failed to deliver. But one could argue it is much harder for a backbencher and far easier when you are a senior player in the Turnbull government. But none of them have ever spoken about it, and they have left Western Australia to just flounder on its own.

        Less than 35c in the dollar is WA's GST allocation, and it is a problem. And it is not just a problem for WA but also for the national parliament. Of course the GST distribution is a difficult issue, there is no doubt about that, and one where each state and territory has a vested interest in getting the greatest share of the GST for their own state. We all get that, we certainly get that, but that does not mean the federal government just ignores it. The over-representation of WA MPs and senators in senior roles in the Turnbull government does not mean they can put their heads in the sand and fail to represent the interests of Western Australians on the GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new McGowan state Labor government is hot to trot on this issue, make no mistake. It will not go away quietly on the issue of the GST. Western Australian Liberal MPs and senators, particularly those in senior positions within this government, can no longer ignore this issue. The recent wipe out, the tsunami, of the Barnett government came—one way it came about was because it was out of touch and arrogant. That should be a lesson for the federal Liberal government. All of those seats it now holds in the House of Representatives are under threat, and this issue is a hot topic for Western Australians. If they ignore the media, the editorials, the letters in the newspapers, then they will be going the same arrogant way that the Barnett government went. The issue of a fair distribution of the GST will remain an issue for Western Australians, but I doubt very much whether the out-of-touch current federal MPs and senators will see that. It is time the Turnbull government either put up or shut up on this issue.
