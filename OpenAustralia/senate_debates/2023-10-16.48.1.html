         I thank Senator Ciccone for his question and I acknowledge his deep interest—along with many others on this side of the chamber and, I think, across this parliament—in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

         peace. As I have said many times since these awful events unfolded on Saturday, the attack by Hamas was a shocking assault on Israel and on the Jewish people. We unequivocally condemn these attacks. We understand how distressing they are for not only the Australian Jewish community but communities everywhere. We call for the immediate release of hostages. There is no justification for this attack. And we recognise Israel's right to defend itself and to re-establish its security.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said earlier today, Hamas is a terrorist group that rules Gaza with no regard for the safety and security of the Palestinian people who live there. Hamas's actions have precipitated a devastating situation in Israel and Gaza, and civilians are suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia's principled position in all contexts is to call for the protection of civilian lives and the observance of international humanitarian law. Why do we do that? These are principles that protect everybody. This is why we have seen widespread calls across the international community for the protection of civilians.
        </p>
        <p>
         In response to the rapidly-deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, Australia is providing an initial $10 million in humanitarian assistance, through trusted partners, for civilians affected by the conflict; for water, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene services; and to support medical treatment for the victims of the conflict. We also call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza and the rapid establishment of a humanitarian corridor. We want to ensure essential humanitarian relief can reach civilians. And, again, we commend the work of many in the international community towards this goal.

            after the initial attack. On Monday, I directed my department to assess all options for Australians wanting to leave. We secured commercial options for assisted departures and readied the ADF to assist, should commercial options no longer be viable. As of this morning, more than 1,200 Australians previously registered have left Israel and the

            , including more than 400 Australians and their families on four Australian government flights. I would like to ensure I make this information public: subject to factors, including the security environment, we are planning two additional flights to Dubai today, and we have secured flights for onward travel from London and Dubai. We continue to assist more than a thousand registered Australians and 39 consular cases.

               Australians are distressed by what they have seen, what they are watching and what they have lost, and we know that this conflict has touched many Australians and is felt most acutely in our Jewish communities and our Palestinian communities. I would make this point: there is a long, complex and disputed history to this region. It is deeply felt. It is close to the hearts of many. It is why I have continued to urge all to express their views respectfully, as have the Prime Minister and other ministers in the government. We should be clear: there is no place for antisemitism in this country, there is no place for Islamophobia, there's no place for prejudice and there's no place for hatred of any kind. We must maintain mutual respect here at home, and politicians have a role in that: to speak and behave in a respectful way regardless of difference.
