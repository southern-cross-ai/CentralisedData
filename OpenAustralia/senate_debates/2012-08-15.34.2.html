        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Bob Carr. Is the minister aware of reports of whether substantial cuts to defence announced in the May budget have resulted in a decision to no longer supply the iconic rising sun badge as part of the uniform that Australian soldiers have worn since 1901? Are these reports true?

          units have reported that they are not being given live or blank rounds for training exercises, and instead are shouting 'bang bang' to simulate weapons discharges? Is it true that the Army Reserve training days are being cut from 100 to 21 per member per financial year to ensure that available ammunition will actually meet operational needs?

           I am happy to assure the Senate that the Army advises there is no shortage of blank or live ammunition. Ammunition has not been affected by budget cuts. Army training, whether through dry drills or through the use of blank or live ammunition, continues to be effective.

           The 2012-13 defence budget was developed following a comprehensive review of the department's budget to identify contributions defence could make across the forward estimates to support the government's broader fiscal strategy. The decisions taken to determine defence's contribution to the budget bottom line have all been carefully designed to protect our service men and women and our defence operations, and to minimise the impact on core capabilities. This contribution will have no adverse effect on operations taking place, whether in Afghanistan or elsewhere. The short answer is, 'No, they are not', and that is the only—

             , my question, which the minister did not even attempt to answer, was: is it true that Army training days—that is, Reserve training—are being cut from 100 to 21 to allow for the limited ammunition to be available for operational needs? He did not answer that question. He did not even refer to it.

                     , I rise on a point of order. The point of order is relevance. The minister has already, in effect, taken the question on notice by saying that he would seek advice. He cannot now relevantly be permitted to go on to personally attack and reflect upon the senator who put the question.

                       , on the point of order: the minister is 20 seconds into his answer. He is perfectly entitled in answering the question to address issues raised in the question. He is providing an answer to the Senate and the situation is where the opposition continues to try to shout him down and then take points of order after having sought information. Quite frankly, it makes a mockery of question time. They ought to allow the minister to complete his answer.

                           He started with the absurd allegation that soldiers were required to say 'bang, bang' instead of firing bullets, and he is wrong. The Army itself advises him and advises this house that the allegation is absurd and entirely wrong. He has no credibility on his subsequent questions. He suggests that the Army is disposing of historic badges of enormous significance to Australians.
