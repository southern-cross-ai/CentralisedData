        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Attorney-General's confirmation yesterday that his office had been 'aware some months earlier' of Commissioner Heydon's intention to speak at a

         with me, so I will remind you what I said. I said, when you asked me a like question, I became aware on Thursday morning. I instituted an inquiry. My office had become aware some months earlier and apologised on my behalf because I had already, at the time that my office received the date claimer notice, accepted another event which was in the diary. That is the position.

          , I ask a supplementary question. The Attorney-General did not answer, so I re-ask why his office took no action when they became aware Commissioner Heydon was addressing a Liberal Party function. Can the Attorney-General also explain to the Senate why yesterday he said he was 'concerned' about the commissioner delivering the Barwick lecture?

           Senator Wong, can I give you some advice? If you are going to paraphrase, paraphrase accurately, because you have not done so. First of all, in relation to the first part of the question, I did not say my office became aware that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           Liberal Party was promoting the function. I said that my office had received a date claimer notice, and, contrary to what you have asserted, my office did take actionâ€”that is, they sent an apology on my behalf. In relation to the second part of your question, I was concerned because I had seen the press reports on Sky News that morning and I knew that Labor Party politicians were causing a political controversy about the matter.

             Again, if you are going to put these propositions it is best to get your facts right. You use the word multiple. I suppose three is a multiple. Three emails in the space of 18 monthsâ€”

            <p>
             I have seen three. Three in the space of 18 months does not strike me as being a huge flurry of emails. Secondly, I might say that the only reference to the
