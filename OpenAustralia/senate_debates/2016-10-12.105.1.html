         I thank Senator Back for his question. Australia's 2016 Defence white paper identified the security and stability of Australia's immediate neighbourhood as our highest strategic priority after the defence of Australia. Australia's aid program has a key role in promoting a safe and stable neighbourhood and wider region. Our aid complements our diplomatic, trade, defence and policing activities. Our support helps our regional partners to be peaceful, democratic, well governed and to follow the rule of law.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we know, the causes of instability and conflict can be complex. That is why Australia's aid program is well targeted where it can make the biggest difference. We work to strengthen law and order, reduce conflict, fight corruption and improve access to justice. We have a strong record, and this was very much demonstrated by the achievements of the Regional Assistance Mission to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         , called
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMSI" rel="nofollow">
          RAMSI
         </a>
         . RAMSI has been a Pacific success story and over 13 years has helped to rebuild law and order institutions, stabilise government finances in that country, restore business confidence and create the conditions for development and economic growth in the Solomon Islands.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, as the largest country in the neighbourhood, we are the principle security partner for our Pacific neighbours. Under our Pacific Maritime Security Program we are providing replacement maritime patrol boats to 12 Pacific island countries from 2018. Through our aid program we are also supporting neighbouring countries to counter terrorism and violent extremism.
        </p>
        <p>
         For long-term stability, governments need to provide security as well as services and economic opportunity, and aiding priority areas enables economic growth, which in turn—

            Regional stability makes Australia more secure. As I indicated, the Defence white paper makes it very, very clear that a stable and secure region will help Australia be more secure.
           </p>
           <p>
            By promoting stability, our aid is actually making Australia safer. Weak and fragile states struggle to deal with transboundary health and security challenges—for example, drug-resistant tuberculosis. By helping countries meet these challenges, our aid is helping to prevent threats which ultimately affect Australia by spreading to Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, our stability encourages economic growth. Instability is a major constraint to growth in our region. It reverses those gains that can be achieved and sets countries back by decades.

               Instability in our region has strategic consequences for Australia. Therefore, by working to build stable and secure societies we are helping to counter violence, we are helping to counter radicalisation and we are helping to counter transboundary threats that can affect Australians and our national security. Our programs are well targeted. About 90 per cent of our aid is directed to the Indo-Pacific region, especially in our immediate neighbourhood of South-
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_and_the_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
                East Asia and the Pacific
               </a>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Instability is a brake on growth. By helping to remove this brake, our aid supports economic activity in our region, which in turn leads to more trade and investment opportunities which not only benefit our neighbours but of course benefit Australians as well. By investing in the resilience of communities, we are also helping their long-term stability.
