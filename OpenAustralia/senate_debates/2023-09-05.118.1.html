        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Watt. Last year's Secure Jobs, Better Pay reforms were passed to get wages moving again for Australian workers and to reinvigorate Australia's enterprise bargaining system. Despite wages increasing, worker wages and conditions are still being undermined by some employers who rely on loopholes within the Fair Work Act. What are the loopholes that some employers are using to undercut worker pay and conditions? And how is the Albanese government acting to close those loopholes?

         Thank you, Senator Sheldon. I want to recognise your long career, along with many members on this side of the chamber, in fighting for workers' rights and fighting to close loopholes that see people being ripped off at work. It's good that we now have a government in Australia that is taking these issues seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Sheldon, I have good news for Australia: I am pleased to say that wages are moving again in Australia and that employers are back at the bargaining table, thanks to the Albanese government's Secure Jobs, Better Pay reforms.

           They really don't like the idea of workers getting a fair go, do they? If there's anything they hate more, I'm yet to find it! As I said, their happy place is cutting workers' wages and stopping legislation to fix it. That's where we're back to.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Sheldon, as I said, the Albanese government promised to fight for workers' wages and we are delivering. Here is what we've already delivered in just 15 months: an 8.6 per cent increase for the national minimum wage this year—the largest increase on record; a 15 per cent increase for aged-care workers—aged-care workers who the former government refused to do anything about; the gender pay gap is at an historic low of 13 per cent; and wages growth has improved, increasing by 3.6 per cent over the year to June 2023 and 3.7 per cent over the year to March 2023. And the opposition have moaned and bleated every step of the way, just as they continue to do today.
          </p>
          <p>
           But the reality is that loopholes do remain within the Fair Work Act which undermine worker pay and conditions. If a worker steals from an employer, it's a crime—as it should be. But if an employer deliberately steals from their worker, in most places in Australia that is not a crime. If a worker steals from an employer, it is a crime, as it should be. But, if an employer deliberately steals from their worker, in most places in Australia it is not a crime. So the Albanese government is acting to close this loophole by criminalising wage theft. We're also ensuring labour hire workers are paid at least what they would be paid if they were employed directly. We're empowering the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards for employee-like workers in the gig economy. We're about closing loopholes, and the opposition should support us.

                  Thank you, Senator Sheldon. We know that, over the last couple of weeks, we've had a whole lot of Johnny-come-latelies who've all of a sudden decided to take an interest in Qantas. But there are some people, like Senator Sheldon,

                   Senator White
                  </a>
                  , Senator Sterle and others, who have long careers in standing up for the workers of Qantas to make sure that they're treated fairly. They're not Johnny-come-latelies; they're people who've actually got records of standing up on these issues. These loopholes that Senator Sheldon is complaining about impact Australians every day, and they create a race to the bottom on wages. They undermine negotiated pay and conditions, and they undermine the integrity of the enterprise bargaining system.

I am more than happy to review the tape, but you were being disorderly.

The Albanese government will not allow Australia to become a country where you have to rely on tips to survive, and the opposition should back us.

                              Last year, those opposite saw the title of 'secure jobs, better pay' and knew they were against it. Again, this year, they've seen the title of 'closing loopholes' and—guess what?—they're against that, too. What was the former coalition government's legacy on closing loopholes that have continued to undermine worker pay and conditions?

                               That's a very good question, Senator Sheldon. Last year, we heard claims from Senator Cash that the secure jobs, better pay bill would 'potentially close down Australia'. It looks pretty open to me! It has not closed down. On 4 September, before the secure jobs, better pay bill had even been written, Senator Cash claimed that our government's reforms would 'have the potential to take us back to the dark ages, to close down parts of the economy'. They'll be having leeches out doing medical treatments next, like they did in the

                               . We'll be having Knights of the Round Table in Senator Cash's world.

                               Whenever Labor does something to get wages moving again, you can rely on the catastrophising and hyperbole from Senator Cash and the rest of the opposition. The former government had almost a decade to take action to close these loopholes. Instead, we had Mr Fletcher calling the labour-hire loophole essentially a made-up issue. Low-wage work was a deliberate design—
