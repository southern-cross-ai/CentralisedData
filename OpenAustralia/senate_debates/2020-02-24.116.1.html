        My question without notice is to the Minister representing the Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure, Senator Cash. Can the minister confirm that the Urban Congestion Fund will provide funding for projects in every Liberal seat in Melbourne, including $240 million for the seat of Higgins, while the seats of Gellibrand, Lalor and Maribyrnong in Melbourne's west will receive nothing?

         I thank Senator Carr for the question. Senator Carr, you would be aware that Urban Congestion Fund projects will be funded in Labor seats. This is a $4 billion fund, as you know, and it is all about bringing to life 166 crucial projects. Construction will start on 70 of them this year. Four are already underway, with geotechnical investigations and other preparatory work underway on many more. As the Minister for Finance has stated—

            I didn't catch every word in the question. I remind the minister of that part of the question. I believe—and I'm happy to be corrected—there was an earlier part that asked the minister to confirm funding about seats more generally as well.

             Senator Carr, I can confirm that these are election commitments made by the government. You may have forgotten, but the Australian people voted in May last year to re-elect the coalition government. As a result, these decisions of the government are now being implemented. I can confirm in relation to Victoria the following: $70 million for the Northern Lines commuter car parking, in the seats of Calwell and

                       On the point of order: the only assertions contained in the question, which we're happy for the minister to respond to, were that there's $240 million for the seat of Higgins and nothing for Gellibrand, Lalor or Maribyrnong. That's a pretty reasonable set of facts for the minister to respond to, and she hasn't responded to them. Direct relevance,

                        I have taken some advice from the Clerk because I admitted a second ago that this is not a question I managed to get notes of. You reminded the minister of the question. I do believe that, if asked a question about seats in Melbourne receiving funding under this program, it is directly relevant for a minister to answer that by asserting other seats in that same location were part of the program. But I am listening carefully to the answer, as I appreciate the question was specifically asked. You've reminded the minister of the specific nature of the question. I ask her to continue keeping that in mind. Senator Cash.

                             They are not competitive grants. There is a fundamental difference between what those on the opposition side of the chamber keep yelling out and what they actually are. You may not like it, but these were commitments that we took to the election—just like you took commitments to the election: Labor's election commitments. I believe that every single election commitment that Labor made that we're aware of was in Labor or target seats. The fact of the matter is you still cannot get over the fact that the Australian people endorsed the plan of action that we took to the election. They endorsed the plan of action that does see funding go to Labor seats. They endorsed the plan of action that takes into account a number of factors.

                                        I completely reject Senator Carr's characterisation of the funding of these projects. We took this plan to the Australian people. The Australian people looked at our plan and said, 'We trust the coalition government to implement an urban congestion fund that is actually going to make a difference where it counts.'

The fact of the matter is that this was a plan endorsed by the Australian people that is vital to busting congestion in Australia.
