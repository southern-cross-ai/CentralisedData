        My question is to Minister Wong, representing both the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment and Water. Four hundred and fifty gigalitres of water was promised under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and the environment, but the Liberal and National parties have monumentally stuffed up the delivery of this water, at the expense of taxpayers and the health of the river. In the election campaign, the Albanese government promised and committed to delivering the 450 on time and in full. Is this still your government's commitment?

            , and so is Senator Hanson-Young. I apologise for the Constitution, Senator! But the reality is this: the Minister for the Environment and Water tabled the second
            <i>
             Review
            </i>
            <i>

            report and, just like the member for Hume, who hid a price rise for electricity, this was also hidden to the Australian people before the election. You know why? It was because what it showed was the decade of sabotage that those opposite have engaged in when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.
           </p>
           <p>
            They promised 450 gigs. You know how many they delivered? Two out of 450! We know why: they never wanted to deliver it. They never wanted to deliver it, and we know that because the National Party are still saying that and came into the chamber, whilst in government, and tried to blow up the Murray-Darling plan.
           </p>
           <p>
            I invite Senator Birmingham, as the most senior
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">

           <p>
            I will get to it—to rein in those on that side who continue to want to sabotage this important reform.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have made clear that Labor is committed to delivering the basin plan in full. It's what we signed up for. The minister has made it clear that that remains the approach. But I would say this: it has become a great deal harder now that it has been disclosed that you delivered two out of 450. Why did they think it was okay to hide that before the election? I'm not surprised you take a point of order.

                  I again hear the interjections from the National Party. We wonder why the coalition never delivered on this. I remember, when I was water minister and I bought a lot of water, how angry they were that we actually bought water for the environment from willing sellers. Oh my goodness! Isn't it dreadful to use the market to deliver an environmental and social outcome! It's a dreadful thing, isn't it?

                    The Minister for the Environment and Water confirmed yesterday she has written to and is speaking to basin water ministers because, obviously, we have to work with the states in order to deliver this. Minister Plibersek has also tasked her department to consult widely on creative and collaborative approaches on how we can deliver the plan in full. I say this: nothing is off the table, including voluntary buybacks, because it is clear that the approach that was taken on the other side did not work.

                        The report commissioned by your government, which you hid prior to the election, says these targets cannot be met under the settings you put in place. You can't meet them under the settings you put in place. It is the easiest thing, isn't it, for a politician to go upstream and downstream and say different things to different communities and pretend they're going to do something. At least tell people the truth. I accept you don't agree. I accept you don't agree with our position—

                            The report indicates there are not enough off-farm projects to reach the 450 gigs even with unlimited time and money. So clearly a different approach has to be taken.
