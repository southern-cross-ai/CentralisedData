        In the latest Tasmanian election Jacqui Lambie Network candidates ran on transparency and integrity. What we learned is that Tasmanians do not trust the Liberal and Labor parties any more. If you look at the results of the last federal election, I don't think Australians trust the major parties either. Independent candidates who on integrity and transparency were elected in record numbers. This government ran on accountability and transparency and integrity. You promised the Australian people that if they voted for you you would deliver. All we have seen here since you were elected is bills being rammed through with little or no consultation, as usual dropping it on us at the last minute. When the Tasmanian Liberals were attacking the Labor opposition leader for not revealing whom she spoke to about the

        stadium, the Attorney-General of Tasmania,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Barnett" rel="nofollow">
         Guy Barnett
        </a>
        , said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hiding behind the pretence of confidentiality simply doesn't cut it. This is about honesty. This is about integrity. This is about telling the truth.
       </p>
       <p>
        He actually managed to say this with a straight face. What Mr Barnett didn't say was that it was his government that signed a deal with the AFL under the cover of darkness. They didn't consult with Treasury, TasWater or key stakeholders.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also the Tasmanian Liberal government who fought tooth and nail to prevent the Tasmanian people from knowing which 22 people and eight institutions face potential adverse findings by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_of_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">

        into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to

        in Institutional Settings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, back in the federal parliament, the Albanese Labor government has resisted multiple freedom of information requests to disclose the Prime Minister's diary. The Labor government that was promising integrity and transparency is getting stakeholders to sign an unprecedented number of non-disclosure agreements, and this means that the government will show these stakeholders legislation but they're not allowed to discuss it with anyone else. I would recommend to every Liberal and Labor MP that you go to bed every night with a copy of the 2022 election results. Remember that was your lowest primary vote yet, and there'll be more to come if you continue on this road.
