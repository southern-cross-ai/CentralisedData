        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Nadia Sievewright was a young nursing student when Centrelink hit her with debts totalling $25,000. She was told by Centrelink that, if she wanted to contest them, she would need to pay lawyers to fight in court and that, if she lost, she might go to jail. Doctors suspect that the stress of interacting with Centrelink aggravated her autoimmune condition, causing her to be hospitalised on multiple occasions. Nadia even received calls from Centrelink when she was eight months pregnant. The government has conceded that the robodebt scheme developed by Mr Morrison was unlawful. Does the government now accept that it was also wrong to illegally hound vulnerable Australians like Nadia to the point of desperation?

              I'm happy to rule on the point of order. Senator Keneally, the question had a substantial preamble. The minister was 20 seconds in. I could barely hear his answer, although I did hear the quote that you're objecting to. I'm listening carefully, but I do believe that is directly relevant to the substance of the question asked. I ask Senator Cormann to continue.

                     , Nadia Sievewright's case has been raised with the opposition. We asked whether it was wrong to illegally hound vulnerable Australians, like Nadia, to the point of desperation. I understand there are politics at play. The minister has had his fun quoting Labor people about a different scheme, but I ask him to be directly relevant to that issue. She deserves an answer.

                      I say on the point of order that I'm not in a position at this point in this chair to make a ruling on whether something was part of a particular program. The question asked the minister for information. In my view, the information he was responding to that with is directly relevant and does directly address the question. There is an opportunity to debate this matter after question time. Senators can avail themselves of that. Senator Cormann.

                       . As Ms Plibersek and Mr Bowen said, the government has a responsibility to recover debts where people have been overpaid and, as Mr Shorten said, the automation of this process will free up resources. I also should say that, of course, the government recognises that the recovery of debt has to be done in a way that is lawful and that is why the government has made the decisions it has since announced.

                          It is always preferable for people to come to an arrangement to settle their debts. That is absolutely preferable. In the context of people not engaging with Services Australia, that raises administrative issues which were recognised when Labor was in government. There were errors made in relation to the automation of the income compliance program. These will be addressed, and the government has made relevant decisions to address them.

So what is Mr Morrison's response to the human cost of the system he designed and implemented as social services minister in 2015?

                             There is nothing wrong with the government seeking to recover outstanding debts where there have been overpayments. That is something that has happened under governments of both political persuasions, and, indeed, the previous Labor government was considering the automation of this process. Mr Shorten was advocating in favour of the automation of this process. That is a matter of public record. These arrangements have to be put in place in a way that is consistent with applicable laws, and that is what we will ensure will happen.
