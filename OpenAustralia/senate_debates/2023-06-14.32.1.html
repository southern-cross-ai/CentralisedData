        state so well over so long, is that a member of the Tasmanian Labor Party, Fay Gervasoni, worked for him for a long period of time. She talked about his commitment to the Labor movement. She spoke about his involvement with the Labor Party over such a long period of time. She was still heartbroken even though he passed away at the age of 88—that's still too early, I would think—but I thought it was fitting because of the way Fay felt about him, and the fact he was such a good boss, and that he was a role model for so many others. I'm sure that, in the condolence motion, there were people who eloquently talked about his contribution.

        He was married three times, which I think is—that's an effort! He had a son and a daughter. I've only done it once and, personally, I think once is enough—but each to their own! As I understand it, he rose through the Labor movement. I think it's indicative of people who have transitioned through the Labor movement that, once they are a union person, they are always a union person. I didn't take that tour into the Senate or politics, but I was raised by parents who believed in the Labor movement and unions, which has helped shape who I am.

        It also should be noted that Bruce was very passionate about social issues—the
