        Firstly, I would like to congratulate the new ministers on their appointments; I hope that they have better luck tomorrow in finding their seats as they move up the chain. My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister explain why the Prime Minister conspired to keep the former Minister for Ageing’s trading in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        io shares a secret? Why did the Prime Minister not advise the parliament and the public of the issue in October last year when he first became aware of the minister’s clear conflict of interest? Why did he agree to do nothing himself and allow Senator Santoro to finally lodge an incomplete and misleading declaration in December last year—some two months after raising the issue with the Prime Minister? Why did the Prime Minister not insist that the declaration advise the full truth about the CBio shares purchase? Didn’t the Prime Minister fail in his duty to enforce his own ministerial code of conduct and ministerial standards of accountability? Aren’t the public entitled to conclude that the Prime Minister will only act on breaches of his ministerial code if the matter is exposed in the public arena?

         The Prime Minister obviously insists upon all ministers complying with the ministerial code of conduct. It is my understanding that ours is the first government to have such a ministerial code of conduct. The Prime Minister can rightly be proud of the fact that it was he who introduced such a code of conduct and that he ensures that all ministers understand their obligations under his code of conduct to declare their pecuniary interests to him and maintain the contemporary nature of that declaration. All ministers are, of course, also bound by the resolutions of the House of Representatives and the Senate, which also require them to register their pecuniary interests and to maintain them.
        </p>

         It is now obviously well known to one and all that Senator Santo Santoro did neglect to ensure that both the Senate register of interests and the register of interests with the Prime Minister were kept up to date. He has paid the ultimate price for that neglect and tendered his resignation last week as the Minister for Ageing. Could I take this opportunity to commend Senator Santoro on the work he did as Minister for Ageing. I have not heard one word in all the time that has expired on this issue that is derogatory of his actual performance in the ministry—indeed, there are many who have proclaimed the virtue of the very strong performance that he put in as the Minister for Ageing. None of the events that have occurred go to his performance in that role. I think he can rightly be proud of his service since January of last year in that demanding and difficult portfolio.
        </p>

         The Prime Minister acknowledged that, once the issue of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB" rel="nofollow">
          CB
         </a>
         io had been raised, Senator Santoro dealt with it properly. He wrote immediately to the Prime Minister once he became aware that he had not declared that particular interest. He issued instructions for the shares to be sold. He issued instructions for the profits to go to another organisation and not to himself, and he changed the Senate register accordingly to ensure that it registered that interest and the disposal of that particular interest. It is clear that CBio could represent a conflict and that is why those shares were dealt with as they were. The Prime Minister and his office made it clear to Senator Santoro at the time those matters were drawn to his attention that he must ensure that his declarations of interests to the Prime Minister and to the Senate were full and complete. The Prime Minister has properly executed his responsibilities in ensuring that that former minister and all ministers comply with the rules.

          , I ask a supplementary question. The minister failed to answer the key aspect of the question: why did the Prime Minister not make public the conflict of interest of his minister when he was advised of it? Why did he allow the minister a further two months before he updated his pecuniary interest register? Why did he allow Senator Santoro to make a declaration which was not full and frank, which was misleading about the dates of the purchase of the shares, and therefore continued to mislead in this matter? Surely the Prime Minister had a responsibility to be open, honest and transparent rather than to allow Senator Santoro to continue to mislead regarding the nature of his share holdings and the dates of their purchase?

           As I said, the Prime Minister was informed by Senator Santoro of this parcel of shares which had come to his attention. Senator Santoro informed the Prime Minister of the course of action which he intended to take, which involved the declaration of that interest on the Senate register. As the Prime Minister indicated last week, the Prime Minister was satisfied with the proposed course of action as outlined by Senator Santoro, and Senator Santoro undertook that course of action.
