         Senator Hanson-Young, are you going to deal with amendments (1), (2) and (3)? On sheet 7791, you have amendments (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5). Are you going to deal with them in that order? I understand that Senator Carr's amendment is to Greens' amendment (4).

          That is correct. Given the nature of these bills, I will follow the pattern I have in recent times—that is, I will speak to all of these amendments so that we do not have to get up and down. The position will not change. It is unlikely to persuade anyone of anything on this matter. So I think we will just state our position.

           I would like to start with my amendments in relation to releasing children from detention. My understanding from sheet 7791 is that the first two amendments deal with 3A section 4AA and 3B subsection 5(1).

             As I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, these amendments go to releasing children from detention. We know from the statistics released by the department on 30 October that there are 112 children held in immigration detention here in Australia. We have heard over and over again from the experts, medical professionals and practitioners, that the detention of children is extremely harmful. Only last month the medical community, including doctors, nurses and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Medical_Association" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Medical Association
             </a>
             , called on our parliament to act swiftly to remove children from indefinite detention.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some would be watching this debate this morning and wondering why on earth we are still debating this issue, when 12 months ago there was a very similar discussion about releasing children from Australian facilities. Sadly, there are still over 100—the latest statistics showing 112—children detained in Australian facilities. These amendments would release these children by Christmas and they would ensure that families are kept together. I understand that there are a number of amendments to the Greens' amendments that the Labor Party wish to move to ensure security and safety of the community as well as the families involved, and I welcome those amendments as put forwarded by Labor's spokesperson, Senator Carr, in this place.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is time. Some of these children have been in detention for years and years. They are incredibly damaged as a result. Children are not developing as they should and young babies have not been able to grow at the normal rate because of the negative physiological, emotional and social impact of their detention. One of the doctors at the Melbourne Children's Hospital described one of these children as 'the youngest depressed person' the doctor had ever seen—and it was a six-month-old baby. No-one in this place should be advocating—and I do not believe does advocate—directly for the detention of children. These children currently held have been there for way too long. It is a national shame that we have kept them locked up; that we have effectively stolen this amount of time from their childhoods. It is time that we right this wrong and release this children once and for all.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is one little girl in detention who is now seven years old. She has been in detention for 2½ years. She suffers significant post-traumatic stress disorder. At the age of five or six, she attempted to swallow razor blades. She cannot sleep. She has nightmares. Her parents complain of her wetting the bed. The trauma that she has endured from being locked in these facilities is not something that we can pretend we do not know about. We know that the damage to children from detention is significant. We knew it last time children were detained, under the Howard government. We have seen it over and over again in independent reports and inquiries, but most importantly in the medical reports that are written about these children by their doctors, their paediatricians and their expert psychiatrists and clinical teams.
            </p>
            <p>
             In years to come we will be asked what we in this place did to ensure the protection of these children—when we knew that the detention of them was harmful. I urge all members in this place to act today to support an amendment which requests the minister to remove these children from detention and to house them securely and safely in the Australian community, where they can start to get better, where they can integrate into their communities and where their parents can start being mums and dads properly again. These children deserve us as a parliament today to stand for them and to act for them. We are only speaking about 112 children—and some would say, '112 children out of how many others?' We have the power today to remove those children from detention, to stop any further suffering and to ensure that they are no longer put in harm's way.

             If indeed there is a reason that they must remain in detention, we should have that argument put before a court and ensure that the minister has to justify their continued detention. I find it hard to see how anyone can justify the detention of a six-year-old, or a six-month-old, or a 16-year-old—a little boy or a little girl who has done nothing wrong apart from being a victim of the world they have been born into and the circumstances they have endured. These children deserve a voice in this place, and we today can give them a voice and give them the protection that so far has been denied to them. I urge all of my colleagues in this place to move to release the children currently in detention here in Australia immediately and to ensure that they can be living in the community free from harm by Christmas.

              I raise a question. The matters we had before us go to children in detention. Senator Hanson-Young has moved amendments (1) and (2). Is it her intention to move amendment (5) separately? Should it not be dealt with in this same category? The reason I ask that is that we will be opposing amendment (3) and seeking to amend amendment (4). I am concerned that, because there is no running sheet here, it is difficult to assess the subject matter. My reading of those amendments, though, is that they all go to the same issue—that is, children in detention. I am wondering why amendment (5) has not been moved at this point and whether that is the intention of Senator Hanson-Young.

                 I will indicate the opposition will be supporting amendments (1), (2) and (5). The principle that should apply here is that children should only be in detention for as long as is necessary to complete health, identity and security checks. We also take the view that families should be kept together wherever possible. I think it is possible to reconcile those two principles. We would say, though, that if one or more parents, or a guardian, of a child has received an adverse security assessment by
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                  ASIO
                 </a>
                 , the minister should not be required to make a determination. In such a case, a child should be able to choose whether or not to remain in detention with the parent or guardian. Further, when a child is moved, the minister must be satisfied that a child's new living conditions will be better than their existing circumstances. Therefore we are seeking to have amendments made, which we will do when it comes to consideration of amendment (4), according to those principles I have outlined.

                 <p>
                  Clearly, everyone does want children out of detention, but I will say a couple of things. One is that we have had circumstances where people have had an adverse security assessment and, when it has been put to the families or the guardian to take the child out of detention, the decision has been made to keep the child in detention. That is a matter for the guardian or the parent. We cannot forcibly move children out if their guardian or parent wants to keep them in detention. I think that we need to be cognisant in this debate that, as a Commonwealth or as a government, we cannot just take the children out if their guardian or parent does not wish them to be removed from them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I go back to the point I originally made. I would remind Senator Hanson-Young that under the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
                   ALP
                  </a>
                  -Green coalition, you supported Labor's policies. When Labor were in government, there were over 10,000 people in detention including almost 2,000 children. So let us put those figures again on the record. Under the coalition government, the number of children in detention has been reduced to about 100. I also remind the Senate that the Migration Act already contains a provision which states that a minor should only be detained as a measure of last resort. Therefore, these provisions already exist. If the Greens want children out of detention, the facts show that under our policies there have been fewer children in detention. The government opposes amendments(1), (2) and (5).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also, we believe this amendment is unnecessary. There are already processes in place to mitigate any risk of non-citizen detention, including children, becoming unlawful or arbitrary through internal administrative review process, judicial review, Commonwealth Ombudsman inquiry processes, reporting and parliamentary tabling, and ultimately the possible use of the minister's personal intervention powers to grant a visa or to make a resident determination with the minister considers it is in the public interest.

                   I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the level of community support for these amendments to be removing children from detention. Just this morning, I had a meeting with five members of the Grandmothers Against Detention of Refugee Children telling me about the work they are doing in their communities, listening to their communities and expressing the concerns of the community about the fact that we have ongoing detention of children here in Australia and on Nauru because the harm being done to these children is unnecessary. There is no place for children to be in detention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This afternoon I will be presenting a petition from the Wills branch of the Grandmothers Against Detention of Refugee Children which has 2,550 signatures on it. The women I met with today told me that Grandmothers Against Detention of Refugee Children is growing. They have 1,200 members in Victoria. They are spreading across Australia and they are hearing a level of concern in the community about children being jailed, being harmed and being damaged. Passing these amendments today will mean, if enacted, that children will be removed from detention. There would be a great level of support across the community because people know it is unacceptable to have this ongoing harm being done to innocent children.

                    Sorry to be out of place. This is a further problem with not having a running sheet here. Our support for these amendments is in fact conditional on the fourth one, which is now the fourth item, being dealt with and amended, which I understand is acceptable to the mover—the amendments we are proposing. Although this may be technically tricky, I might suggest to Senator Hanson-Young that she seek agreement of the Senate to move amendment (4) before the other amendments are dealt with, to allow us to process that matter.

                      This amendment goes to releasing children from detention, ensuring the minister uses the power he already has to allow families to be given a residence determination—that is, where it is safe to do so, where it is able to happen, children and their families can be moved from detention facilities into the community securely and safely. It is the practical element to ensuring that children can be released from detention.

                     <p>
                      This amendment also goes to the issue of mandatory reporting. I spoke about this in my speech in the second reading debate. This is to ensure that where there is criminal activity or a child has been abused, where abuse has been witnessed, whoever is working in the facility is required by law to report that abuse. It is the same standard that we set in our schools and in our hospitals and of professionals working in other public institutions. If we are serious about ensuring that children are safe in immigration detention facilities or in any government institution, then wherever abuse is witnessed or known of, it should be reported to the police. There should be no hiding for the perpetrators of abuse. We know what happens when perpetrators get to hide: their abuse festers and the people who suffer are the children. It is important that we have a very clear understanding: if you are in a facility and you see abuse, you are required not to stay silent, not to let the abuser get away with it, but instead you are required to act in the best interests of the child to ensure they are protected from the perpetrator.

                         The proposals that Senator Hanson-Young has outlined here are, in general terms, worthy of the support of this chamber. When the bill creating the Australian Border Force was before the parliament, Labor maintained that the legislation did not prevent staff and contractors in detention facilities from speaking publicly on conditions in the centre. We are still confident that that is the legal position. There is no intention, as far as we are concerned, for the suppression of potential whistleblowers, because staff and contractors continue to be protected by the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Disclosure_Act" rel="nofollow">
                          Public Interest Disclosure Act
                         </a>
                         . The disclosure restrictions of the Border Force Act relate to criminal investigation, national security and other sensitive matters; they do not concern comments that might be made about the treatment and the living conditions of detainees. Nonetheless, Labor supports these amendments because they will make it absolutely clear that disclosures in the public interest are lawful and protected, and I understand that this was a position that we carried through the Senate inquiry on that matter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The second issue goes to the issue of media access. Labor has always opposed the excessive secrecy with which this government has chosen to cloak the administration of the offshore detention facilities. I know there are now extraordinary costs being imposed by other governments that nonetheless I cannot believe have been put in place without consultation with the Australian government.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Asylum seekers are human beings whose rights must be respected. This includes being housed in a place of safety with access to adequate health care, social services and educational opportunities. Equally important is the right of the Australian people to know what is being done in their name and at great expense. They are entitled to know how Australian funded facilities are being operated. That is why we support this amendment which will ensure that reasonable requests for media access to a detention facility will be granted, and that any refusal must be tabled by the minister. There must be public disclosure and accountability. I have noted in regard to the amendment on media access that Labor has consistently condemned the government's mismanagement of offshore processing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The government places detainees in living conditions that lead to all forms of abuse. Nearly two years after their arrival, asylum seekers in the Nauru detention facility were still living in tents. Increased sexual abuse and assaults were an inevitable consequence of having to live in that environment. That is why Labor instigated a Senate inquiry into the reports of sexual abuse on the Nauru facility. Labor would establish an independent oversight of the detention facilities to ensure transparency and the protection against abuse. The member for Corio has introduced in the other place a private member's bill on mandatory reporting of offences against children. Therefore, we support the amendment on those grounds as well, which makes it absolutely clear that assaults and abusive conduct are not acceptable in Australian funded facilities. This amendment will mandate the reporting to relevant authorities of any assault, just in case there is any question about those matters—and failure to report such matters would be an offence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The question of discretion then arises. It strikes me that while we need the proposition that Senator Hanson-Young has moved here, it does require a clearer statement that the minister has a responsibility to show common sense when it comes to the question of these administrative arrangements. There needs to be ministerial discretion and there needs to be accountability. These two things go together—that is why this parliament has such an important role in ensuring transparency in the operation of these facilities. So the amendment I am moving allows ministerial discretion when it comes to the minister being satisfied that refusal to make a determination on one or more of the various subsections is in the best interests of the minor, and that it is in the public interest to do so. The amendment I am moving also allows that, where the minister has been given an adverse security assessment in regard to a member of a family unit, they are still able to be treated in a proper way according to law.

                          I will respond to both Senator Hanson-Young's amendment and to Senator Carr's amendment. I can make the general comment that the government opposes these amendments and that they go beyond the scope of the policy intention of this bill. This amendment includes reference to detention facilities in regional processing countries which cannot be supported under the Migration Act. The Australian government does not detain people offshore—this is a matter for overseas governments.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I will now go specifically to residence determination for minors. The minister already has a level of discretion available under section 197AB to make a residence determination, and will continue to use that discretion as appropriate and in the public interest for a person who is detained. Also, section 4AA already provides that the parliament affirms as a principle that a minor shall only be detained as a measure of last resort. In relation to mandatory reporting of assaults, reporting of incidents is already comprehensively provided for in the onshore immigration detention environment. Serco must inform the department of incidents in accordance with the incident management reporting requirements as set out in the contract. Reportable assaults include assault of a client under 18, minor assault, serious assault, sexual assault. Each of these is well defined and has a minimum time frame within the incident must reported by Serco to the department. Departmental officers must, under current operating arrangements, report alleged criminal activities, including assault, to the relevant law enforcement authorities.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          In relation to disclosure of information related to detention facilities, this bill does not propose changes in relation to information related to immigration detention facilities or access to these facilities. It proposes amendments to ensure that confidential information that is relevant to the exercise of a section 501BA or 501CA power in the context of court proceedings receives the same level of protection from disclosure as confidential information relevant to the other character powers. This is a legitimate measure to protect the information in the context of court proceedings and it is a legitimate community protection measure.

                           Public Interest Disclosure Act
                          </a>
                          is the Commonwealth's statutory regime for disclosure of information in the public interest. Any disclosure under the Public Interest Disclosure Act would give immunity from criminal liability under section 42 of the Australian Border Force Act. There is nothing in the bills before the Senate preventing disclosure that is inconsistent with the Public Interest Disclosure Act.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I turn now to reasonable access for journalists. There are a number of oversight mechanisms for the monitoring of immigration detention facilities, including the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                           Australian Human Rights Commission
                          </a>
                          , the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
                           Australian Red Cross
                          </a>
                          . Detainees have the right to provide feedback about their treatment in immigration detention without adverse consequences. Their feedback will be followed up quickly and fairly and can be submitted to the detention service provider or departmental staff at the facility, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the police, state and territory child welfare agencies and other agencies such as the Human Rights Commission.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The government opposes the amendments moved by Senator Carr. The government considers the amendment as unnecessary. As I have indicated, section 4AA of the Migration Act makes it clear that the government and the parliament affirms, as a principle, that a minor should only be detained as a last resort. There are already processes in place to ensure that detention of children is a last resort and decisions relating to children place importance on the best interests of the child.

                                    This amendment relates to the need to keep the different groups of asylum seekers who are detained in our facilities separate—to keep those who have committed crimes, people who are criminals, separate from those who have sought asylum in our country. I spoke about this at length during the second reading debate, so I do not propose to go into great detail now. Suffice it to say that many experts have suggested for a long time now that keeping those different groups separate is important for the safety of all involved, including the good order of our facilities.

                                    , that the people who suffered the intimidation and threats while that riot was going on were those who had committed no crime but were seeking Australia's protection as refugees. This amendment bans the government from keeping those two groups of people locked up together and instead ensures that groups are kept separate. It is a simple amendment. It makes sense, and we should just get on and ensure that it happens.

                                     might indicate the Labor Party's position, the best advice that we have available is that it is already standard operating practice for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to make a risk assessment when placing people in detention centres. I am advised that the detainees are assessed for risks that they pose either to others or to themselves, and therefore Labor will not be supporting this amendment. For a similar reason, we opposed a similar proposition that was advanced in earlier legislation by Senator Madigan. The amendment would merely place an unnecessary legislative restriction on the department and the Australian Border Force, which we believe is a matter left to the discretion of relevant officers, and they have to be held accountable for the decisions that they take, through the normal parliamentary and legal processes.

                                      The government opposes this amendment. We consider this amendment unnecessary. The government has a range of accommodation options available to manage people in immigration detention. Superintendents have a specific focus on security and safety of immigration detention facilities and use intelligence to determine programs that ensure the good order of each facility and the protection of people housed in the facility. This bill does not purport to change how the government currently manages people in immigration detention. The department has a process for triaging and placement of detainees into appropriate accommodation. Placement decisions are made as part of a national risk-based approach to the placement of detainees within the network. The detainees' risk assessment and the risk rating of a facility are considered to minimise risks to other detainees, service providers, visitors and staff. Individual detainee needs are considered in line with the department's duty of care to all detainees. Non-citizens who have had their visa cancelled because they have been convicted of serious crimes will be in immigration detention or serve their sentence in prison, depending on their individual circumstances.
