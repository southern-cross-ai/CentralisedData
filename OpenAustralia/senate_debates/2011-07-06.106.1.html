        In Question Time yesterday I offered to provide further detail to Senator Ludlam to answer a specific supplementary question he raised relating to James Price Point in the Kimberley.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the supplementary question, he asked: Does the minister acknowledge any Commonwealth responsibility at all for situation having deteriorated to the degree that we now have Aboriginal people being forcibly removed from country during

        week? Can the minister cite any action that he plans to take to defuse the situation, including, reviewing and revoking his decision not to assess the existing land-clearing proposals?

       <p class="italic">
        I can now furnish further information:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is aware of reports that the

         Western Australian Police

       <p class="italic">
        This is a matter for the

         Western Australian Government
        </a>
        . The Commonwealth Government's role is to protect matters listed under national environmental law and ensure proposals are assessed under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC
        </a>
        Act, as appropriate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is aware of calls to revoke the decision that controlled actions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These decisions, made by a departmental delegate, mean that work on the access track and the road does not need further assessment under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC Act
        </a>
        , if carried out in a particular manner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, these decisions still place conditions on the work to ensure impacts on the greater bilby are minimised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Claims that the proposed access track and the road have not been assessed are incorrect.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In fact, the minister's department did assess these proposals and placed conditions on the work to ensure it is carried out in a particular manner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The decision simply means no further federal environmental assessment is required, as long as these conditions are met.
