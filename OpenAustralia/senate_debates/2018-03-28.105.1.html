         I thank Senator Gichuhi for her question and her particular interest in excellence in teaching. Last week it was my pleasure to attend the Commonwealth Bank Teaching Awards, which recognise and reward 12 outstanding teachers and school leaders for the way in which they improve the learning outcomes of Australian students. That came hot on the heels of the recent Highly Accomplished and Lead Teacher Summit. The Highly Accomplished and Lead Teachers program recognises certified outstanding teachers whose practice sets a benchmark and provides an example of the real impacts that great teaching practice has on student learning. Professor John Hattie, of the University of Melbourne and chair of AITSL, and a range of international experts from the

               The ongoing work of AITSL in regard to the certification of teachers and ensuring that teachers can work towards being recognised as highly accomplished teachers, as lead teachers within their schools, is helping to lift practice and, indeed, is seeing, in many of those schools, those highly accomplished and lead teachers given the opportunity to mentor newer, younger teachers to take on more leadership roles and to be recognised for their excellence, without necessarily moving into principal, administrator or other positions.
              </p>
              <p>
               The government is also supporting enhanced improvements to the way in which teacher training occurs. The reforms, as a result of the TEMAG program, around initial teacher education are ensuring higher benchmarks for those leaving our higher education institutions in future, around the quality of their teaching practice. As has been discussed many times before, the Turnbull government is delivering record and growing funding into Australian schools, across all states, across all different sectors, providing an extra $25 billion, distributed fairly, according to need.
