         I thank Senator Hutchins. There is great mirth from the opposition, who did nothing in respect of national reform of regulation while they were in government. The Gillard government has a comprehensive agenda and reform to reduce the level of unnecessary and poorly designed red tape in Australia. This is in order to increase productivity, build a stronger economy and create more jobs and higher wages. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
          Council of Australian Governments
         </a>
         national partnership agreement is to deliver a seamless national economy and we are driving states and territories to deliver this seamless national economy in 27 key areas. The Gillard government is providing some $550 million in incentive payments to the states to tackle the 27 deregulation priorities that have been identified.
        </p>
        <p>
         The states and territories need to deliver the reforms, in line with the key milestones that have been established, by 1 July 2013 in order to be eligible for the incentive payments. Very good progress is being made, and let me provide a few examples. Standard business reporting allows business to quickly and efficiently prepare and lodge business information electronically through a range of Commonwealth and state-territory agencies. When it is fully operational in 2014 it will save business an estimated $800 million per annum in operational costs. Australian Consumer Law, which is operative from 1 January 2011, will replace 17 different state and territory acts of parliament in this area with a single national framework, which will be simpler and more comprehensive. National trade licensing will cover electricians, plumbers and property agents and will avoid the need for separate licensing in every state and territory.

           As I have already said, this is a very important reform process. It is about increasing productivity, building a stronger Australian economy, adding to jobs and adding to wages. Many reforms have been completed. A further example is the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions, a national system of trade measurement. Believe it or not, in a country such as Australia, we did not have nationally consistent trade measurement—and we were one of the few countries in the world not to have nationally consistent trade measurement requirements. There has also been the implementation of the regulation of trustee corporations. There are many reforms still underway. Occupational health and safety has certainly had some attention in the media of late, as has the introduction of the national system for registering business names. There is no national requirement for the registration of a business name in Australia—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the minister aware of any alternative policies to the government’s ongoing reform process, and do these alternative policies pose any real risks to our long-term prosperity?

             As I said earlier, when those in opposition were in government for almost 12 years they did little, if anything, in this area of a national seamless economy and the simplification of regulation. They did little, if anything. They are a policy-free zone. There were a policy-free zone in this area in government. They are still at policy-free zone. The reforms that I have outlined, at least in part, today are complex. They are time consuming. They do involve bringing together states, territories, business and a range of representative organisations, trade unions and consumer organisations, but they are extremely valuable to the strengthening of Australia’s economy. They are all about lifting productivity, improving productivity, strengthening the Australian economy and delivering more jobs and higher wages. That is the critical importance of these reforms. Unfortunately, those opposite have no ideas and are taking an extremely negative, wrecking attitude, as they have in every other—
