        [by video link] Fake Christians are the Judas goats of the 21st century. We have a fake Christian prime minister and, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , a fake Christian premier. Both are forcing the faithful to break their covenant with God or be destroyed, unable to provide for themselves and their families. Both are not ambassadors of God's light; both are harbingers of hatred. That the billionaires who own the world would advance these two men as their pawns says more about the billionaires than it does about Prime Minister Morrison and Premier Perrottet, who, we already know, are the elite's sock puppets. Elite billionaires clearly consider Christianity as nothing more than attendance at church and pious words. In the case of our Prime Minister, throw in a little happy-clappy Christian theatre. How little they understand us.

        The book of Matthew tells us that Jesus did not turn away lepers; Jesus healed lepers. In many such lessons throughout the Bible, Jesus was instructing the faithful: 'Purity laws that categorise and isolate others are not of God. Our inner beings, our hearts, must be pure, and purity involves the integrity of the whole person.' These teachings support religious objections to COVID injections.
       </p>

        If these fake Christians were indeed men of God, they would know this fundamental Christian belief and would defend the belief, not destroy it. There's nothing Christian in these men's actions. Maintaining this facade of Christianity leads the faithful away from God towards segregation, persecution and the destruction of our families and communities. That's the role of a Judas goat. The faithful will flourish. Those who desert their faith for antihuman corporatism will not. Perhaps this Christmas Scott Morrison and Dom Perrottet can contemplate Jeremiah, chapter 34, verses 8 to 22.
