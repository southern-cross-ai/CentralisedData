        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. Does the government intend to keep its solemn promise made to Australians saving for their retirement through superannuation before the 2010 election that it would 'never remove tax-free superannuation payments for the over-60s'?

         Could I thank the senator for his question. Unlike those opposite, those on this side of the chamber have always been the champions of the superannuation in this country. Those opposite now seek to spread fear and uncertainty. The far-sighted reforms that the former Labor government and current Labor government have introduced have been met with opposition from all of those opposite—both now and previously. Let me quote to you from Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Abbott

          , I rise on a point of order relating to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant. Australians saving for their retirement across Australia need the minister to be directly relevant to the question. The question was very specific: does the government intend to keep its promise that it would never remove tax-free payments for superannuants over 60—yes or no? Nothing else can be directly relevant to that question.

           Firstly, on the point of order, I cannot tell the minister how to answer the question. That has been a longstanding situation in this chamber.

           Order! If you did not interject and had waited, you would have heard the whole context of what I had to say. I cannot tell the minister how to answer the question. The next part I was going to say, if people had been patient and had waited, was that I draw the minister's attention to the question and the minister has one minute and one second remaining.

I know that I have subsequently asked the minister to address the question that is before the chair and the minister now has 13 seconds remaining to address the question.

                       My supplementary question is: why has the government cut the super co-contribution for low-income earners by $1,000, down from $1,500 under the Howard government to just $500 now, in particular given Labor's emphatic promise before the 2007 election that it would not make any changes to superannuation? Can the minister rule out any further cuts to the low-income earners super co-contribution in the next budget?

                         , it is breathtaking that those opposite seek to come in here and play rule-in rule-out games. The premise of the question is about playing rule-in rule-out games, yet Mr Abbott himself confirmed that one of the first things he would do if elected is to scrap a billion dollars' worth of the superannuation tax break for low-paid workers. Some 3.6 million low-paid workers would be facing having less money—$500 would be ripped away from Australian superannuants if those opposite got the chance to implement their policies. They want to come in here and start rule-in rule-out games to cover what Mr Abbott said last week. Let us be honest here, Mr Abbott said that he was going to do it—and we hear dead silence over there.

                          , I have a further supplementary question. Why should anyone trust that a re-elected Labor government would not scrap the low-earner super tax offset given Labor has tried to fund it by the mining tax, which has not raised any meaningful revenue? Why should anyone trust any commitment made by this government about superannuation given it has broken its promises made before the 2007 election and is about to break its most emphatic promise made to superannuants before the 2010 election?

                             Mr Abbott, a man who said he would not change Medicare before an election when he was the Minister for Health, and then in the first budget he made absolute cuts. Then, when he was asked in public—he was asked on the record, on television—did you think about resigning? He said, 'I thought about it for a minute but I decided not to'. So, do not come here and talk about trust.
