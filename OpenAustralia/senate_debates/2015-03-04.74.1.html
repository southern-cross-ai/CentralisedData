         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question. I can advise the Senate that I have now approved spending of $860 million over four years for projects through the grant funding round. This spending covers 1,297 projects right across Australia. These projects will support the Abbott government's key objectives in Indigenous affairs of getting kids to school, getting adults into work and making sure that communities are safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we came into government at the end of 2013, we brought most Indigenous-specific services into the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
          Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
         </a>
         . There were 150 separate programs and services. These myriad programs were burying providers in red tape, some employing staff specifically to meet the reporting requirements of government across multiple funding streams. We had to bite the bullet. We have streamlined those 150 programs and services into five programs. We could have stuck with the old ways, but, as the latest
         <i>
          Closing the Gap
         </i>
         report revealed, we are not getting anywhere near closing the gap. As the saying goes, if we keep doing things the same way, we will get the same result.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is not an approach that is good enough for this government—or indeed, I suspect, for this parliament. It is certainly not an approach that is good enough for some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. For the first time, this government has taken a holistic look at a whole range of services being delivered to support our first Australians in achieving their aspirations—aspirations which are no different from those of others in our community: a better future for the next generation.

             I do not think this government or parliament would pretend that there is a single silver bullet in this matter. I do not think the

              IAS
             </a>
             will provide that either. Nothing that any government does will lead to an instant reduction in Indigenous disadvantage. What it will do, however, is focus our resources in key areas that we know will make a positive and long-term difference to the lives of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
              Indigenous Australians
             </a>
             . Most importantly, it is part of this government's new engagement with Aboriginal and Islander people wherever they live in our major cities or in the most remote community.

             are now operating under a new regional structure with senior managers and staff much closer to the communities that they serve. They will work directly with community leaders and organisations to be part of a new partnership to deliver change for the better. This bill will work in particular communities to get children to school by asking the community about what they want us to do to help them. It will support our new approach to the Remote Jobs and Communities Program from July to get adults active and working every day.

               We have to be smarter and more targeted about how this money that we invest is spent. I do not think we would argue that there has not been a waste in this space and that resources have not met the outcomes that we all want to see for our first Australians.

               Taxpayers deserve to know that their investment is making a difference and that organisations receiving taxpayers funds are accountable for the money that they receive. We have simplified the process for organisations to receive funding and reduced the bureaucratic burden and reporting requirements. This allows organisations to get on with the job of delivering services on the ground for

                Indigenous Australians

               . Organisations that receive significant funding from the government will be required to meet new high standards that will be closely monitored and evaluated through these contracts rather than them having to report back to government. Aboriginal corporations will be supported by the
