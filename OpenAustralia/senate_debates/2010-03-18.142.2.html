        Commonwealth agencies are relying on long-established processes and, where necessary, enhanced systems to ensure public funds are managed appropriately.  A range of audit and compliance strategies have been put in place across programs.

        is also working closely with the states and territories to ensure their tendering and procurement processes demonstrate value for money.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The projects announced in the 2009-10 Budget, which form part of the Government’s longer term third phase of the stimulus, reflect advice provided by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        .  Infrastructure Australia made project recommendations to the Government following economic analysis against its publicly available assessment methodology of seven key themes.  These recommendations were guided by Infrastructure Australia’s national priority list of key infrastructure needs for Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fiscal stimulus measures have made an important contribution to this performance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In year-average terms, the Australian economy grew by 1.4 per cent in 2009. This compares to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
         IMF
        </a>
        estimate of an average contraction of 3.2 per cent for the advanced economies collectively. Without the fiscal stimulus, Treasury estimates that the Australian economy would have contracted for three of the four quarters in 2009 and by 0.7 per cent overall.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that Australia was one of only three advanced economies to avoid recession during the global financial crisis.  While full year growth data for 2009 is not yet available for all economies, it appears that Australia will prove to be the top ranking advanced economy for 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Compared to the major advanced economies, Australia has the second lowest unemployment rate (behind Japan).  Australia’s current unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent compares to double-digit rates reached in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        and European economies during the global recession.  Since the collapse of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers" rel="nofollow">
         Lehman Brothers
        </a>
        in September 2008, while all of the major advanced economies have recorded job losses, Australia has managed to create over 170,000 jobs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fiscal stimulus measures have been designed to ensure they do not affect the sustainability of the budget and are withdrawn as the economy recovers.  As indicated in the 2009-10 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the stimulus peaked in the June quarter of 2009 and the gradual phasing down is expected to subtract from growth through 2010. This means that Australia is withdrawing stimulus one year ahead of the timetable recommended by the IMF for advanced economies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some aspects of the stimulus have been recalibrated to allow flexibility in managing the demand for individual programs and to ensure an appropriate level of support is provided to the economy.  The Government has already announced re-phasing of some key components of the stimulus to ensure that the stimulus provides value for money.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government already has a robust reporting and accountability regime that includes: the requirements for all new spending proposals to be scrutinised by the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet; for costings to be agreed with the

        The stimulus measures have been designed to be withdrawn as the economy recovers.  As indicated in the 2009-10 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the stimulus peaked in the June quarter of 2009.  The staged withdrawal of stimulus measures, that is already underway, will detract from economic growth in 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also outlined its strategy for returning the budget to surplus as the economy recovers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government’s medium-term fiscal strategy is to achieve budget surpluses on average, over the economic cycle; to keep taxation as a share of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        , on average, below the level for 2007-08; and to improve the Government’s net financial worth over the medium term.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will pursue a disciplined fiscal strategy to return the budget balance to surplus by:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         (a)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         offsetting all new spending decisions taken since the 2009-10 Budget across the forward estimates by finding savings in other parts of the Budget;
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (b)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         restraining real spending growth to two per cent a year when the economy is projected to return to above trend growth (2011-12); and
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (c)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         banking increased tax revenue as the economy improves.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        The implementation of the Government’s fiscal strategy is expected to result in the budget deficit falling from 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2009-10 to 1.1 per cent of GDP in 2012-13, and returning to surplus by 2015-16.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government’s approach to phasing out the stimulus and other support measures is consistent with the position agreed by the G20.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The G20 has played a central role in facilitating a decisive and coordinated response to the financial crisis and subsequent recession involving the introduction of unprecedented fiscal, monetary and financial support measures.  As a result of these measures, economic and financial conditions have improved.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At their most recent meeting at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         St Andrews
        </a>
        on 6-7 November 2009, G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed on the need to avoid premature withdrawal of support measures.  At the same time, they also agreed to cooperate on the withdrawal of support measures when recovery is assured, including through information sharing and working together to address any adverse spill-over effects of individual country strategies.  At the same time, Ministers and Governors acknowledged that national plans will need to be implemented flexibly, taking full account of variations across countries and regions in the pace of recovery and financial market conditions.

         Government Response
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not consider it necessary to commission such a report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia’s stimulus was designed on the principles of best practice fiscal policy of being timely, temporary, and targeted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On timeliness, the Government responded quickly and decisively to the deterioration in the global outlook, implementing stimulus measures from October 2008.  The measures were temporary as they did not lock the Government into higher ongoing expenditure, thereby not affecting the sustainability of the budget and these measures are being withdrawn as the economy recovers.  Finally, the stimulus measures were targeted to ensure their effectiveness in boosting demand, in turn supporting jobs and economic activity.  The large capital component of the stimulus also addressed long-term needs for economic and social infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first phase of the stimulus was primarily focused on providing immediate support to the economy and a large proportion consisted of direct payments to households.  These payments were provided to low and middle-income individuals and households with dependent children.  These are most likely to be liquidity constrained households and/or at the stage of their life cycle where they are most likely to spend a sizeable proportion of any cash payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is now considerable evidence that the cash stimulus payments helped support the economy during its weakest phase.  For example, in January 2010 retail turnover was 7.5 per cent higher than the pre-stimulus levels of November 2008, having remained largely flat throughout 2008.  In addition, consumer confidence remains 43.0 per cent higher than the pre-stimulus levels of October 2008.

The model set out in the report resulted from twelve months of extensive community consultation across Australia including a national workshop of 100 Indigenous leaders and was based on the feedback from all of those consultations. The establishment of this body underpins the Government’s commitment to resetting the relationship with Indigenous peoples. It provides a voice for Indigenous peoples, the opportunity for partnership and the genuine engagement necessary if there is to be progress in closing the gap in life outcomes and opportunity.

        The Government also recognises the critical need for healing services to overcome the trauma of removal, the impact of colonisation and the associated intergenerational effects. The     2009-10 Budget provided $26.6 million over four years for the establishment of a Healing Foundation to address trauma and healing in the wider Indigenous community, with a focus on the Stolen Generations. This initiative addresses a major recommendation of the Bringing Them Home report concerning healing and rehabilitation, and will help individuals, families and communities to move forward.

        Since coming to office the Government has set a national priority to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.  Australian Governments have agreed to a number of ambitious targets for Closing the Gap.

        Through a range of initiatives the Government has responded, and continues to respond to, the Bringing Them Home report. The Government recognises that members of the Stolen Generations have particular needs. For this reason, the Government has allocated additional funds in the 2009-10 Budget to address the specific healing and family reunion needs of Stolen Generations members, supported by dedicated consultative mechanisms which ensure respectful participation in the implementation of those measures.

        On 26 May 2008, the Prime Minister announced that a forum of experts would be convened to map ways forward for healing among Australia’s Indigenous peoples, in particular the Stolen Generations. The Indigenous Healing Forum held on 16 and 17 September 2008 looked at the real impacts of trauma on individuals, families and communities, including children, and best practice models for recovery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In order to get a range of views on Indigenous healing and its potential applications, a very broad representation from the government, community and other sectors as well as members of the Stolen Generations were invited to attend and contribute to the discussion.

         WTO
        </a>
        ) obligations relating to non-tariff measures and, where appropriate, to eliminate the application of non-tariff measures that operate to restrict market access or impose undue costs on exporters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Non-tariff barriers to trade take a variety of forms and have varying impacts on trade.  The range of non-tariff measures applied by Australia’s FTA negotiating partners, and the impact of these measures on Australia’s trade with them, varies considerably.  The nature of such measures and their impact on Australian market access interests are always identified as part of Australia’s stance in negotiating FTAs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, determining a single “cost” of these measures would not be practicable, or necessarily meaningful, given the variety of different types of non-tariff measures.  The variety of measures means that a range of analytical tools are needed to analyse their effects.  While some measures (e.g. quantitative import barriers) may be susceptible to conversion to “tariff equivalent” measures, which can then be subject to reduction like normal tariffs, this approach is not appropriate for other measures (e.g. quarantine measures or technical regulations) which are best addressed through disciplines governing their application.  The following examples illustrate the variety of measures that could potentially be major non-tariff barriers:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         quantitative limits – or tariff rate quotas - on the volume of imports of agricultural products.  Such measures are required to be applied in accordance with WTO commitments.
        </li>
        <li>
         import licensing - which may be administered on either an automatic basis (e.g. for statistical purposes) or non-automatic basis (e.g. for the administration of tariff rate quotas).
        </li>
        <li>
         fees and charges associated with importation (or exportation) which are required under the WTO to be limited to the approximate cost of services rendered and not to represent an indirect protection of domestic products or taxation of imports (or exports) for fiscal purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
         restrictions on imports for specific purposes, e.g. bans or quantitative limits on imports of alcohol products for religious reasons, or on imports of particular types of weapons for public safety reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
         other non-tariff measures that may have an impact on Australian market access interests can include standards and sanitary and phytosanitary measures – which are also subject to WTO rights and obligations.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        A range of research and academic work has been done on measuring non-tariff barriers and assessing their effects, and Australian negotiators take this work into account in trade negotiations, including FTAs.  This work has proved valuable mainly as a research and analytical tool to inform negotiations.

       <p class="italic">
        The Department also regularly provides publicly-available assessments of the trade and investment relationship with partner countries including those with which Australia has negotiated FTAs.  Examples of these analyses include articles on Australia’s trade relations with FTA partners Thailand and the United States, available on the DFAT website.  In addition, information, statistics and resources on Australia’s trade partners, including FTA partners, is also available from the DFAT website and the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While liberalised market access provided for by FTAs can be very significant in influencing exporters’ commercial decisions, a number of other factors also impact on international trade flows, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, the health of the international economy and variations in economic growth in different countries over time.  It would not be possible to attribute differences in annual trade outcomes solely to the effects of FTAs.  Assessments of FTA impacts need to be both qualitative and quantitative and should be on a medium to long-term basis as many of the impacts of a trade agreement take a number of years to be realised (e.g. through new investment decisions).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the above reasons, the Government does not consider that annual reports by DFAT would be of value.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It should also be noted that the Minister for Trade reports to the Parliament at the commencement of an FTA negotiation.  This includes an assessment of the expected impacts of the FTA.  The Minister for Trade also provides the Parliament with regular updates on bilateral, regional and multilateral trade negotiations with significant developments through Statements to the Parliament.
