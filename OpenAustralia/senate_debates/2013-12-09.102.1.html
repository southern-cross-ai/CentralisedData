         Social Services

        , Senator Fifield. Can the minister outline to the Senate the coalition's plans to reduce the administrative burden on aged-care providers and how this reduction will allow aged-care workers to focus less on administrative tasks and more on providing high-quality care for older Australians?

         I acknowledge Senator Ruston's interest in social policy. It is indeed a priority for this government to cut red tape and to allow those who work in aged care to focus on doing what they do best, and that is delivering high-quality care for older Australians. When aged-care staff are reported to be spending up to a third of their time on paperwork it is obvious there is too much red tape. I am pleased to advise that the government has scrapped the previous government's requirements for providers to follow a prescriptive process in setting prices and the need to document and certify this process in great detail.
        </p>
        <p>
         The previous government's aged-care accommodation pricing guidelines were confusing, cumbersome and prescriptive. I will give you a couple of examples of how complicated these would have been for providers. The first example:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In a group of rooms where some, but not all rooms, have five lights and all of the rooms have more lights, if the number of lights does not affect the method to determine the maximum amount of accommodation payment, then the description of rooms in the group need not mention the number of lights.
        </p>
        <p>
         Got it? Clear? Next example:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In a group of rooms, the floors are covered with different coloured carpets and the carpeted rooms are valued above another group of rooms with vinyl floors, the same maximum amount of accommodation payment will be set for each and every room in the group. The description of the group may state that the rooms having "carpeted floors" and need not specify that the rooms have "red carpet or blue carpet". Alternatively, if the carpets did not affect the method for setting the accommodation payment for the rooms in the group, the provider may choose to omit carpet from the description.
        </p>
        <p>
         It beggars belief that the previous government thought that level of detail would actually provide any protections for consumers or would actually inform consumers. All it would do would be to cause unnecessary administrative burden for providers.

          , I thank the minister for his response and I ask a supplementary question. Apart from the specific examples of the crazy administrative burden that has been placed on these providers, could the minister please provide a broader explanation of the approach the government is taking to relieve the administrative burden on aged-care providers and how it differs from the previous administration's approach?

           The government's focus is on easing the red tape burden of the aged-care sector, as I say, to allow them to do what they do best. The previous government paid little regard to the regulatory impact—

               That detail will be on the My Aged Care website, but what we will ensure is that quality and safety are never compromised. It is unfortunate that Senator Polley in Senate estimates equated red tape with safety and red tape with quality. Red tape does not equal safety; red tape does not equal quality.

                    , that as part of our five-year Healthy Life, Better Ageing Agreement, which we will be negotiating with the sector, we will have as a focus further reduction of red tape in the aged-care sector. We want people who work in aged care, the providers, to focus on what matters and that is providing good-quality care.
