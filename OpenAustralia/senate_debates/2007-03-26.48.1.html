        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Johnston. Will the minister inform the Senate of the progress of counterterrorism operations against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiah" rel="nofollow">
         Jemaah Islamiah
        </a>
        in the region, especially Indonesia? I further ask: will the minister outline the high level of cooperation between our law enforcement agencies and their regional counterparts?

         I thank Senator Ferguson for his question. As Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade he has a longstanding interest in this matter, and I thank him for his contribution in this area. The

         terrorists and commencing criminal proceedings against individuals in that network. To date, over 250 arrests have been made by the Indonesian National Police in their fight against terrorism and terrorism groups inside Indonesia. On Tuesday and Wednesday of last week the Indonesian National Police conducted operations against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiah" rel="nofollow">
          Jemaah Islamiah
         </a>
         suspects in Yogyakarta in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Java" rel="nofollow">
          Central Java
         </a>
         . As a result of these police actions, five suspected JI operatives were arrested, including one who was seriously wounded during the arrest. One person, also a suspected JI operative, was fatally wounded during an exchange of gunfire with the Indonesian National Police officers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Indonesian National Police operation is associated with ongoing investigations into a key JI member,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dujana" rel="nofollow">
          Abu Dujana
         </a>
         . The Australian government congratulates the Indonesian National Police on their efforts against JI. This is the latest in a series of actions they have undertaken against this terrorist cell. JI, of course, is responsible for the Bali bombing in 2002 and other attacks in Indonesia, including the bombing of the Australian Embassy and the

          Marriott Hotel
         </a>
         . I pause to say that Indonesian police are doing an outstanding job in combating this very insidious internal problem in their country. There is a very high level of cooperation between the Indonesian National Police and the very good men and women of our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         on transnational crime generally and, in particular, on counterterrorism activities such as the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation, which was established by the Howard government in February 2004. I should mention that $36.8 million was provided to support the development of that office and for ongoing operations over the next five years to 2009. The centre is intended as a resource for the South-East Asia region in the fight against transnational crime and terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Federal Police has been resourced under a number of initiatives, including the rapid response initiative and the Fighting Terrorism at its Source initiative, to undertake this important work on the ground. A counterterrorism liaison position has been established also in Thailand. An Australian Federal Police officer commenced in that role with the Australian Embassy last month—that is, in February of this year. Assistance given by the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Bomb Data Centre will strengthen regional cooperation and provide a network for the sharing of intelligence relating to the unlawful use of explosives. A Philippines bomb data centre has been established and the establishment of bomb data centres in Malaysia and Thailand is being progressed. Australians and Australia’s national interest in the region remain the target of JI action, but it gives us great confidence that we can work together with our neighbours to bring to justice and to bring down those who would destroy our way of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Federal Police operations with our near neighbours are very successful. We are putting a huge resource into, in particular, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia, as I have mentioned. We have been working closely with the Indonesians with regard to investigations into JI in an effort to identify and arrest key suspects associated with terrorist attacks. I pause once again to compliment the Indonesians. The relationship is as strong as it has ever been. The recent arrests are indicative of the fact that the cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian police is bearing good fruit.
