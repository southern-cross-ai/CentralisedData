        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs. It concerns the new Customs computer system and the independent audit report handed down last Friday. Can the minister confirm that he authorised the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        project to proceed without a fixed budget? Can the minister also confirm that he oversaw the estimated cost of the project escalating from $30 million to over $205 million worth of taxpayers’ funds? When did the minister first become aware of the major problems experienced with this project? What action did he personally take to protect taxpayers’ interests? What responsibility does he, as the relevant portfolio minister, now take for this botched project and the massive cost to taxpayers?

         Senator Ludwig needs to have a close look at the

          Booz Allen Hamilton
         </a>
         report, because what it says is that this new system offers substantial benefits over the system it replaces. In fact, it said that the legacy system it replaced had reached the end of its life and that something new was needed. The report states that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICS" rel="nofollow">
          ICS
         </a>
         is among the better examples of Customs systems available among the developed nations.

        <p>
         I totally reject that this has not been a worthwhile exercise. What we saw was the development of a complex program which we acknowledged throughout would be complex in its changeover. I can say that, in the course of the development of this, we saw the events of 9-11, which threw the scrutiny of it onto security issues. When I was in the United States recently, they expressed great interest in this, because they are going down the same integrated cargo system path. In fact, the United Kingdom is looking at it as well. What the report went on to say is that this provides a foundation which can provide a leading edge for Customs in this country. What Senator Ludwig should take note of is that, from 10 October through to 8 June, we have processed just under seven million messages in the exports area and that for imports we have processed over 13½ million messages. What the report demonstrated was that—

           the exports program went through without a hitch. In relation to air cargo, there were no significant issues. It was in relation to the sea cargo area that we had the issues to address in that changeover—

             and one of the major issues it pointed to was the fact that in the shipping industry you have different terminology and different methods of reporting. Air cargo has one unified language, if you like, in relation to the description of air cargo. That does not apply to sea cargo—

                  As a result of my own initiative, I established a roundtable working group, which met no less than eight times over a period in excess of 18 months, and I dealt closely with industry. There was a decision made to proceed with the cut-over. At that roundtable we had representatives from software developers, shipping, air cargo, customs brokers and freight forwarders—the whole range of industry that interacted with us. It was always acknowledged that this was a complex task. In fact, since Federation, this is the greatest change that the

                   , I ask a supplementary question. Was the minister advised of the problems with the system when he authorised its introduction? Can the minister confirm that, as a result of the decision to implement a half-ready system, the government is now facing compensation claims of up to $9 million? Has the minister approved the payments of any of these compensation claims? And will taxpayers once again be asked to foot the bills for these claims, on top of the $205 million already spent on this bungled project?
