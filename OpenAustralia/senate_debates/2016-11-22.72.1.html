         I thank Senator Carr for his question. As he knows, Australian suppliers are very well represented in Commonwealth procurement, with approximately 94 per cent of Commonwealth contracts being awarded to Australian suppliers in each of the three years from 2012-13 to 2014-15. The Anti-Dumping Commission has a current investigation into the alleged dumping of copy paper exported to Australia from countries that account for the most significant volumes of paper exports to Australia, namely Brazil, China, Indonesia and Thailand. On 29 September the commission found that A4 paper exported from China and Thailand had been dumped. On 4 November it made the same findings for paper from Brazil and Indonesia, and the commission has required securities in respect of interim dumping duties that may become payable. So the laws are being implemented as appropriate.

         Labor's record of high energy costs and industry shutdowns have not been helpful to Australian manufacturers. The federal government will deliver $43 million, for example, to support the Hazelwood power station workers in Victoria's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         following closure of the facility in 2017. These are some of the practical steps that we are taking. Labor made manufacturing businesses in Australia less competitive internationally. It is Labor's responsibility because they put burdens onto those manufacturing businesses by imposing a carbon tax which was pushing the cost of electricity to manufacturing businesses up and up and up—costs that are not faced by our competitors in other parts of the world. Of course, if Labor ever had the chance of getting back into government, they would come back and introduce a carbon tax again; they would again impose burdens on manufacturing businesses in Australia, making it harder for them to compete. This government has a proud record when it comes to supporting Australian manufacturing.

            The Australian government wants Australian businesses to have the best possible opportunity to sell products and services all around the world. We want Australian manufacturing businesses and Australian businesses generally to be able to export Australian products and services.

            procurement rules, as Senator Carr well knows, identify that potential suppliers to government must be treated equitably and cannot be discriminated against due to their size, degree of foreign affiliation or ownership location, or the origin of their goods or services. This is an important principle that our exporting businesses also rely on when supplying goods and services in overseas markets because, importantly, the nondiscriminatory rules contained in our various export agreements ensure that Australian suppliers are not disadvantaged when tendering for government procurement in countries with which we have such agreements in place.

               gone? Where has the Labor Party gone that was promoting Australia as an open trading economy? Where has the party of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating gone which lowered tariffs in order to ensure that the Australian economy could be the most competitive it possibly could be internationally, which made sure that Australian businesses were able to sell high-quality Australian products and services in other parts of the world so consumers here in Australia could benefit from the competitively priced high-quality products that were coming here from other parts of the world? The Australian economy is in its 26th year of continued economic growth, and that is based on the proud reforms of the Hawke, Keating, Howard and subsequently Abbott and Turnbull governments. I know that Senator Carr wants to take Australia backwards into the period when we had a big fence around Australia. That is not the approach of the Turnbull government. We stand for an open, prosperous trading economy.
