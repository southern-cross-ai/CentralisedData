        Today I want to acknowledge the passing of a strong blak matriarch, Aunty Alice. She was a strong woman born on the rabbit-proof fence, and she spent her whole life fighting for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people. I know that I wouldn't be here in this place today without women like her, who've spent their whole lives fighting for First Nations justice.
       </p>
       <p>
        She endured so much hardship, racism and injustice but she tirelessly overcame every obstacle in her way, and I want to take this time to thank her—to thank her for her life's work and thank her for the change that she helped create. We have a long way to go, but without aunties like her we would not be where we are now. She was loved by her family and community right across

        , and I send my love to them as they are conducting their sorry business now.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was honoured to be asked, alongside other incredible First Nations people, to create a video to be played during her sorry business. In that video I shared a poem that I'd written, and I would like to share it with you all today:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Born on the rabbit-proof fence
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        her journey began along the rabbit-proof fence
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        and for 96 years she walked with us
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        witnessing our struggles and our joys—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        a fearless blak matriarch, leading us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Grandma Alice has gone from our arms, but lives on in our songs
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        her footsteps have shaped this land and our hearts
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        we still hear her words of hope and resilience—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        a wise blak matriarch, teaching us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We remember her strength, her smile
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        as she fought for us, so we could thrive
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        beside us through heartbreak, struggles and trials—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        a loving grandma, holding us.
