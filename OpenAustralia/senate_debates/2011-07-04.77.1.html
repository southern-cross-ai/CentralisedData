        My question is to Senator Wong in her own ministerial capacity and also representing the minister for climate change and the minister for industry, as far as it is relevant. Is the minister aware of recent reports that the showroom price of a

        would increase by $1,000 with the introduction of a $25 a tonne carbon tax? Does the minister agree with this estimate by the Australian car companies? If not, what is the estimate of retail cost increases with a carbon tax? I emphasise those two simple questions. Does the minister agree with the estimate? If not, what is her estimate of the increase?

          In answer to the first part of the question: no, I am not aware of that particu­lar modelling. It is unsurprising, however, that there are a range of assertions out there from some parts of industry around the impact of a carbon price. We are aware, for example, of various mining companies, some of whom are coalmining companies and some of whom are—

            As I was saying, there are obviously a great many assertions being made by those opposite about the effect of pricing carbon—which used to be their policy—on industry and on different parts of the economy. I recall, for example, in relation to the mining tax Mr Abbott saying that it would kill the mining boom stone dead. It is interesting to note that, since the government announced the resource tax reforms, we have actually seen an increase in mining employment—

            Yes, an increase. On the one hand we have Mr Abbott saying the sky will fall in and mining will stop, but in fact we have seen an increase.

             , I rise on a point of order relating to direct relevance. There were two questions. The minister answered the first question in the first 10 seconds when she said she did not know. There was a second question: what is the government's own estimate of the cost increases for retail motor vehicles? Nothing she has said since has come anywhere near to that question.

               I would also make the point—and the senator knows this because he has asked me similar questions on carbon pricing over many years—that obviously the effect of a price depends, amongst other things, on the level of that price, and the government has not yet announced what that will be. In relation to the automotive sector, this government has ensured that the new Car Plan will deliver about $5.4 billion to the automotive sector in recognition of the importance of that industry and the need to invest for the future.

                , I ask a further supplementary question. I point out to the minister that these are not allegations by me or the coalition, they are allegations by industry leaders. Holden's chief executive officer, Mike Devereux, has said that a carbon price of between $20 and $30 a tonne would raise the costs of production in Australia by $40 million to $50 million. Minister, what would such increases do the ability of Holden's Australian produced cars to compete with South-

                 One wonders, of course, where the good senator was when former Prime Minister Howard committed to a carbon price through an emissions trading scheme. One wonders whether this senator went to the 2007 election saying, 'I know we've agreed to an emissions trading scheme but I actually don't want one because it's a very bad thing for industry and a very bad thing for jobs.'
                </p>
                <p>
                 One wonders whether this was discussed in the Howard ministry, whether this good senator—who was, I think, a minister at that time—stood up and said, 'I don't think we should do this because this is bad for the economy.' That was the policy of the coalition at the 2007 election and under Prime Minister Howard when they used to actually care about economic policy, when they actually used to care about ensuring there was an economically responsible approach to climate change. We will continue to proceed with this policy because it is the right thing to do.

                      I ask the minister: will the government do anything to support the local manufacturing industry in view of the stated concerns by both Ford and Holden as they 'reassess their commitment' to manufacturing in Australia because of the carbon tax? Is this just another example of Australian jobs going offshore with no impact whatsoever on the reduction of carbon emissions?

                       What is interesting is the senator's interest in the automotive sector when those opposite, on various occasions in various types of costings plans and savings plans, have sought to reduce some of the assistance to the car sector. We have made clear that we will retain the other components of the $5.4 billion new-car plan. That is a very substantial investment in the automotive sector by the government which, in tight fiscal circumstances, has committed to continue because we understand the importance of providing assistance.
