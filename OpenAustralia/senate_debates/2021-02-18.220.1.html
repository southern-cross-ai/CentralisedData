        I rise today to refute a statement made recently in this place by Senator Scarr, who sought to impugn the integrity of a former parliamentarian without any basis. On 3 February, Senator Scarr did not name the former federal member for Fremantle,

             If the senator had been concerned about facts, rather than engaging in a smear campaign, he might have ascertained that the precise incident has indeed been reported in the

              Haaretz

             newspaper in Israel and here in Australia in

             This is not the first time Melissa has been attacked for highlighting human rights abuses experienced by the Palestinian people. Indeed, Senator Scarr quoted a disgraceful column penned by

              Herald
             </i>
             apologised to Melissa for that article and published a response from her titled 'Criticism not same as racism'. Melissa has stated publicly, as anyone who has spent time in the occupied Palestinian territories can attest: 'There is no need to invent atrocities. They are occurring on an almost daily basis.' This was confirmed by respected Israeli human rights

               </a>
               in some of the most difficult places on earth to her time as a parliamentarian, standing up for human rights and for the most vulnerable in our community. Melissa co-founded the UN Parliamentary Group with Queensland Liberal Senator Russell Trood, with whom she became good friends. Melissa was the co-recipient of the

               award for parliamentary integrity in 2013, together with Liberal MP Judy Moylan, with whom Melissa also enjoys a close friendship. Melissa is today an esteemed member of the UN group of eminent experts on Yemen, which is investigating violations of human rights by all parties to the war in Yemen. She and her colleagues recently briefed the

                 Senator Scarr has sadly not made the effort, but I'm confident he would not repeat his defamatory statements outside of the parliament.

                 has asked me to read some final words from her: 'Ultimately, resolution of the Palestine-Israel conflict will require everyone to take a step back and see the larger picture. What is the most desirable outcome here? I'm sure everyone can agree it is not a continuation of fear and hatred, of injustice and fighting, of suffering and loss. It is not a continuation of angry words and accusations of blame and smear. It is rather to agree that these two great peoples can live together in one land, as they have in centuries gone by, in peace and understanding, and in truth and equality. Equality and respect for the rights and dignity of all in one great state, including Palestinians and Israelis alike, without distinction of any kind, must be the basis upon which this longstanding conflict is resolved. That is my hope and the shared hope, I believe, of the many people of goodwill. Thank you in advance for all your efforts to bring this outcome into reality.'
                </p>

                 I conclude by calling upon Senator Scarr to retract his disgraceful words and to make an apology to the Hon. Melissa Parke.
