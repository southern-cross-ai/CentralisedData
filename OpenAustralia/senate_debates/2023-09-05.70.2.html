                               Senator Cash, I don't have to refer to one measure only in this bill that will lift productivity; the entire package is going to lift productivity in the workplace. That's because something that eluded the opposition for the 10 years they were in office was that cooperative workplaces are productive workplaces.

                                   But I'm happy that at last, after 10 years of government, it took returning to opposition for the opposition to actually care about productivity, because their uncooperative, conflict based workplace relations system delivered the lowest decade of productivity growth that we have had in 60 years. That's what your program of workplace relations did: low productivity, low wages. We're turning that around.

                                      In fact, there are provisions within this bill that seek to treat workers who have been mistreated for the past 10 years under the opposition to receive employee-like conditions. I understand that your life's mission is to keep workers' wages low. I understand that your economic policy was to deliberately keep wages low. Australians voted against that, and they kicked you out.

                                      At some point you've got to recognise that the party that had a low-wages policy lost the last election. The people of Australia didn't want your 10 years of low wage growth, low productivity and conflict based workplaces. They voted for cooperative workplaces that were going to lift wages, and we're already doing it. Even in the time we've been in power we've had the strongest jobs growth for the first year of any Australian government. We've created half a million jobs, 85 per cent of them full-time, and wages are growing at their fastest rate for a decade—and we're only getting started.

The last time we did industrial relations reform in this chamber, what did Senator Cash say? She said it was going to take us back to the

                                           Again, it is a point of order in relation to direct relevance. The question was in relation to how much this bill will raise cots on businesses and, in relation to those costs, how much the government expects them to go on to consumers. It was a very specific question.

                                             Let's put all this in context. As a percentage of the total wages budget of Australia, these changes will add one-tenth of one per cent of what wages are in Australia. And, unlike what the opposition are saying, this is not a cost to the economy; this is a cost to the small number of businesses that are underpaying their workers by exploiting the loopholes that the last government left. This money won't be taken out of the economy. It will go into workers' pockets, where it belongs, so that they can actually deal with cost-of-living pressures, pay their bills and get up on their feet. Workers who are currently being underpaid will have more money to spend in their local communities, and we support that.
