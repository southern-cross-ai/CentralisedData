        I rise to highlight just a few of the Tasmanians who were recognised at this year's

        and to illustrate the depth of talent we have in our state by sharing their stories. Unfortunately, I don't have time to acknowledge and share all recipients' stories. However, one was Terese Ann Binns from Longford, who received an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . She has dedicated her life to ensuring the continuation of the Northern Tasmanian Lighthorse Troop service, which commemorates animals such as camels, pigeons, dogs and horses. Another worthy recipient was John Malcolm Crosse, who received an OAM. He's from Brighton and has spent many years of his life in service to his passion of fly-fishing. In 1971 he joined the Tasmanian Fly Tyers Club and was awarded life membership in 2011. In 1989 he joined Fly Fish Australia and pursued fly-fishing as a competitor and captain at a state, national and international level. While Mr Crosse spent his years traversing Tasmania's many world-class waterways in search of elusive fish, Susan Reppion-Brooke was creating an intergenerational symphony with her dedication to youth education. Mrs Reppion-Brooke, from

        , is a shining example of the power of creativity and music for young people. She was awarded an OAM for her work in the often undervalued teaching sector.

        These mostly unsung heroes, who might be well known in their local areas, are now recognised alongside the likes of national local heroes such as comedians

        and the late

        . They are also named alongside more familiar household Tasmanian names, like winemaker and property developer Josef Chromy, who received an AM, and Sheffield based beekeeper Lindsay Bourke, who received an AM and whose leatherwood honey was recently named the best in the world. I say to the 40 Tasmanian recipients recognised in the Kings Birthday Honours List that each one of you has played an invaluable role in your communities and to the social and economic fabric of Tasmania.
