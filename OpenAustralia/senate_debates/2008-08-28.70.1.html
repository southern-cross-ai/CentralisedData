          Mr President

         , on a point of order: leave is not required. When you look at standing order 72(1), you see it states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ... questions may be put ... to other senators relating to any matter connected with the business on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_Paper" rel="nofollow">
          Notice Paper
         </a>
         of which such senators have charge.
        </p>
        <p>
         When you look at page 43 of the
         <i>
          Notice Paper
         </i>
         , you see that there is an inquiry which is extant, and Senator Hurley is chair of the committee which is writing that report. In support of that, I refer to standing order 38(5), which says that the chairman of a committee shall sign such a report and is responsible for that. That reinforces the fact that Senator Hurley indeed has charge of a matter related to business on the
         <i>
          Notice Paper
         </i>
         . So certainly 72(1) allows a question to be put to other senators relating to any matter connected with the business on the
         <i>
          Notice Paper
         </i>
         of which such senators have charge. On the basis of those two arguments, Senator Abetz’s question is in order.

          , on the point of order: it is obviously for you to rule on the standing orders, but in my experience in this chamber when a question of a chair has been sought to occur the courtesies have required that the questioner notify the chair prior to the meeting. If someone is genuinely seeking information, one would provide the normal courtesies. If one has run out of ideas after two questions to ministers, it just looks like a stunt. It looks like a stunt because it is a stunt, Mr President, and I ask you to urge the senator to follow proper process and courtesies.

            , on the point of order: there is no convention, practice or procedure such as Senator Evans refers to. That is a fiction of his imagination. It is perfectly legitimate under standing order 72(1), to which Senator Ellison referred, for a senator, in questions without notice, to refer a question to another senator relating to any matter connected with the business on the
            <i>
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_Paper" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
            </i>
            of which such senator has charge. This is a perfectly proper question. There should be no opposition or angst from the Labor Party. It is perfectly proper for the chairman of the committee to respond to this question and I ask that you rule accordingly.

                    , on the point of order: even those opposite in the government were saying that leave needed to be sought and that was the proper process to adopt. Senator Abetz is now doing that, as Senator Minchin has pointed out, in accordance with standing order 72(2)(a). That is the authority for this course of action. It is now an entirely different process.

                       , on the point of order: clearly the sequence is that Senator Abetz, knowing that if he were to be allowed to proceed should have sought leave, did not do so. He asked the question without seeking leave. You ruled that the question was out of order and it remains out of order. You made your judgement and it was too late then for Senator Abetz to go back and seek leave. Maybe the next questioner should try that option.

                         say that in the first instance Senator Abetz rose to ask a question of the chair of the economics committee. That question was put without notice and I was asked to rule on that point. I ruled that the question was out of order because it was not in compliance with the standing orders. The standing orders as I read them and on the advice of the Clerk provide that ‘unless leave of the Senate is granted for the question to be asked without notice’, and that was not sought in the first instance, ‘it may be asked only on notice’. It was on that basis that I ruled the question out. To those who are putting the case to me that it was sought in the first instance, I do not think that that was put to me; it was subsequently sought by Senator Abetz that leave be granted. I would say that in the first instance the opportunity for the question to be asked was given, the appropriate standing order was applied, and this is a second time at asking the question. I would therefore move on to the next question and that is the question to be asked by the Greens.

                          : I would ask you to have a very, very close look at that ruling because many, many a time honourable senators from all sides seek the call and start talking. When they are then told by the chair, ‘Sorry, you need leave to ask or to proceed down that track,’ the senator is then given the opportunity to seek leave from the Senate. That is the procedure.

                            That is the long, time honoured tradition that I have followed. In the event you are seeking to rule otherwise, when people ask for a personal explanation or something and forget to ask for leave in the first place, they will be sat down and will not be allowed to continue. I personally think that would be a very dangerous precedent not because of the question I am seeking to ask—albeit a very important one—but because of the precedent it will set for every other senator.

                                      , on the point of order: I would put to you that you have denied Senator Abetz the opportunity to ask his question of the chairman of the economics committee as a result of your interpretation of standing orders 72(1) and (2). I would therefore submit to you that it is proper that you now give Senator Abetz the opportunity to ask a question of a minister. That is the proper order of events. You denied him the opportunity to ask his question properly of the chairman of the economics committee. Now it is proper that you give the opposition the opportunity to ask a question according to the standing orders, under your interpretation, of a minister.

                                       On the last point of order, there was no attempt at any time to deny Senator Abetz the right to ask his primary question—at no time. Senator Abetz received the call, stood up and asked his question. That is what Senator Abetz did. I called him as I call everyone. The other thing that I want to address very briefly is that I said that I would take this away and consider it and come back with further comments to the chamber. This is not a precedent for any other part of the operation of this chamber. I completely refute that. This is simply about keeping order in question time.

                                      <p>
                                       Before question time, I am given a copy of the order of questions in question time. The order of questions in question time—and I can read it out for those who would like it read—reasonably distributes questions between the opposition, the government, the minor parties and the Independents in this place. It is still within the province of the opposition, having had that question ruled out of order, to have a member who will receive the call at a later stage in question time ask that question. It can be asked at that stage with a request for leave in the first instance, as it should have been asked—in my view—by Senator Abetz.

                                         Senator Abetz, I am not going to debate it with you. I have ruled on the first issue. I ruled that the question was out of order. The opportunity still remains. The debate that is taking place at this stage, while very interesting, is not helping, I believe, the conduct of the business of this chamber. I will continue to stick with my initial ruling. I am not going to change that. I said that I would take it away and look at the situation, and I will come back with a more detailed response to the chamber. I would advise those in the opposition that if they want to raise that question subsequently in this question time they should do so by leave. I would then have no problem putting that question to the chamber. But I believe that in the first instance Senator Abetz did have the opportunity to raise the issue by leave and chose not to. He chose to go down the path—
