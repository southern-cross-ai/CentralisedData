        I rise tonight in the Australian parliament to condemn in the loudest of terms the military coup that is taking place in Myanmar and to add my voice to the voices of many people in Australia and around the world who are disappointed, frustrated and angry that Myanmar's path to democracy has been so forcibly interrupted by the ruthless actions of the military regime. Tonight I want to assure Burmese people in Myanmar, in Australia and around the world that their protests are not in vain, that here in Australia, especially, we stand united with their aspirations, with the aspirations of all people in Myanmar and with their pursuit of justice, freedom and the restoration of democracy.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia, we have been a strong and consistent champion of democracy in Myanmar, and in these challenging times we remain more committed, not less, more determined, not less, more willing, not less, to championing for Burmese people the rights and freedoms that are enjoyed by so many people around the world: the right to elect your own government, the right to be protected by the rule of law and the right to protest without fear.

        reports that as many as 120 people, including many women and children, have already lost their lives. This brutality demands a resolute response from Australia, from our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        neighbours and, indeed, from the world—a resolute response that can be sustained for as long as it is necessary.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud of the position the Australian government has taken thus far. The decision by Australia to suspend our limited bilateral defence cooperation with Myanmar is important. The decision to redirect Australia's development program to address the humanitarian needs of the poorest and most vulnerable is critical. The decision to prioritise the most pressing humanitarian and emerging needs and to continue to ensure our humanitarian engagement remains with and through non-government organisations and multilateral partners is very, very welcome. And maintaining autonomous sanctions on Myanmar, including a longstanding arms embargo, and targeted sanctions on a number of senior military officers, which have been in place since 2018, is an important feature of Australia's response thus far.
       </p>
       <p>
        But let me be very clear: this must be Australia's first response, not its final response. In this parliament and in this government I will continue to make the case for more targeted responses that don't harm or imperil the Burmese people, but which instead are aimed and targeted at the military, their families and their supporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, in this Australian parliament, I was pleased to present petitions on behalf of many Burmese people in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        —a petition that called for the support and immediate unconditional release of State Councillor Aung San Suu Kyi and the elected representatives and political activists detained by the military; a petition which called for support for reconvening the democratically elected Burmese parliament in accordance with its constitution, and to abide by the rules of law and principles of democracy; a petition which called for recognition, respect and acknowledgement of the result of the 2020 general election; and a petition that urged foreign governments and international organisations, like the United Nations, the United States, China, the European Union, Japan and Singapore, to refuse to recognise the military self-appointed government or to legitimise its representatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now is the moment—the moment to demonstrate our commitment to democracy in the region and our commitment to repel military force and brutality so that we can again nurture and support Myanmar's path to full democracy.
