        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

        </a>
        and

        </a>
        , Senator Wong. Given the minister's detailed knowledge of Labor's carbon tax and her interest in the facts, as quoted to Senator Brandis, can she advise to what extent cyclone intensity and frequency will decrease in Queensland's north by reason of the federal Labor government's carbon tax? How much will droughts decrease in Queensland's west by reason of Labor's carbon tax? How much will coral bleaching change in Queensland's Great Barrier Reef by reason of the carbon tax? How much will flooding change in Queensland's south-east by reason of the carbon tax? How much will sea levels fall on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , because of the carbon tax? How much will dengue fever be reduced in the swamps in the Cape by reason of the carbon tax? How much will temperature change in Queensland—no, the world!—by reason of the carbon tax? For brevity and honesty, is the answer to all of this that the carbon tax will have no effect on them whatsoever?

             If he wants to know how much of an effect there is from policy on the climate, I say to him that if he does not want any domestic action on climate change, why is it that he supports a policy to deal with climate change? That is what Mr Hunt says yours does. If you do not think there is any need to take any action, why are you supporting policy which will be more expensive, which is supposed to achieve the same environmental outcome.

              , I have a point of order on direct relevance. The question was very specific. It was directed to a number of case studies of the alleged effect of the carbon tax on the Queensland environment. It was not about the Labor Party critique of the coalition's policy and you should bring the minister to the question.

                      The proposition that underlies the senator's question is that we should not take any action in Australia because we cannot single-handedly fix climate change. That is true. But the same proposition would apply to the coalition's policy, which costs more. The reality is, we know that the

                      report has found that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is higher than at any other time in human history. There is a lot of science on this, Senator Joyce, and I accept it.

                        The government has released detailed modelling and detailed costings which show that the average impact on the cost of living will be about 0.7 per cent of the

                        </a>
                        impact was on the CPI. This equates to about $9.90 a week on average and, on average, households will receive $10.10 per week in assistance. The government is putting forward a very comprehensive tax package that increases the tax-free threshold, as well as increases to the age pension and the family tax benefit in order to recognise the cost-of-living impact of 0.7 per cent—as I say, far smaller than the cost-of-living impact from the GST. I again remind the senator, if he cares about cost-of-living impact, why is he supporting a policy which will cost Australian households more?

                         , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister explain why, on a question of a tax imposed by her government on Queensland in 71 days' time, she can give no more than a collage of motherhood statements, instead of giving a qualitative answer with facts—that she says in her statement to Senator Brandis are so important—to the questions that are important? On not one issue was she able to table an exact answer or give nothing more than a general motherhood statement.

                            The 10 per cent electricity carbon price impact is in fact what the government modelled and is factored into the 0.7 cost-of-living increase. I thank you for the own goal, Senator, because you have confirmed to us that our modelling is correct. At least one time in this chamber we get a concession, albeit by mistake, from Senator Joyce that the government's modelling is correct. The 10 per cent increase is what we modelled and that is what is factored into the increased payments for households—less tax; a tax break for everyone earning under $80,000, opposed by you; increases to the pension, opposed by you; increases to the family tax benefit, opposed by you—just as Senator Joyce and others oppose tax breaks for small business and for the broader economy. So do not come in here, Senator, and talk to us about cost-of-living pressures given your record and your voting position.
