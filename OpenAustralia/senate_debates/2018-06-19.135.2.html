         I thank Senator Duniam for his question. Senator Duniam, like those of us on this side of the chamber, would know that the Turnbull government's budget continues the coalition's plan for a stronger economy that grows businesses and creates more jobs. It is a fact that, since we were elected in September 2013, in excess of one million new jobs have been created for Australians. That's one million new jobs created for Australians. That's a million more opportunities for aspirational Australian families.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let's, colleagues, now compare this to the Labor Party. Labor's deputy leader,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Plibersek" rel="nofollow">
          Tanya Plibersek
         </a>
         , has today admitted, colleagues, that she doesn't even understand what the word 'aspiration' means. This is what Tanya Plibersek said to Sky News this morning:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Honestly, this 'aspiration' termâ€”it mystifies me.
        </p>
        <p>
         That explains a lot about Labor's job-destroying policies. I believe it was
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
          Paul Keating
         </a>
         who, but a few years ago, said the Labor Party had lost its aspiration. Well, that's because the Labor Party never ever knew what the word actually meant.
        </p>
        <p>
         On this side of the chamber, the term 'aspiration' does not mystify us. In fact, we positively embrace it. It is at the heart of everything we do. Australians, we are known in this country for our aspiration. Why? Because Australians want to get ahead. They want to get a job. They want to provide for their families. And they want to keep more of their own money by not paying as much tax. There's only one side of government that understands that, and that's the Turnbull government.

            Again, our government's budget measures are assisting local businesses, particularly in regional Australia, to expand into global markets. Regional Australians are also known for their aspiration. That is why, as a government, we're investing $20 million in the new Export Hubs program. This is all about helping our small businesses in regional Australia. We want them to expand, we want them to become exporters and, ultimately, we want them to create more jobs for Australians. This is all about giving local businesses the information they need about their competitive strengths in order to enter global supply chains. Again, this is all about a government that understands that, if you put in place the right policy framework and you grow our businesses, they employ more Australians, because they're creating more jobs.

               As colleagues would know, this government is also about creating new industries, and we have announced the creation of Australia's first ever space agency. The global space economy is worth about
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
                US
               </a>
               $345 billion. Australia currently only has 0.8 per cent of that. We want Australians to get more of a share of the global space economy. It's also estimated that between now and 2030 investing in our space industry will create around 20,000 new jobs for Australians. Again, this is the first time an Australian government has given Australian businesses access to the world's biggest space missions and projects. Again, those of us on this side of the chamber know that, when you create new industries and invest in your businesses, they'll create jobs and employ more Australians.
