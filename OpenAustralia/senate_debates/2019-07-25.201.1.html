        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Families and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        (Senator Ruston) to questions without notice asked by Senator Steele-John today in relation to the appointment of Commissioners Ryan and Bennett to the disability abuse royal commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        That was no answer at all. Three questions I posed to the minister: could she understand our frustration, could she see why we felt like we were being made to disclose to our abusers, and would the government listen to the united calls of the disability community—and now the united voice of the Senate—and call on these commissioners to resign? What was the answer? 'Oh, they're very eminent individuals. They have AOs, they have
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSM" rel="nofollow">
         PSM
        </a>
        s.' Well, that is no answer at all. I would remind the chamber that there are many eminent people throughout history. I believe
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Harris" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        is one who could claim the Order of Australia. It goes nowhere near addressing as respectfully as should be done the legitimate concerns of the disability community in relation to this matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that it is difficult for any government to admit they made a mistake. Genuinely, I understand what a difficult thing that is to pull off, but you have made a mistake here and you are putting at risk what would otherwise be one of the only legacies for which I would credit part of this government—that being the royal commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        I ask the chamber: have disabled people not suffered enough? Have we not fought long enough? Can this government not grant us this small moment of justice and victory? I beseech you in the deepest and most heartfelt terms to listen to disabled people, to take on board the message that we are sending to you and to work with us to replace these commissioners.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to speak directly to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Bennett" rel="nofollow">

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
         John Ryan
        </a>
        this afternoon. I know that this must have been a difficult 24 hours and I know that you will be feeling hurt and shock, like you have been treated wrongly, but let me tell you: this isn't about how you feel; this is about our ability to trust this commission. Please do the right thing and resign.
