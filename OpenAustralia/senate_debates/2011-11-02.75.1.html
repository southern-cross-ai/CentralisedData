        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister confirm that the Grains Research and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Development Corporation
        </a>
        is currently without a board because the previous board's term expired on 30 September and, even though the selection process is completed, the minister has not got around to appointing them yet?

           GRDC

          say they are in the dark as to why there is no final appointment of the board, can the minister explain how it is acceptable that one of the biggest rural and regional development corporations, with an annual expenditure of $120 million, can be left without a board of directors because the minister has not got around to signing off on the file?

           The grain industry is important and I think Senator Colbeck recognises that. The grain industry, certainly in this season, is looking to have a reasonable period. But in terms of the representation for the matter, as I have indicated it is a matter that is currently under consideration by government. The board is aware of the circumstances, I have no doubt. They will be advised shortly as to the successful candidates within that industry.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is important to ensure that they do have proper representation within the board. There are a broad number of boards within this portfolioâ€”

             It is a long bow to go from considering board representation within the grains industry to this ridiculous suggestion from the opposition. One would think that if they have serious questions within this portfolio they would go to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a range of serious issues within this portfolio that I am working through, without the cooperation of those opposite. The areas of research and development are all the way throughâ€”and a drought policy. Those opposite are not interested in any policy development. They only want to say 'no' in relation to many of these issues.
            </p>
            <p>
             Looking at this portfolio, I have been in 70 different places across regional Australia, I have been in all the states and territories and I have spoken to hundreds of stakeholders within this portfolio, unlike those opposite who remain capturedâ€”
