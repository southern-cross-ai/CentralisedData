        , my question without notice is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry. Under the previous government, almost 200 Australian textile manufacturers were awarded a total of $45 million through the Building Innovative Capability scheme. Why is the government now abolishing this innovation program, threatening the future of these manufacturers and the 40,000 people they employ?

         I thank Senator Carr for his question. I indicated the other day it has been some four months since the senator has asked me a question and I am pleased for his new-found interest in the portfolio. We were probably still in the middle of the bushfire season. I say to Senator Carr that the government made a number of changes in the industry portfolio as a result of the budget. I would like, for the sake of the chamber, to go through some of those industry programs, to talk about the manufacturing and other workers that Senator Carr—

           The question was slightly broader than that. Also, the minister has started to address the manufacturing aspects of the question and the changes to the budget. I have been listening to the question and to the answer. The minister is only halfway through his allotted time.

            I had hoped that what this government is doing in relation to industry programs might have been of interest to those opposite. In relation to the specific program raised by Senator Carr, I will take that on notice. This government is concerned for workers throughout this nation who, at the moment, are going through a very difficult transition. Indeed, as acknowledged by the Leader of the Opposition in one of his speeches during the week, it is appropriate that we talk about the support this budget is going to provide for—

             , I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister said he would take the reasons for the closure of the program on notice, but I would ask him also to explain why the government's budget announcement said that they were closing this valuable program one year early. It made this announcement without any warning to the industry. I ask again: why is the government pulling the rug out from under Australia's textile manufacturers, many of whom have made investments based on the availability of this grant funding?

              The issue that Senator Carr has is that he was one of a plethora of ministers who were rolled through the industry ministries. Senator Carr has read the budget papers and he knows exactly what is going to be removed, what is going to be retained and what is going to be added, so I do not know why he is bothering to ask the question in this manner.

              I want to go through some of this government's programs which will support Australian workers in the future. There is the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program with $484 million, the Manufacturing Transition Program with $50 million, the Growth Fund of $155 million, the Industry Skills Fund of $476 million, trade support loans of—

Minister, are you aware that half of the previous government's $45 million investment for support of the innovative capacities of textile manufacturers in your home state of Victoria has been abolished? Why is this government rashly abandoning Victorian firms by abolishing a program which used to have bipartisan support?
