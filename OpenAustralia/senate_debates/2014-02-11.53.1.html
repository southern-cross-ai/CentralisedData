        My question is to be Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. I refer the minister to his press conference on 4 February where he said the government 'had all the facts before us' in relation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPC" rel="nofollow">
         SPC
        </a>
        Ardmona. I also refer him to the Prime Minister's false claims, that have since been corrected by SPC, that SPC employees enjoy a range of allowances, loadings and working conditions. Was it these false claims which where the so-called facts that led the government to reject SPC's request for assistance?

         I thank Senator Cameron for that question. Let me just say at the outset that the government stands by all of the claims that the Prime Minister and other ministers have made in relation to these matters. None of the claims were false whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me just make a broader point to the chamber. What was before the government was a request from a business owned by Coca-Cola Amatil, a business with a $9 billion market capitalisation and which made an after-tax profit of more than $200 million in the first six months of this financial year. It asked the Australian government to make a grant in support of a commercial investment, using taxpayers' money for that purpose. We had a company which had the cash to make its own investment decisions, which had the wherewithal to make the investment decisions it thought were necessary in pursuit of its commercial objectives, asking for money from the government which, as a result of the mismanagement of the previous Labor administration, actually does not have the cash. We have inherited a budget from the Labor Party which is in a complete mess. We have inherited $123 billion worth of cumulative deficits.

                . The government did have all of the facts in front of it. In all of the circumstances before us, we decided that it was not appropriate to provide taxpayers' money in support of this commercial investment. It is not the job of the taxpayer to provide gifts to very profitable companies like Coca-Cola Amatil to help them achieve a higher return than they otherwise would. It is not the job of the Australian taxpayer. This government has put a clear line in the sand. The previous government spent money willy-nilly. They did not treat taxpayers' money with respect. This government does it differently.

                    Senator Cameron clearly did not listen to a word of my answer—or he is just reading out the question that was provided to him by the tactics committee without changing his supplementary question? Let me just say it again: we had all of the facts in front of us and we made an informed decision not to provide an ad hoc grant from the taxpayer to a company like Coca-Cola Amatil. We made that decision—

The government made an informed decision that it is not appropriate for the taxpayer to cross-subsidise these sorts of commercial investments by profitable private companies—and the government will not be changing the decision that we made.

                       Senator Cameron is clearly not very agile on his feet, because he clearly does not have the capacity to adjust his pre-drafted supplementary questions as the answers evolve to his previous questions. For his benefit, let me say it again: the government made a very conscious decision that it is not appropriate for the taxpayers to be asked to provide a gift to a profitable company, like Coca-Cola Amatil, for them to make investments in businesses they own. It is a matter for Coca-Cola Amatil to decide what investments they think are appropriate to make in a business like

                       Ardmona. That is a very conscious decision we made.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Just imagine if every business across Australia considering commercial investments ended up having a reasonable expectation that the taxpayers would help them reach their target for the internal rate of return they are seeking. It is not appropriate and it is not the way this government treats taxpayers' money. We will treat taxpayers' money with respect.
