       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) this $4 million underpayment scandal joins Mr George Calombaris' $7 million dollar underpayment scandal and Mr Neil Perry's $10 million dollar underpayment scandal as yet another example of an alarming business model amongst elements of corporate Australia, and

           The government notes that this motion does not acknowledge the vital role played by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Work_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
            Fair Work Ombudsman
           </a>
           as the primary workplace regulator. Given that the ombudsman has either taken or is continuing to take real action in relation to each of the matters mentioned in the motion, including the $7.8 million worth of underpayments of staff of the

           dE Establishment group, this was no doubt an oversight.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government is hopeful that the Labor Party's desire for yet another inquiry into this issue does not prevent them from supporting the government in taking real action in the meantime, such as through our forthcoming legislation to criminalise wage theft.

              agrees that wage theft is happening in Australia, but my concern is about targeting one individual, who has actually sold their house and has paid back the workers. What we need to take into account are those who have also been involved in this: Woolworths, the ABC and 7-Eleven. And one employee from Bunnings contacted us and said that he has been underpaid as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              My concern with this motion here is that it's just focusing on one person. I think that we need to address everyone who has committed wage theft against their workers.
