        Statement from Wendy Craik, Chief Executive of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Murray Darling Basin Commission,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 7 February 2007 the Murray-Darling Basin Commission President, Chief Executive and Executive Team released to partner governments to the Murray-Darling Basin Initiative a document entitled “Comments on the Australian Government National Plan for Water Security”.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This document contains a statement that “the available budget for a new Commission will be decreased by approximately $900 million over 10 years”. I am now aware that this statement is incorrect.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The funding in the Australian Government National Plan for Water Security to cover the activities of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission or its successor is $600 million. This covers:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         $100m for expanded capacity for the Commonwealth to set and administer the Cap; and
        </li>
        <li>
         $500 million to cover costs associated with the ongoing operation of the Commission Office activities (covering all partner government contributions).
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Further, other funds will be available including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the $500 million (plus interest) the Commonwealth invested in the Murray-Darling basin Commission in June 2006;
        </li>
        <li>
         the funds `passed through’ from charges for water service provision totalling around $500 million over 10 years; and
        </li>
        <li>
         ongoing Commonwealth investment in the Commission of around $150 million over 10 years.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Together these represent an increase in the funds currently available to the Commission.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I appreciate that the matter has been clarified and regret the misunderstanding and withdraw the statement quoted above.
