        Like my colleagues, we want to assist the government in getting this non-controversial legislation through in the time allowed. We realise that all of these are important pieces of legislation, and we are keen to help. That, of course, does not mean that we will not make some comments on legislation that is important. The
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4074" rel="nofollow">
         Aviation Transport Security Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009
        </a>
        provides a more flexible and appropriate security regime that will enhance air cargo security without imposing undue and excessive restrictions on industry participants. The air cargo sector plays an important role in Australia’s transport networks. In recent years, security in the sector has been challenged by developments and the industry and governments have met these challenges.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given Australia’s record in air cargo security, we conclude that the security regime established by previous governments has in fact been effective, and we take some pride in that. As the security environment changes, Australia needs to respond. It should be the goal of both governments and the air cargo sector to ensure that the Australian airfreight network remains secure without imposing excessive regulation and costs on industry and the ordinary Australians who depend upon that sector. This legislation before us builds upon the strong foundation left by the coalition. It will enable us to maintain an air cargo security apparatus that enhances Australia’s reputation amongst our major trading partners for robust security. We want to ensure that we continue to have a system that is as effective and efficient as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        My only concern is that we seem to have one of these types of bills through every session. We appreciate that the government is not terribly good at running programs, running the country or, indeed, running its legislative program. That is why we have had to come in and help them today by restricting our speeches. We know from things like the insulation program delivery and what a fiasco that was that the government simply is not capable of governing. Notwithstanding that, it is a pity that transport security amendments—there are several such bills that have been through in recent times and more are being flagged—cannot all be brought together and dealt with so that we can ensure that our aviation security is as effective and safe as it could possibly be. With those very few comments, I indicate that the opposition support the bill and we commend it to the Senate.
