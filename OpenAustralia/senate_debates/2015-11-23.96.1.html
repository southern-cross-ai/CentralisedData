         Senator Waters, I have no trouble at all in defending the approval of the Carmichael coal mine in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         . The pity of it is that you, as a Queensland senator, are not as eager to do so to protect the jobs of people in Central Queensland. Senator Waters, if you visited Central Queensland—as I, for example, last week visited Rockhampton—you would know that the people whom you are supposed to represent in the Senate are desperate for this project to go ahead because, under various estimates, this project will create up to 10,000 while providing to India clean coal which will liberate more than 100 million people from energy poverty, which will provide clean coal to India for coal-fired power stations, which will provide electricity for more than 100 million of the poorest people of that country.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know Senator Waters that you, in your middleclass conceit, would love to engage in the kind of moral posturing which is the trademark of the Greens, but I am afraid we on our side of the chamber are a little more interested in liberating more than 100 million of the poorest people in the world from energy poverty, while providing jobs to Australians and in particular jobs to people in Queensland, more particularly in Central Queensland. Would that you were so concerned about both of those things, but obviously, Senator Waters, you are not.

            Given that the laws of physics dictate that the combustion of coal produces particulate matter, sulphur and carbon dioxide, which fuels global warming, how can the Prime Minister, supposedly a man acquainted with science, being spruiking our coal as a clean energy source in his weekend discussions with China?

             Senator Waters, I am sure it has not escaped your notice that some forms of coal are cleaner than others and the coal that will be mined from the Carmichael mine by Adani is some of the cleanest coal in the world. I do not know, Senator Waters, how it can have escaped your notice that the people who will be supplied with energy as a result of that coal are people who, at the moment in India, are largely meeting their energy needs from biomass and from other much more pollutant materials. So the consequence of the development of the Carmichael mine by Adani, the export of that relatively clean coal to India and its use in a new generation of Indian electricity generation to replace the pollutant biomass upon which those people rely at the moment will be to produce a much cleaner energy outcome.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. Clearly the senator has not heard of solar either. As the co-chair of the Green Climate Fund, will Australia now pull its weight and contribute the $400 million per year over the next four years that would be our fair share to assist developing nations to cut pollution and to adapt to climate change?
