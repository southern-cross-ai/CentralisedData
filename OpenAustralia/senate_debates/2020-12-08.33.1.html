        </a>
        thanks the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for its report on the Bill. The committee published the report on 17 November 2020, and recommended that the Bill be passed. The Government acknowledges the feedback and recommendation provided by the Committee, as well as the dissenting reports published by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report identified that the Cashless Debit Card program is delivering significant benefits for the communities where it currently operates. The program has the objective of reducing the amount of welfare available to be spent on alcohol, gambling and drugs, helping welfare recipients with their budgeting strategies and encouraging socially responsible behaviour.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The program is showing positive results.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Card participants were spending more of their welfare payments on essential items for themselves and their families, such as food, bills, clothes, household goods and fuel. This is confirmed by our card usage data that shows that spending at supermarkets is up almost 35 per cent and spending on household goods is up over 160 per cent. Over the life of the program, over $125 million has been spent at businesses that sell groceries and food, that could not be spent on restricted items like alcohol, drugs and gambling products.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Evaluations of the Cashless Debit Card show the program is working. The first independent evaluation released in late 2017 states that the card has shown 'considerable positive impact' in the initial trial sites, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will provide certainty for welfare recipients currently on the Cashless Debit Card, and see over 25,000 additional welfare recipients in the Northern Territory and Cape York region transition from Income Management to the Cashless Debit Card. Currently, these participants hold a BasicsCard, a card which directs welfare expenditure towards priority needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that the BasicsCard, while effective, can restrict an individual's ability of choice. Currently, the BasicsCard only works in stores that have signed a merchant agreement with Services Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In comparison, the Cashless Debit Card works everywhere except when individuals try to purchase alcohol, gambling products, some gift cards and to withdraw cash. The Cashless Debit Card provides Income Management participants with greater consumer choice and autonomy while reducing red tape for businesses. For example, its provides interest on participants' funds, gives access to new technologies such as contactless payments, provides greater choice where participants can shop and enables participants to know when and how their money is being used just like you and I do every day with our bank cards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has trialled both Income Management, through the BasicsCard, and the Cashless Debit Card in different communities to improve financial management and reduce social harm.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the Government recognises the effectiveness the BasicsCard has had on the communities in which it has operated, it is time to provide Income Management participants in the Northern Territory and Cape York region with the opportunities that the Cashless Debit Card brings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You just have to look at the positive impacts the Cashless Debit Card has had across the current four program areas, from a reduction in drug and alcohol related presentation in the emergency wards and less police call-outs late at night through to a general feeling of improved safety on the streets of these towns.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Business leaders, local Indigenous leaders, elected members, police and from health officials and there is a consistent message—'The card must stay.'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill gives these four communities, and the new regions of the Northern Territory and Cape York, further confidence about the Government's commitment to reducing the devastating effects of alcohol, drugs and gambling in these communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We must continue to support communities that put their hand up and drive positive change and improved outcomes for vulnerable individuals within those communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the Bill.

         (i) not roll out the Cashless Debit Card nationally, and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii) invest in evidence-based policies, job creation and services, rather than ideological policies like the Cashless Debit Card".
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor opposes this bill, and its opposition is not based on ideology—the sort of warped ideology which drives this government. No, our opposition is based on evidence, and the overwhelming evidence is that the cashless welfare card, and income management generally, does not work. Yet, in the face of that evidence, the government remains determined to pursue the cashless debit card because it's determined to punish the poor and the marginalised in society. This is get-back: 'Get back to where you belong.' This is get-back to them. This is not snapback or comeback; it's, 'Get back to where you belong because you have no value and no worth in our society.' That's the message it sends.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is even refusing to release the University of Adelaide report which has examined the card's viability in the Goldfields region in my home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . That report cost $2.5 million, and we're having to consider this bill without being able to be informed about what it says. There can only be one reason for that, and that is that the government is withholding this evaluation report because it doesn't like what it has to say, because it's sure to be further evidence that this cashless debit card is not achieving the policy objectives and outcomes that the government has been touting.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is typical of a government that refuses to have its policies directed by sound evidence, a government that prepares to uphold a discredited ideology so that it can adopt punitive policies—not that everyone on the government side is backing this legislation. Last week the Liberal member for Bass, for example, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There is just not enough evidence that supports the view that this program is a game-changer for these communities and the individuals placed on it to justify the associated harm that it causes.
        </p>
        <p>
         That member dissented from the vote the other day. That's the government's own MP, and she's not alone.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">
          The Liberal
         </a>
         member for Monash said that he too has problems with this bill. How many others in the government's ranks have that same sentiment but haven't got the gumption to stand up for this?
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me remind you how this business of income management began. It was back in 2007, in the dying days of the Howard government. When he was Prime Minister, he had Minister Brough imposing the intervention on the Northern Territory. It was the most egregious example of bad policy in recent history, and with it came the BasicsCard, which quarantined 50 per cent of the wealth or income of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. The BasicsCard was born out of state sponsored racism so the BasicsCard could target only Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Racial Discrimination Act
         </a>
         had to be suspended. The BasicsCard was basically discriminatory, and so is the cashless debit card because it disproportionately impacts First Nations peoples.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me remind you how the cashless debit card came into being. Back in 2013, Prime Minister Tony Abbott commissioned
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Forrest" rel="nofollow">
          Andrew Forrest
         </a>
         to advise on Indigenous employment and training services. The terms of reference for Forrest's inquiry were quite specific, and there was definitely no reference to income management of welfare recipients. Yet Forrest in his report, called
         <i>
          Creating
         </i>
         <i>
          p
         </i>
         <i>
          arity
         </i>
         , took it upon himself to devote a whole chapter on promoting what he called a healthy welfare card. How a billionaire mining magnate can assume expertise in welfare policy and be allowed to write his own agenda is beyond me. That a government can contract out fundamental social policy gives privatisation a whole new dimension and takes it to a dangerous level. Deputising a privileged rich-lister to design a program that limits the rights of people, poor and First Nations people in particular, to manage their own affairs is a perverse way for a government to do business.
        </p>
        <p>
         Back in February, when the Prime Minister announced his new Closing the Gap targets, he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … to rob a person of their right to take responsibility for themselves, to strip them of responsibility and capability to direct their own futures, to make them dependent, is to deny them their liberty, and slowly that person will wither before your eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister went on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We must restore the right to take responsibility, the right to make decisions, the right to step up …
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, the Prime Minister and his government are doing exactly the opposite. The government has now pressed the 'get back' button with this legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where's the principle that is meant to be underwriting the closing the gap agreement between the government and the coalition of First Nations peak organisations, an agreement announced with such fanfare only a few months ago? This bill flies in the face of the flowery rhetoric that followed when the National Agreement on Closing the Gap was signed back in July. The national agreement was meant to signal a turning point in the relationship between Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Island
         </a>
         peoples and the government. It was meant to be based on shared decision-making on policies and programs that impacted the lives of First Nations peoples. In the past, Labor have been prepared to support income management under certain circumstances. But now we're opposing the permanent imposition of the cashless debit card because of the evidence it isn't working and there being no choice for people.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me remind you of the national independent study into the expansion of income management, which was published in February. The study ran over three years and was funded by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Research Council
         </a>
         . The researchers came from three universities: Queensland, Monash and Griffith. The findings are damning. The majority of the survey's participants, 77 per cent of them, reported that they had no trouble at all in managing their money before being placed on income management, and 87 per cent of the participants reported that they did not have a problem with alcohol. Most cardholders felt that income management was forced on them, with minimal assistance and support to help them use it to their advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Here's the real telling outcome of the study. People told the researchers that income management had not only failed to alleviate the challenges, which were largely non-existent anyway, but also caused financial or other problems that did not previously exist. Some of the main problems reported in that survey response were: not having enough cash for essential items—and that was the most frequent complaint—difficulties providing for children and other family members because respondents did not have access to sufficient cash; difficulties participating in the cash economy because of a lack of access to cash means many are unable to purchase second-hand goods, for example; and difficulties paying rent and other bills because of glitches with processing payments, particularly with the cashless debit card.
        </p>
        <p>
         You'd think that with that evidence in hand the government wouldn't consider this intrusive and discriminatory legislation, but they say: 'No, let's crash on. Let's not worry about the impact of the legislation on the most vulnerable of our population. We've a restless support base to appease'—a support base that doggedly wants to punish the poor. That's where this government stands—punish the poor and the disadvantaged. There's no choice for these people.
        </p>
        <p>
         The evidence against income management is even more distressing when you measure the social and emotional impacts. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC" rel="nofollow">
          ARC
         </a>
         study identified from the survey data the strong theme that many of those forced onto income management experienced a significant decline in their mental health and wellbeing as a result of the challenges they faced navigating their lives on the card. Whether the survey interview was conducted at Playford, Shepparton, Ceduna, Bundaberg or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Hervey Bay
         </a>
         , the sense of shame and stigma was a constant point of discussion. Generally findings from the survey indicated that most respondents felt income management had been harmful rather than helpful. To me that is bad public policy, and we on this side are against it.
        </p>
        <p>
         What has this government done to prepare the people of the Northern Territory for the serious changes they'll have to navigate? Late last year I received a delegation of First Nations people from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Central Australia
         </a>
         . They were upset at the lack of consultation about the introduction of the cashless debit card. These people are well aware that the use of the card depends on access to telecommunications and postal services, but in many remote communities in the Northern Territory those fundamental services, which we all take for granted here, are simply not available. No matter how often the government asserts that there has been widespread consultation about the imposition of the cashless debit card, the people who sat down in my office that day and whom I see on the streets of Broome every second day of the week, if not every day of the week, as a consequence of these policies, left my office with a very different story.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 25,000 or so people in the Northern Territory on the BasicsCard—and more than 80 per cent of them are Aboriginal people—are to be moved arbitrarily onto the cashless debit card. There's no choice for these people. Don't anyone be distracted by the government's argument that the cashless debit card is technologically superior and cheaper to manage. Who's benefiting from the card? Certainly not the people who are on it. No matter how sophisticated or user-friendly the technology might be, it is still derived from a policy that is punitive and discriminatory. Try living the life of a person on this card.

          Well might senators laugh. No matter how sophisticated or user-friendly the technology might be, it is still derived from a policy that is punitive and discriminatory. Social policy that is driven by flawed ideology and runs counter to sound evidence is bad policy.

          peoples have been subjected too long to bad policy. They're fed up with government interference in their lives and they're fed up with being branded as irresponsible, lazy and unable to manage their own affairs. This bill disproportionately discriminates against First Nations people and that means that it's racist. In my mind, to support this bill is to support racism. This government goes on and on about how it wants to do things differently 'with' First Nations people and not 'to' First Nations people. That is a hollow mantra. This bill cannot be supported by Labor.
