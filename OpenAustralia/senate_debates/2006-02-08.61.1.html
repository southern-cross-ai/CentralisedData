        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Abetz. My question relates to the 2004 performance monitoring activities of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Wheat Export Authority
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEA" rel="nofollow">
         WEA
        </a>
        , of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        . Is the minister aware that the WEA questioned the AWB in 2004 about the provision of kickbacks in 2004? Is the minister aware that AWB considered the issue of payments to a Jordanian trucking company and the relationship of the wheat price to global benchmarks in its performance-monitoring activities? Is the minister aware that they submitted a confidential performance review to the minister for agriculture? Is the minister aware of the WEA activities? Did the WEA report to the minister about the kickbacks, the trucking company or the extent to which the price exceeded global benchmarks? Did the WEA report this in its confidential performance review?

           I will simplify it for the minister: will the minister confirm whether the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEA" rel="nofollow">
            WEA
           </a>
           reported on its activities to the government in 2004? My supplementary question is: will the minister release the confidential ministerial reports of both the 2004 performance review and the special 2004 wheat marketing review carried out by the WEA?

            Those supplementary matters go beyond that about which Senator O’Brien asked previously. I would imagine that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEA" rel="nofollow">
             WEA
            </a>
            did report to the government, so I would imagine that to be the case. In relation to confidential reports, I would assume that they would remain confidential. But the one point that I would make about this is that for once the Greens have led on policy, because we must remember: if the Greens policy of 1991 had been adopted, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" rel="nofollow">
             Saddam Hussein
            </a>
            regime would not have been in existence and all these wheat deals would not have been able to take place. Poor old Senator Brown: when the West does not invade, he condemns the West for not invading; when they do invade, he condemns them for actually invading.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
             The Greens
            </a>
            are betwixt and between with their policies unless it is anti the coalition of the willing. In relation to the wheat issues, they are being explored by the commissioner and I think we should rely on his advice.
