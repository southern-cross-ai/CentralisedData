               Mr Combet went on to say in his press release, which no doubt Senator Birmingham, being an assiduous senator, has read, that:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               … a final decision on proceeding with advertising would depend on the Multi-Party

               Committee discussions and on an advertising campaign meeting the requirements of the Govern­ment’s Guidelines on Campaign Advertising.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obviously Mr Combet has outlined the position in relation to a final decision which I think goes to your policy point, Senator. I would make the point, Senator Birmingham, in relation to the $12 million campaign, that it compares reasonably well with the $118.7 million spent by the Howard government advertising the

                GST

               , the $121 million spent advertising

                Work Choices
               </a>
               and the $254 million spent on all campaign advertising during its last year in office, 2007. And, of course, how could we forget the mouse pads? So Senator—through you,

                Mr President

               —the government have been transparent and upfront about our intentions and the reasons for that, and we will go through a proper process to ensure that any such campaign meets the requirements of the government's guidelines on campaign advertising.

                , I ask a supplementary question. Having read Minister Combet's press release, I am aware that he also announced a $3 million program to provide grants of up to $250,000 for organisations to engage with the public on the carbon tax. Will the minister rule out any of those grants being provided to any of the organisations funding the current 'Say yes' campaign, which, the government has to date stressed, is not government funded in any way?

Why is it that Australians, who will have to pay more under Labor's carbon tax, are now being made to pay also for Labor's political advertising to sell its carbon tax; and why is it that the minister will not rule out using taxpayers' money to line the pockets of Labor's political mates and allies, like

                          and we have Senator Birmingham now waxing indignant as a member of a party that spent $254 million in its last year in government on public advertising and $121-plus million adver­tising laws which were about ensuring Australians were easier to sack. So do not come in here, Senator Birmingham, lecturing us about public moneys. This is an important public policy issue, an issue which will affect Australians, and people are entitled to understand what this policy is. They certainly are entitled to that in the face of the irresponsible scaremongering that moderates like you, who used to believe in climate change and a price on carbon, ought be ashamed of. The reality is that Australians are entitled to have the record set straight.
