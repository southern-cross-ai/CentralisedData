         First, in relation to the briefings or my knowledge, as the former Senate President Ryan has made clear, a number of senators, including me, were made aware of some details of these events as early as 2020. That knowledge firstly related to the retention of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
          CCTV
         </a>
         footage, as he had outlined in his statement to the Senate in February 2021. He contacted both Senator Cormann and me on 16 October 2020 to address queries regarding the retention of CCTV footage and to advise that we were undertaking an independent inquiry into the actions of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPS" rel="nofollow">
          DPS
         </a>
         staff, following the receipt of anonymous correspondence and its referral to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         . That's what the President told the chamber in 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
         The statement also makes clear that the President 'did not disclose to those senators any allegations of sexual assault'. As you know, Senator Birmingham, after you were appointed as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Leader of the Government in the Senate
         </a>
         and Minister for Finance, you were also briefed on these matters. The former President's statement provided to the Senate Finance and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Administration_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Public Administration Committee
         </a>
         states that the independent inquiry commissioned by those presiding officers reported to the secretary of DPS on 29 October 2020. I was subsequently briefed on this report and provided a copy, as were you, Senator Birmingham, as Leader of the Government in the Senate. At all times I've sought to ensure that this matter was being appropriately handled by relevant authorities, including by raising this matter with both the President and Senator Birmingham. The President's statement on 1 April 2021 makes clear that the report did not contain Ms Higgins's identity. The details I became aware of, through the briefing process I've outlined, were never made public by me or by others. I believe victims have a right to determine what course of action should be taken in relation to sexual assault.

Her account, as given yesterday, is correct. She kept the confidence in relation to the information she was provided with, including with me.

Senator Gallagher told the Senate that she wasn't aware of the full allegations, yet Senator Gallagher refuses to deny advanced receipt of a transcript of the broadcast. Senator Gallagher told the Senate that she did absolutely nothing with the information, yet Senator Gallagher refuses to deny reports she provided suggested questions in response to the information. Minister, isn't it clear that Senator Gallagher has mislead the—

               I reject those assertions contained in that question. I would make the point that Senator Gallagher has provided a statement and answered questions to this Senate, even going to whether or not someone was an old friend. I would make the point also that there are those who did owe the woman in question, Ms Higgins, a duty of care, and those persons still have failed to take responsibility for their action. I—
