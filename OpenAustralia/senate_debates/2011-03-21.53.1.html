        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Arbib. I ask today about alcohol related harm and abuse in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        . Firstly, is it true that there has in fact been a decrease in the incidence of violent crime in Alice Springs since the introduction of alcohol supply reduction measures in 2006? Secondly, what changes have there been in alcohol related hospital admissions since the introduction of those initial alcohol supply reduction measures?

         I thank Senator Siewert for her question on alcohol in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Alice Springs
         </a>
         . As this chamber would be aware, the government is working extremely hard in terms of closing the gap and a great deal of work has been undertaken in reducing the harm from alcohol, which is a significant issue amongst numerous Indigenous communities. The government has been working with the Territory government and is leading work on an alcohol management plan as another key component of the Alice Springs transformation plan. New funding is being allocated by the Australian government to strengthen local alcohol support services for Aboriginal people in key areas of alcohol rehabilitation. This includes an additional $5.4 million to the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress Safe and Sober support service to help address harmful alcohol use. In partnership with the Territory government, the Australian government is also providing $1.5 million to expand

           Northern Territory
          </a>
          remain the highest in the country and leading figures in the world? I understand that the figures slightly increased after 2006 when major retailers in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
           Alice Springs
          </a>
          sought to undermine the measures by introducing and making available cheaper alcoholâ€”sometimes to the point of $2 cleanskins. Did this have an impact on alcohol related harm in Alice Springs, and what action did the government take to address the issue of cheaper alcohol becoming available in Alice Springs and undermining the measures?

            community has been calling for years for a floor price on the price of alcohol and to further restrict the availability of takeawayâ€”in fact, they are suggesting takeaway-free days. Will the federal government back community calls to introduce a floor price on alcohol and implement takeaway-free days, which have been shown to be very effective in controlling the consumption of alcohol?

             In the letter of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, today, one thing that he did raise and admit was that, in terms of the NTER, there had been a lack of consultation between the then federal government and the Territory Indigenous communities. We accept that and we think it is good that the Leader of the Opposition has admitted that, because what the government is doing is working closely with communities. Minister Macklin has visited
