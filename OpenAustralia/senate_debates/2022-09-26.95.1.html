        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. Can the minister guarantee that the Albanese Labor government will put an end to the uncertainty faced by farmers and transport operators and restore the fuel tax credit scheme?

         I think the question was: 'Are you going to restore the fuel tax credit scheme?' I'll have to take that on notice and come back to the chamber.

           National Road Freighters Association President Rod Hannifey says it all comes down to cost of living:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Road transport is at breaking point.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Drivers and operators can't keep footing the bill for rising fuel costs.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Not all can easily pass these costs on and it simply adds to the cost of living across Australia. It's unsustainable and supply chains will soon grind to a halt if this new federal government doesn't step in.
          </p>
          <p>
           When will the minister give industry and the Australian community certainty, given that the fuel excise is due to be reinstated from Thursday this week?

            I will come back to the chamber if there is further information I can provide. Obviously we are going through a range of decisions at the moment through the budget process. I would also point out that the budget is in a terrible state, as I've been trying to make clear in all the public statements I've been making about the budget. Whilst there are a whole range of things and a whole range of stakeholders who would like us to invest more, to spend more and to support them during some of the increases in costs that they are experiencing, we have to balance that with the fact that you guys busted the budget. You doubled the debt before the pandemic. You failed to fund ongoing programs that are ongoing. And we will have to deal with that.

              , ARTIO, NRFA and NatRoad have all written to the Treasurer calling for certainty. Rising operating costs are already impacting the sustainability of road transporters, drivers and operators, who already operate on razor-thin margins. Industry groups and unions are in lock step on this issue. When will this Labor government stop sitting on their hands and restore the fuel tax credit scheme?

               I've already undertaken to come back to the Senate if there is further information that I can provide. The government is currently weighing up a whole range of different requests and challenges facing the budget. We are going through that process now. Whilst there are a whole range of areas where people want us to invest more or respond to a particular challenge, we have to deal with these matters in a fiscally responsible way. That is the government that we are going to be. If there is anything further I can provide, I will come back to the chamber with it.
