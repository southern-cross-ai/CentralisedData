        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Minister Cash. I refer the minister to the Minister for Immigration's announcement today that there will be a freeze on protection visas issued by the government. Can the minister inform the chamber of the legal advice the government has that this motive is not in breach of the Migration Act, which stipulates that once a person is found to be a refugee they must be issued a visa?

         I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her question. I would just like to confirm for the chamber that the announcement that was made by Minister Morrison today was made in relation to the Labor legacy caseload of approximately 33,000 people. The former Labor government, who was in an unholy alliance with the Greens, actually dumped these people into the community on bridging visas and, in some cases, with no work rights. They are the people that Senator Hanson-Young is referring to.
        </p>
        <p>
         We on this side of the table are now clearing up the Labor legacy caseload. We have made it very clear that section 85 of the Migration Act gives the minister the power to cap the number of visas of a specified class that may be granted in a financial year. The minister determined to exercise his powers under section 85 of the Migration Act and that is exactly what he did, as he is entitled to do.

          I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to the fact that she did not answer my question, which was in relation to legal advice that the government has or has not received. How many children will continue to be locked up as a result of the minister's announcement today?

          <p>
           In relation to legal advice, I advise the senator that, consistent with the practice of the former government of which she was a member, ministers do not comment on legal advice.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to the number of children, I am actually surprised that the senator has the gall to come into this chamber and raise the issue of children when over 8,000 children came to Australia on boats under the policies of the former Greens-Labor government. Over 2,000 of those children were placed into detention by Senator Hanson-Young's government partners.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to the deaths at sea—the confirmed 1,100—we do not know how many children actually perished. So, Senator Hanson-Young, in relation to your question—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. When it comes to this government, is there a limit to how much it is prepared to punish a person, including children, because they have arrived by boat after fleeing war and persecution? At what point does the government say that enough is enough?

             The people of Australia made their position very clear in relation to this government's policies on 7 September. I believe that they sent a very clear message to the former government, which included Senator Hanson-Young, that they did not agree with their policies. This government makes no apologies at all for the fact that it has assumed control of Australia's migration program. We make no apologies for that, unlike the former government where you, Senator Hanson-Young, allowed the people smugglers to take control of Australia's migration program. Minister Morrison, the Prime Minister and I have been very clear, just like Mr Howard was. We will determine who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come and we make no apology for that.
