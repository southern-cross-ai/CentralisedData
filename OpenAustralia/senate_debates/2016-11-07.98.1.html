        , my question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. When and how did former Prime Minister Tony Abbott or his office first become aware of the request by Senator Day that his electorate office be established in the building he once had a clear proprietary interest in?

         Senator, you have asked me a question about Mr Abbott and his office. I cannot add anything. I have no knowledge of that, but I cannot add anything to what Senator Ryan explained in the very detailed statement that he gave this morning or to the explanation Senator Cormann gave, although Senator Cormann's statement was confined, I think, to his period as acting

           Given that the lease at 77 Fullerton Road was signed more than two months after Mr Turnbull became Prime Minister, when and how did Prime Minister Turnbull or his office first become aware of the request by Senator Day that his electorate office be established in a building he once had a clear proprietary interest in?

            There are a number of assumptions in your question, Senator, but the matter was covered by Senator Ryan in his statement, when he addressed specifically the question of when these matters were first brought to Mr Turnbull's attention. I have nothing to add to what Senator Ryan had to say.

              Can the minister assure the Senate that the government's agreement to establish Senator Day's electorate office in a building he once had a clear proprietary interest in was not part of a deal for support in the Senate?

The government has been absolutely punctilious and fastidious in ensuring that a complete account of these events has been provided to the Senate by my colleague Senator Ryan and my colleague Senator Cormann.
