         I thank Senator McGrath for his question. We welcome the Thai government's decision to allow Mr al-Araibi to return to Australia. We know that all Australians deeply appreciate the decision allowing him to return to his wife, his family and friends. I want to commend the Thai government's commitment to due process and to human rights, which has led the government to take this decision. We know it was not an easy decision. The issue was not of Thailand's making. The circumstances in relation to this matter have been subject to a review.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also want to thank the Thai immigration and prison officials for facilitating regular access by the Australian embassy to Mr al-Araibi throughout his detention. I'm proud of the extensive efforts of the Australian government, with the support of so many actors in the Australian and international community, in bringing Mr al-Araibi home. I would like to thank the Australian diplomatic network: officials in our embassies in Bangkok and Riyadh, which has representation to Bahrain, and in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT

         Canberra, who have worked behind the scenes for months to secure Mr al-Araibi's release. I also want to acknowledge the members of this chamber and of the other place for their engagement with me on this issue—in this chamber: Senator Wong and Senator Di Natale; and in the other place: Mr Bert van Manen, the member for Forde, with Senator Watt, in their co-convening of the parliamentary football group.
        </p>
        <p>
         This welcome outcome is thanks in large part to the strength and depth of our relationships with both Thailand and Bahrain over decades. The outpouring of support from the

            Senator McGrath reminds us that Australia and Thailand enjoy a long, deep and enduring partnership. Throughout Mr al-Araibi's detention, the Prime Minister and I maintained regular and respectful contact with our Thai counterparts, including during my own visit to Bangkok in early January. We deeply appreciate the way in which Thailand has engaged with Australia throughout Mr al-Araibi's detention, which is reflective of the strength of that partnership.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people of Australia have a great affection for Thailand and the Thai people. Thailand is a close regional partner with whom we cooperate closely on a wide range of issues. Late last year, we announced that we would work with Thailand and other regional partners on a new five-year phase to support the management of the Mekong—a vital, vital river source in that part of the world. Thailand is our ninth-largest trading partner. We'll also be working very closely with Thailand this year in support of its role as chair of

               I do also want to acknowledge the constructive dialogue that we have had with Bahrain in helping to resolve this issue over the past few weeks. I have spoken with my Bahraini counterpart, Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, as has Australia's ambassador in Riyadh, to convey Australia's position on this matter. Australia and Bahrain also share a friendly and longstanding relationship. It's underpinned by trade, by people-to-people links and by shared interests in both defence and regional security.
              </p>
              <p>
               Australia is cooperating with Bahrain on major global and regional security issues, including in the anti-Daesh coalition, and through the presence of Australian military personnel in Bahrain as part of the 33-nation Combined Maritime Forces, which combats terrorism and piracy in the region. I have visited Australian personnel deployed in Bahrain personally. We recognise the important contribution that Bahrain makes to regional security and look forward to continuing to strengthen our partnership.
