         Family First
        </a>
        introduced the Unit Pricing (Easy Comparison of Grocery Prices) Bill 2008 to save families  money by making it mandatory for supermarkets to display a per unit price, such as per kilogram or per litre, on all grocery items sold.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A recent Family First survey uncovered that in one supermarket:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         a Pauls 3 litre milk container was actually more expensive per litre than a Pauls 2 litre milk container
        </li>
        <li>
         a Coles lkg tin of fruit salad was .32% more expensive per kg than the smaller 825g
        </li>
        <li>
         a 600g jar of Vegemite costs 50% more per kilogram than the 150g jar.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The cost of. food a big part of every family’s budget and unit pricing will help Australians save money at the checkout. By making it mandatory for supermarkets to display unit pricing on grocery items it will provide families with fair and transparent pricing so they can get the best value for their dollar. It is often hard to calculate which items are cheapest with different sizing making quick and easy comparison difficult on a busy shopping day. The bill sets out a der\tailed national, unit pricing scheme. An inquiry would allow feedback from families, community groups and industry.

                          I do apologise to the chamber. The amendment was put on my colleague’s desk. We will be opposing the amendment by Senator Ludwig and we will be proposing an amendment that will read that ‘it report not before 25 September 2008’, for the same bill. I just foreshadow that, and I know you have an amendment before the chamber.

                            report would be amended by the opposition to refer the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 to a committee to report at the date that Senator Parry outlined, as I understand it. The government will not oppose the reference to the Senate

                            on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, but we do think that a report at the end of September is unacceptable. We think an earlier reporting date would be preferable, and that is 2 September 2008.

                              say that the opposition did try to sort this out with the minister’s office. We asked for a reporting date of 25 September simply because, although this legislation is not controversial in a party-political sense, it is extremely complex legislation which proposes alterations to the rules of evidence in 11 particular respects. It is my view that, in order to do the scrutiny of the bill justice, it is necessary for that committee, which is already burdened with other weighty inquiries in the near future, to have a little more time.

It is not credible to say that any mischief would be done by the postponement of the operation of the amendments to the Evidence Act by another three weeks in order to give the Senate the opportunity to scrutinise what are very technical amendments, which have attracted not a lot of public comment but a great deal of attention from the bar and the professional associations, who will no doubt want to make submissions to the inquiry and have them considered properly.

                               I just want to say that the Democrats do not have a problem with the proposed longer inquiry. I do not think anyone has actually sought our views or felt a need to liaise with us, given that this is an issue post 1 July, but I would like to acknowledge that we have had some concerns with some of the matters that are contained within that legislation. I think it was initially popped into the non-controversial legislation category and was due to be debated on Thursday of this week. So we are glad to see this referred to committee. Obviously it is much of a muchness now as to whether or not it reports as proposed by the government or indeed by the opposition, but I do not think a few extra weeks would be a particular problem. Having said that, I will not be there to do the debate, but I am actually very glad that we are not going to be dealing with this through a ‘non-controversial’ lunchtime period, because I think that the legislation deserves more analysis, more scrutiny and potentially some debate and amendment.

                                by leave—I will just make a few short comments about this bill in response. The government are clearly of the view that we would prefer to have the bill dealt with in non-controversial legislative time and the bill pass by 1 July. There is no mistake about our position on that. Faced with the position that the opposition do not agree with that and have shifted the date to some time late in September, we took the opportunity of arguing, as we are doing now, that an earlier reporting date would at least make the legislation available earlier.
                               </p>

                                The reason is that the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is, in truth, largely technical in nature. A number of amendments have been made to address developments in case law. The bill also seeks to promote harmonisation in evidence law between Australian jurisdictions. The bill is based on the model evidence bill endorsed by the Standing

                                Considering the nature of the proposed amendments and the consultation processes that were conducted to develop the evidence reforms to this point, the referral, in our view, is not warranted. The consultation included an 18-month review on the operation of the uniform evidence laws regime, conducted by the Australian, Victorian and

                                . The Law Reform Commission found no major structural problems with the evidence acts or with the underlying policy and made recommendations to finetune the evidence acts. Numerous consultations were held in every state and territory, and 130 written submissions were considered.

                                Commonwealth, state and territory jurisdictions worked cooperatively to develop a model evidence bill to implement a majority of the Law Reform Commission recommendations. During the development of the model evidence bill, an expert reference group provided advice on the model bill. New South Wales have already enacted changes to the Evidence Act 1995 based on the SCAG endorsed model evidence bill and are waiting for the Commonwealth bill to be passed before they can commence their act.

                                There may be some comment from the opposition that this bill does not address the implementation of a general confidential relationship of privilege beyond journalists or the provision extending client legal privilege and public interest immunity to pre-trial hearings. Of course, it is appropriate that the government consider these issues relating to privilege as it develops its response to the

                                The extension of the compellability provisions to same-sex couples may attract, as we have seen today, some attention. These issues are in fact better examined in the context of the examination of the second same-sex relationships bill 2008, relating to the removal of same-sex discriminatory references in a variety of Commonwealth laws. I thought it was worthwhile putting that in context for the opposition, particularly the shadow Attorney-General, to help them understand our position. We do not agree to the reference. However, faced with the reality of the numbers in this place, we are trying to seek cooperation to find at least an early reporting date so that we can meet the New South Wales requirements and they can bring their legislation into place. I understand the Senate

                                  meeting on 17 June this week was moved to a different timeslot. We were rushed out of the chamber to a meeting. We considered some 42 pieces of legislation at that meeting. When you are dealing with that much legislation, sometimes the scrutiny of every individual piece of legislation is not what it should be. The particular bill was originally listed in the non-controversial portion of the report but, after examination and reflection after the meeting, we came to the conclusion that it needs to be referred, as we have discussed. I just wanted to set the background as to why it was not dealt with in the Selection of Bills Committee meeting in the first instance.

                                   by leave—This should never have been thought to be a non-controversial piece of legislation merely because, as I said before, it might not be controversial in a party-political sense. It certainly needs detailed scrutiny for the very reasons Senator Ludwig adverted to—that is, it is a highly technical bill. A bill that affects the conduct of criminal and civil trials in relation to a range of important evidentiary rules is of the first importance. Senator Ludwig, who represents the Attorney-General in this chamber, may not be aware that the bill has been heavily criticised in some respects by, for example, the

                                   Bar Association. Given the far-reaching effect upon the liberties of the subject and the conduct of the judicial system of some of the recommendations of the ALRC which are adopted by this legislation, it is the very sort of bill which needs proper scrutiny by this chamber. Nothing that has come from Senator Ludwig has persuaded me that there is any time line or deadline, whether emanating from New South Wales or any other jurisdiction, which necessitates consideration earlier than a reporting date of 25 September.

                                     We have actually gotten out of order. I need to withdraw my amendment, though it was nevertheless important to have this debate to set out our position. I will withdraw my amendment so that Senator Parry can put his amendment. We can then at least set the record straight for the Clerk of the Senate. I am sure he would be pleased if we do that.

                                           I trust that I will not cause someone to seek leave to speak again in this debate. It has almost been a debate by leave. The reality is that this report, which I presented, has been circulated for some time. You will see that in item 3, the Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 is clearly delineated as a bill that is not to be referred to committees. The process of the committee was to go through the bills and ask for a determination that a bill be referred, not be referred or be deferred. So there are three options in that process. There was a very clear decision that this bill not be referred. That does not deal in any way with the rights of any senator to request that a bill not be dealt with in non-controversial legislation time. That is a different question.

                                           I understand that it was communicated to the government that the opposition were happy to have this bill dealt with in that time this Thursday. I see Senator Brandis is shaking his head, but that is the information that I believe had been conveyed to the government. There may have been a breakdown in communication somewhere, but the reality is that the committee’s report is an accurate reflection of the meeting of the committee and that, at no stage during the meeting of the committee, was it suggested in any way that this bill might be referred or deferred. My recollection is that it was determined that it not be referred. Clearly very late in the piece, someone’s attention has been drawn to concerns which may have existed before the meeting but certainly were not drawn to the attention of the meeting. For the purposes of the processing of legislation before the committee, one can accept that from time to time matters slip through unnoticed but, on the other hand, there is a responsibility on all parties to bring to the meeting a position on what they wish to be done with legislation. That is so that, when this report comes before the chamber, we do not get into this sort of situation. That is so that it is an accurate reflection of the parties’ positions in relation to legislation so that the

                                             I appreciate the chamber’s indulgence. I will be very brief. Senator O’Brien is correct. The way the committee report reflects it is accurate. However, I did indicate that the committee time had changed. Due scrutiny of the entire list is a little bit more problematic when the committee time changes at short notice. There were over 40 matters discussed at that committee meeting. To have everyone digest and understand the complexities of each of those pieces of legislation or those bills is difficult in itself. I indicate that the Greens and the Democrats were also present at that meeting and did not raise any issue with that particular bill. The complexity of that particular bill had escaped the notice of all parties. I want to just indicate that, whilst we like to facilitate the processes in the best way we can, we have had a slightly disrupted week for a variety of reasons. That committee was one of those occasions, with a change of time and a large volume of bills to be considered.
