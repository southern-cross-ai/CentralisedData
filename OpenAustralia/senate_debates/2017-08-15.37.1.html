        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care, Senator Nash. According to the Aged Care Act 1997, aged-care providers must maintain an adequate number of appropriate skilled staff to ensure that care needs of care recipients are met. Given the recent media reports of increasing numbers of incidents in aged-care facilities, with many families' members citing understaffing as a huge concern, can the government explain why aged-care homes are not legislated to roster a registered nurse 24 hours a day to ensure better treatment and care for the elderly?

         I thank the senator for the advance notice of her question and note her very genuine interest in this matter. I also note that it's her first question in this place.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Minister for Aged Care's office has provided me with some information, which I am very happy to provide for the benefit of the Senate, but I would also be more than happy to arrange for a follow-up briefing for the senator with the minister. Under the Aged Care Act, approved providers of residential aged care are required by law to meet quality standards to ensure quality care and services are provided to all care recipients. This includes maintaining an adequate number of appropriately skilled staff to ensure that the care needs of care recipients are met.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Aged Care Quality Agency monitors aged-care homes against quality standards and undertakes at least one unannounced site visit per year. This includes interviewing care recipients about their experiences of care and services that they receive. Under these standards, approved providers must ensure there are adequate numbers of appropriately skilled staff to care for recipients' needs. If a provider is not meeting its legislative obligations, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health
         </a>
         may take regulatory action, including imposing sanctions. Anyone who has concerns about matters affecting the care of residents can contact the Commonwealth's Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. There are strict confidentiality and anonymity provisions within aged-care legislation that ensure that people who request confidentiality are protected from having their identity disclosed.

           I thank the minister for her answer. Unlike childcare centres, hospitals and schools, there is no federal legislative requirement for aged-care homes in Australia to have staff-to-resident ratios or skill prerequisites. Given the frailty and vulnerability of the elderly in our aged-care homes, will the government consider following Victoria's Safe Patient Care (Nurse to Patient and Midwife to Patient Ratios) Act to prescribe ratios for registered nurses in all aged-care homes in Australia?

            I do recognise that this is an issue for many people across our communities who are concerned about elderly people. Indeed, as somebody who has had a parent in an aged-care home, I understand how important this issue is. I'm advised that the issue of staff ratios was raised in the Productivity Commission's
            <i>
             Caring for older
            </i>
            <i>
             A
            </i>
            <i>
             ustralians
            </i>
            report and that the commission noted the diversity of stakeholder perspectives on this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the commission expressed the view that at this stage the introduction of a simple staff ratio would not be a positive reform, it did not make any recommendations on staff ratios. The report observed that, at this stage, the imposition of a simple staff ratio is a relatively blunt instrument, particularly given that the care-resident profile of every facility will be ever changing.
           </p>

            Minister Wyatt announced during the May 2017 budget $2 million for an industry-led task force that will look closely at a range of matters, including quality assurance. Details of this task force, including the membership and terms of reference, will be announced in the coming weeks. Again, I can offer the senator a briefing, if it would be appropriate, to be available.
