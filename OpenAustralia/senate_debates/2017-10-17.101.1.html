        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs representing the Minister for Resources and

         Northern Australia

        , Senator Scullion. Can the minister outline how the coalition government is using every lever at its disposal, including our nation's abundant resources, to make sure that it is delivering cheaper, more reliable and more secure energy to regional Australia?

         I thank Senator Williams for the question. Senator Williams, and all of us in the Nationals, are champions for regional Australia because we live in the regions, our families live in the regions and we know the value of regional Australia to our nation. Because we are connected to our communities, we recognise the concern in the communities about rising electricity prices. That's why the government is doing everything it can to make energy more affordable for households and businesses, from helping consumers to shop around for a better electricity deal to stopping electricity companies from gaming the system to fatten their margins.
        </p>
        <p>
         We recognise that Australia is a nation of great resources. We know that the resources industry makes a great contribution to our nation. We know that our resources play a very important role in our energy plan. We, on this side, believe that we should be supporting a level playing field, an agnostic approach, that ensures coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar and batteries are all part of our energy mix.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission pointed out, a clean energy target provides no guarantee of turning around the increase in power prices. The new National Energy Guarantee is a key part of the government's response. It will deliver an affordable and reliable energy system as we transition to the energy system of the future. We will be providing certainty for investors in new and existing power plants to unlock more energy supply. We will be reducing the volatility in energy prices and ending subsidies for renewable energy, which are passed on to all energy consumers. Importantly, our plan will keep the lights on by putting in place a guarantee of reliable power so families and businesses will be ensured the readily available power is in the system at all times. Sadly, those opposite are not supporting an affordable and reliable energy system.

            Our regions will absolutely benefit from having a cheaper and more reliable, more securable energy that the National Energy Guarantee we have announced today will deliver. The nearly eight million Australians and 540,000 businesses that operate in regional Australia can now have confidence we are delivering the energy security and affordability that they deserve. This integrated approach designed by experts that we announced today through the National Energy Guarantee will require retailers to invest directly in new generation capacity that is dispatchable and/or includes lower emissions, enter into contracts with generators specifying the emissions produced by that electricity, and contract with another retailer, as already occurs, that has overachieved its reliability and/or its emissions guarantee. This is an energy policy that backs our regional community and, indeed, communities everywhere.

               The National Energy Guarantee that we have unveiled today is an example of an effective energy policy, one that will reduce the cost-of-living pressures for households, and one that will protect jobs right across regional and rural Australia. The guarantee won't only put downward pressure on energy costs of around $100 to $115 per year to residential bills; it will ensure that we meet our emission targets as well. We know from the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                ACCC
               </a>
               report released yesterday that the renewable subsidies those opposite are calling for will drive up the cost of energy, increase bills for households and put workers out of jobs. Unlike those opposite, we on this side do not believe that putting Australians out of a job is a sensible energy policy. We will always put regional families first and Australian workers first. We make no apology for protecting Australian workers and that is exactly what the coalition's National Energy Guarantee delivers.
