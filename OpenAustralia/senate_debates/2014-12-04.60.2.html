         I thank Senator O'Sullivan for the question and especially for the injunction at the very end of it. The government was elected by the Australian people with a very clear agenda: to build a stronger Australia by building a stronger economy, stronger communities, a cleaner environment and more modern infrastructure. Our commitment was and remains to build a strong, prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of Labor's legacy issues remain unfixed, including 30,000 illegal arrivals by boat. The government's legislation currently before this Senate is crucial to resolving that crisis, in particular, legislation reintroducing temporary protection visas, which will provide stability for genuine refugees while denying people smugglers a permanent visa product to sell to unwitting passengers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has already agreed to a number of measures which will have results, including reducing the number of children in detention. Since coming to government, the number of children in detention has already decreased by about 50 per cent.

          , I rise on a point of order. I seek clarification from you as to whether that question is in line with order 85, which is about anticipatory motions. I am wanting to see whether the question is actually questioning something that is already a notice of motion on the agenda.

              You are not. The minister is answering a question. If he goes into the detail or substance of matters on the notice paper, then it would be out of order. At the moment, he has not done that. He is answering in very general terms, and I will be listening carefully. Minister.

               Once again, you can understand the embarrassment of the Labor Party being reminded of the mess that we need to clean up. Vital work still needs to be done, and we will spare no effort to fix Labor's mess and restore confidence in Australia's borders. The governmentâ€”

Whatever this Senate may eventually agree to, can I simply say: inaction is not an option.

                 Senators would be aware that each and every day we fail to consider vital legislation Australia's national gross debt will continue to rise to $667 billion.

We have a notice already distributed by the Manager of Government Business in relation to debate on a motion to keep the Senate sitting every day, including over the weekend, for particular legislation.

                    Thank you, Senator Wong. So far, the question asked by Senator O'Sullivan was reasonably broad in its context, and the minister has not commenced his answer, so I will be listening carefully to the minister's answer.

                     All senators, including Senator Wong, should take their role very seriously. Access Economics Chris Richardson observes that:

                    <p class="italic">
                     The opposition and minor parties have washed their hands of setting out detailed alternatives, preferring populist posturing.

                    <p>
                     We are not asking senators to necessarily agree with everything the government wants to do. We are only asking that they consider it fairlyâ€”

                       and the sort of noise coming out of Senator Carr indicates fairness is not one of his attributes. We are only asking that they consider it fairly, to treat it on its merits and to be prepared to compromise, where possible, all in the national interest. Each and every one of us has been elected to this place by the Australian people and for the Australian people, and I ask that all senators reflect on this as they decide their actions later today.
