         I thank Senator Hutchins for raising a very serious issue. Firstly, I offer our sympathies and support to the many thousands who have been affected by the massive and widespread destruction that has occurred throughout Australia and particularly Queensland. Small business people and farmers deserve our support, both as fellow Australians and as part of our national economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are well-established procedures and there is well-established assistance available. Indeed my colleague Senator Ludwig touched on the joint state and Commonwealth assistance arrangements under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements in disaster declared local government areas. Under these arrangements, eligible small businesses and primary producers can access recovery grants and concessional loans. For flood-affected small businesses in Queensland, Tasmania and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , the grants can be up to $25,000. In
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , they are up to $15,000. In Queensland, concessional loans of up to $250,000 are available. In Victoria, the loans are up to $200,000 and they are up to $130,000 in New South Wales. In Western Australia, interest rate subsidies for primary producers and small businesses are also available. There are some variations from state to state concerning the levels of assistance and the types of assistance that are made available.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also inform the Senate that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Taxation Office
         </a>
         has itself introduced some support measures to ease the load on small businesses and the farming community while they recover—for example, by deferring the December monthly activity statements by one month, until 21 February, for all Queensland and affected Northern New South Wales and Victorian areas and, as another example, in helping with the management of existing debt by allowing additional time—

           In addition to some of the financial assistance measures that I touched on earlier, there is an extensive government support network ready to assist and I would urge small businesses and farmers in affected areas to call the

            Small Business

           Support Line. It is a team of expertly trained advisers, many of whom have worked in small business, and it is more than willing and able to help small businesses affected by the recent natural disasters. It has already been providing information and referral services in flood areas of Queensland, Victoria and

            New South Wales

           and I would urge anyone who is seeking assistance and advice to contact the support line. The support line advisers’ link is part of a nationwide network of Business Enterprise Centres and other small business advisory services. The support line can be accessed on 1800777275 or email—

             The Australian government’s priority is to rebuild the essential infrastructure that has been destroyed or damaged as a consequence of these massive—the most substantial in Australian history—natural disasters; to assist in the economic recovery and the rebuilding of lives, businesses and communities throughout Australia; and to return to normality as soon as possible. There is a total bill of approximately $5.6 billion. This is a truly massive set of natural disasters. The government’s package to rebuild the regions is the right thing to do and we will be introducing, as has been referred to by my colleague Senator Wong, essential funding initiatives to assist in delivering this $5.6 billion. I also add that, in respect to the tourism industry in Queensland, a $10 million jointly funded special package was announced last week.
