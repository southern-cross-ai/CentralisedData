          I thank the chamber for leave, and I would also like to thank the government for the spirit in which they have approached this amendment, on behalf of myself, Senator Rachel Siewert and advocates for the extraordinary cultural and heritage values of the Burrup rock art province, known on maps, I suppose, as the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dampier_Archipelago" rel="nofollow">
           Dampier Archipelago
          </a>
          and known for a much longer period of time as Murujuga. This is an area that Senator Siewert and I have had quite a long association with. Obviously, it has a vastly longer association with the traditional owners of the area, the north-west Pilbara. There are somewhere between half a million and a million petroglyphs, or rock art engravings, on the Burrup. For senators in this place who may not have given themselves the time to visit, I strongly advocate spending some time on the Burrup.
         </p>
         <p>
          This motion, by agreement with the government, instructs the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Heritage_Council" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Heritage Council
          </a>
          to do an emergency review of the outstanding universal values of the Dampier cultural precinct and threats to those values. The threats are real and present. Woodside recently blasted flat more or less a square kilometre of this extraordinary province for the Pluto petrochemical plant on the Burrup. Woodside have also committed extraordinary cultural violations, in my view, in the original siting of the gas plant, and there is other damage, with ongoing vandalism by people coming and going on the Burrup. This emergency review of the heritage values is extremely welcome. It is long overdue. We hope it will end eventually, after not too long, with this precinct being listed for its
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
           World Heritage
          </a>
          values, which have been acknowledged for a long period of time.
         </p>
         <p>
          I should also mention my friend and colleague Robin Chapple
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLC" rel="nofollow">
           MLC
          </a>
          , who has been a long-time advocate for Murujuga, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrup_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
           Burrup Peninsula
          </a>
          , and of course FARA, the Friends of Australian Rock Art. I ask the minister—if you are able to by leave—to just briefly describe for us what an emergency review actually means in the context of heritage laws in Australia. I look forward to this getting underway as rapidly as possible.

             The government appreciate the senator amending the motion at our request and we acknowledge the goodwill of Senator Ludlam and Senator Siewert. We also recognise the significance of the rock art on the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dampier_Archipelago" rel="nofollow">
              Dampier Archipelago
             </a>
             . The value of the Dampier Archipelago, which includes the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrup_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
              Burrup Peninsula
             </a>
             , is clear and has been acknowledged by its national heritage listing on 3 July 2007. We understand that Indigenous people and groups such as the Friends of Australian Rock Art have expressed concern about threats to the site.
            </p>
            <p>
             While it is not normally the role of the

              Australian Heritage Council
             </a>
             , in this instance the minister will instruct the council to undertake an emergency assessment of the Dampier Archipelago site. The emergency assessment will look at the outstanding universal values of the site and any threats to that site. The council will begin their assessment as soon as possible and are expected to produce a draft report within six months. Once finalised, the council’s report will be made available to the public.
