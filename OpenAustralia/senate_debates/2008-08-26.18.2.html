             On behalf of opposition senators, I warmly congratulate Senator Ferguson on his unopposed election as
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
              Deputy President
             </a>
             . I should note for the record that it reflects well on Senator Ferguson and the stature that he has in this chamber that he was unopposed as both the Liberal nominee for the position of Deputy President and indeed, I am pleased to say, as the chamber nominee for Deputy President. I thank the government for respecting the convention to which we earlier referred that has as its flipside that the opposition nominates the person for the deputy chair. We thank the Labor Party for respecting that convention.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, we are on our side, as I said in June, disappointed that Senator Ferguson was not able to continue in the position of President. He had but 12 months in that high office in which he demonstrated great dignity, impartiality and presence. He has of course been superbly trained for the position of Deputy President, having served as President. Indeed, as I understand it, there are only four senators in the history of this chamber who have served in both positions, and Senator Ferguson creates history today by being the first to go from President to Deputy President! So your name will be in the history books, Senator Ferguson. I have no doubt that across the chamber we all understand and expect that he will serve with great dignity and professionalism in the position of deputy chair.

                  It is a very important and grievous matter that I am discussing here. This is not a â€˜conventionâ€™. There are other words I could use. It is a matter of convenience between the big parties, to the exclusion of the best interests of the Senate and the Australian people, and it ought to be stopped. There ought to be more judicious and sensible thinking coming from the leaders of both the big parties so that, in future, we get a fair and proper and individually based assessment of who will make the best President and

                      . I look forward to sharing in this role. As I said earlier today, I have worked closely with Senator Hogg now for a number of years, both prior to me becoming President and since that time. I will enjoy working with Senator Hogg in the future for the betterment of this chamber, Senator Brown. I think that anyone who is elected to the position of a presiding officer or a deputy presiding officer does have the interests of this chamber at heart. I certainly have, as I hope I displayed when I was President. When we talk about a convention or, as you choose to use the term, a â€˜cosy arrangementâ€™, it represents the strength of the various parties in this chamber.

                        It does represent the strength of the various parties in this chamber. Senator Hogg was elected on a vote based on merit. I certainly voted for Senator Hogg because I thought he was the best man for the job, and I think many people over here did as well. I look forward to working with Senator Hogg. I look forward to working with the members of the Greens party, with Senator Xenophon and with
