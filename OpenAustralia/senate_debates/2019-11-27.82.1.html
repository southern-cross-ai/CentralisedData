         I thank Senator Stoker for the question. The Morrison government is committed to protecting our nation, our people and our sovereignty. Our government takes allegations of foreign interference and espionage seriously, and the allegations raised this week are concerning. As the Director-General of Security has consistently stated, the Australian public faces an unprecedented level of foreign interference, and we are going to deal with it. The government is not naive to the threats that we face. We have been actively strengthening our capacity to protect Australia from foreign interference.

         last year the government appointed the first-ever National Counter Foreign Interference Coordinator to coordinate whole-of-government efforts to respond to acts of foreign interference and administer Australia's Counter Foreign Interference Strategy. In the last parliament we enacted a ban on foreign political donations to ensure that election campaigning that targets Australians is not sponsored by foreign governments, foreign billionaires or foreign companies. We have introduced a number of legislative measures to tighten our laws to make it more difficult for foreign actors to interfere. These include the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security" rel="nofollow">

         Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act, the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act, the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act and the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Act.

        <p>
         The Australian people should have confidence that our nation is better equipped to deal with this issue, thanks to the strong action that the government has taken. The Morrison government will do everything possible to keep the Australian public safe.

            As a government we have taken action to protect Australia and Australia's institutions from foreign interference. Protecting our election processes is vital. To further strengthen our political system against interference, in the lead-up to the last election, we established the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce, a cross-government task force. The task force was led by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Electoral Commission
            </a>
            and the Department of Finance and coordinated closely with Australian security and law enforcement agencies. The Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce agencies did not identify foreign interference that undermined the integrity of the 2019 federal election. We, of course, must be vigilant. We need to ensure that we protect Australians and our institutions from inappropriate foreign interference. The government has taken and is taking action.

               One of the unspoken benefits of managing a strong economy is that it enables us to invest further in our intelligence and security agencies. Because of our strong economic management, over the next four years we're investing approximately $35 million into these agencies to counter foreign interference, including $6.7 million to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
                AFP

                DPP

                DFAT

               . Our strong economic management has also enabled us to put $14.5 million into

                ASIO

               . ASIO's budget for the current financial year is the highest it has ever been. The Australian people can be reassured that the Morrison government is using the benefits of our strong economy to invest in our agencies to keep Australia safe.
