        I move:

       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the document.
       </p>
       <p>
        This gives me the opportunity to talk about a forum that was held in Launceston last week for older Australians, which talked about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        's report on health and ageing and what we are confronted with moving forward as an Australian community with our ageing population, of which we are all very much aware.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to put on record the fact that Minister Butler attended that forum, along with local member, Mr Geoff Lyons. Tonight I want to talk about the overwhelming enthusiasm from the almost 200 people who attended that forum. As we all know, Tasmania is one of the states that has a rapidly ageing community. We have fantastic aged-care facilities and the majority of them are run by not-for-profit organisations. They are facing many challenges in relation to infrastructure and cost. We all know that too many of the tough decisions about aged care were not addressed by the previous government because they did not want to have to make those tough decisions. Once again, the Gillard Labor government will move towards addressing the aged-care issues that need to be addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to touch on some of the issues that were raised by community members. It was a true reflection of those people not only in Launceston but in the surrounding areas who either work in aged care or have family members, like me, who declared an interest in ensuring that we move in the direction that we need to, to ensure that older Australians have the best possible opportunities to stay at home for as long as they can but are given the support that they need to be able to have an engaging and fulfilling life as they continue to age. We have made the transition over the last hundred years to add another 25 years to the age that we can expect to live, which means that people who would normally be looking at retirement at 65 have to plan for their future for a considerable time ahead. They have to make decisions about what they want as their normal life expectancy comes to an end.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will take not only a great deal of money but also a great deal of patience to ensure we get the processes right. In terms of the issues that were raised it is really important that we not only look at keeping people in their homes but also address issues relating to dementia. I am sure that everyone in this chamber and many who are listening know of or have been affected in their own families by dementia. The reality is that because we are living much longer, which is a good thing, we should be instilling good health practices throughout our life to ensure that we give ourselves the best opportunity to have healthy and fulfilling retirement years. We have to make sure that, wherever possible, we give support to the families and individuals in relation to how we treat dementia.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we are talking about older Australians, we have to also remember that there is an increasing number of older women who are now finding themselves homeless. These women have, unfortunately, not had the opportunity to be in the workforce as long as people like me and my generation have, and future generations will have. They are finding themselves without any superannuation, and in some cases where their marriages break down they are left with nothing. Homelessness is affecting older Australians and it has to be addressed. That is part of what we need to do in planning for the future. In that planning we have to ensure that, with the peak we hit with the baby boomers and those of us who are on the tail of the baby boomer generation, we have infrastructure and facilities that can be used for the community and that huge influx of needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to place on the record once again my thanks and appreciation to those members of the community who all came with good intentions to put forward their views on what needs to happen and I also acknowledge the work that this government and the Productivity Commission have undertaken. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
