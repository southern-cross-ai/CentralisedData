         Cabinet Secretary
        </a>
        , Senator Sinodinos, representing the Minister for Trade and Investment. George Kahale is chairman of the world's leading arbitration law firm defending governments being sued under investor state dispute settlement provisions. Mr Kahale has said this week that the supposed safeguards in the investment chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement do not immunise our government and the Australian people from being sued by big corporations using
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISD" rel="nofollow">
         ISD
        </a>
        S. Mr Kahale also said that article 9.15, which supposedly provides safeguards, is negated by the phrase 'unless otherwise consistent with this chapter'. Mr Kahale also said that if the trade minister is saying that Australia is not at risk of being sued for making new or changing existing environmental regulations then the minister is wrong. Senator, do you agree with Mr Kahale's assessment that claims Australia is protected by supposed new safeguards in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>

         I do not agree with the gentleman you have quoted. I have not seen what he has had to say. I have seen other opinions provided by lawyers, in the private sector, who support what the government is saying. I think you will probably find—depending on which barrow is being pushed by which particular group—you will have all sorts of interpretations put upon that chapter. But the interpretation we have taken, based on the best legal advice and the efforts of the trade minister is to ensure that under the investor-state dispute settlement provisions we protect our capacity to legislate in the public interest in sensitive policy areas, which include health, which include the environment. We have carved out our tobacco measures so they cannot be challenged in any way, and there are a number of safeguards around procedure, which will make it easier for groups that may have issues with the way

         S works to be represented in any proceedings as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         People seem to forget that this is a reciprocal arrangement. What will happen is that this provides protection to Australian investors in other countries where their legal systems may not be as advanced or sophisticated as ours. This is, very much, a two-way street.

           I am happy to arrange a briefing for the senator with people from the office of the trade minister and any legal advisers you want who will verify what I am saying, what Mr Robb, the trade and investment minister, is saying, about the safeguards that have been built into these processes. These safeguards are very important, in terms of public policy areas that I mentioned, like health and the environment. There will be no capacity for whether it is the most favoured nation clause or any other clause to cut across our capacity to legislate in that public interest.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let me remind you that it was this Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, and the trade minister, Mr Robb, who stood up to the full force of the

             I may well ask the good senator whether his party will give a guarantee not to use technicalities of the law to stop major job-generating projects in places like Queensland. I find it a bit rich that you seek to attack these provisions and, at the same time, are always telling us and lecturing us about signing up to international conventions, of all sorts, which hobble the capacity of the Australian government to do things that we regard as being in the Australian national interest.
