       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With reference to residential building codes being changed from five to six star minimum standards, and to follow up on figures provided during the 2010-11 Budget Estimates of the Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee in May 2010 (in particular, question no. 68):
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) The answer states, ‘As noted in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS" rel="nofollow">
         RIS
        </a>
        , the cost estimates are conservative and are not “low” or “least cost”. There is significant scope for planners, designers and builders to minimise capital costs by better dwelling orientation, design and material selection’, when are these factors expected to be included in minimum standards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) What is the average dwelling lifetime of concrete, a material that is being used widely in housing, particularly medium to high density constructions, and commercial ‘tilt ups’.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) When will commercial buildings be subject to minimum energy efficiency standards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Why is there currently no national minimum energy efficiency standard for commercial buildings and when is one expected to be put in place.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) How many people within the department are devoted specifically to improving the design and efficiency of commercial buildings.

         has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The rating tools accredited under the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme, which can be used for determining compliance with the energy efficiency provisions of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Code" rel="nofollow">
          Building Code
         </a>
         of Australia (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCA" rel="nofollow">
          BCA
         </a>
         ), take into account dwelling orientation, design and material selection in calculating the star rating.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is up to the building designer to select the mix of building features that will achieve the required star rating for a particular dwelling, taking into account the client requirements and site constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) If undisturbed, concrete can last 200 to 300 years, or even longer. The ultimate strength of concrete depends on the ratio of the materials used to make it (normally aggregate, sand and cement) and the proportion of water used to hydrate the mixture. There is a range of Australian standards which specify the minimum required strength of concrete under different conditions and for different applications.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) and (4) Energy efficiency provisions for commercial buildings were first introduced in the 2005 BCA, and covered class 2, 3 and 4 buildings – these included residential apartments, aged care facilities and boarding facilities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In 2006, energy efficiency requirements were introduced for the remainder of commercial buildings types (classes 5, 6, 7 and 8 – these include typical office buildings, warehouses, laboratories, retail centres, hospitals and schools).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) There are appoximately 25 staff members working specifically on energy efficiency in commercial buildings. There are additional staff members who work partly on issues related to commercial buildings.
