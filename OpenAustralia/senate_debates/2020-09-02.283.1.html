        Every day I am in this place, I'm honoured to represent my beautiful state of Queensland. Nothing gives me greater honour than when I have the opportunity to report to the Senate the great work that Queenslanders are doing to help their fellow Australians in need. I would like to detail to the Senate three remarkable events that occurred recently in my home state of Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, on 18 July 2020, I was honoured to accompany members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Archerfield as they delivered their three millionth litre of water to the Granite Belt Water Relief project in Stanthorpe. Joining members from the Rotary Club of Archerfield were Mr Jitendra Prasad, past district governor, and other members of Rotary Club Brisbane International, members of the Rotary Club of Stanthorpe, and members of the Rotary Club Brisbane Taylor Bridge. All are great Rotarians working together, as they always do, to help people in need, proving, once again, that Rotary connects the world. The logistics involved in delivering this three million litres of water are truly remarkable. I'm sure Senator Sheldon, given his background, would appreciate this. Consider this: 125 trips totalling an aggregate of 54,500 kilometres and involving 1,068 hours. Donations received in cash or kind were over one-quarter of a million dollars.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second remarkable thing about this event is that a leading role was played by one Rotarian, an outstanding Australian: Mr Sultan Mohammed Deen, known as George Deen, a past president of the Archerfield rotary club. George is a long-time operator of prime movers in Brisbane. He knew that his fellow Australians were in need out in Stanthorpe. Perhaps what's so remarkable about this is that George was the one who single-handedly undertook nearly all of those trips out to Stanthorpe. He's the one who put in that incredible effort of 125 trips for 54,500 kilometres and 1,068 hours. So George would do his own work and then he would spend his time actually carting water out to Stanthorpe to help his fellow Australians. He was assisted by many members and supporters of the Rotary Club of Archerfield. His fellow member, Abdul Rahman Deen, known as Ray Deen, also a member of the Archerfield rotary club for more than 30 years, sponsored the registration and insurance of the prime mover and the water trailer. Both George and Ray have been members of Rotary for over 33 years, providing community service to the broader Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third remarkable thing occurred on 8 August 2020. That was that the three brothers—George and Ray Deen, who I've spoken of, and their brother who's known as Happy Deen—collectively celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. All three brothers were married on the same day, 8 August 1970. Sultan Mohammed Deen, known as George, married Kamrun Nisha Yusuf. Abdul Rahman Deen, known as Ray, married Samsum Nisha Fazil and Habib Allah Deen, also known as Happy, married Badrul Nisha Yusuf. The three couples were married on the same day in 1970 at the Holland Park Mosque. Since that day in 1970, these families have made an outstanding contribution to my home state of Queensland. It is a great honour to pay tribute to you in this place.
