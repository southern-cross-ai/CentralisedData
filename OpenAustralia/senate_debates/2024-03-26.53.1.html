        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. In May 2022, the monthly rate of inflation was 6.1 per cent, and last month it was recorded at 3.4 per cent. Since taking office, the Albanese Labor government has had a consistent focus on reducing inflation and providing targeted relief from the cost-of-living pressures faced by Australians. Minister, how have the measures delivered by the government to date helped to provide cost-of-living relief while not feeding inflation? What economic headwinds continue to persist which the government is factoring in ahead of the May budget?

         I thank Senator Polley for the question and for her interest in the upcoming budget. It's an important part of the parliamentary year. The Treasurer has said, and I think those of us on this side understand, that, whilst we're making welcome and encouraging progress against inflation, our fight against it continues and we recognise that people remain under pressure. Quarterly inflation is now around a third of the 2.1 per cent it was when we came to government in May 2022. This is incredibly welcome progress in the time that we've been in government. As you identified in your question, Senator Polley, monthly inflation is much lower now than what we saw at the election. We will have new monthly inflation numbers tomorrow, but the downward direction of these numbers is clear.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ABS also made it clear in the data that they have released that our policies on rents and electricity and our investments in early childhood education have directly reduced inflation by half a percentage point. This goes to the point we've been making about fiscal and monetary policy working together to put downward pressure on inflation. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
          IMF
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         have recognised our inflation-fighting efforts too, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
          RBA
         </a>
         has confirmed that fiscal and monetary policy are working in the same direction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Real wages are now growing for the first time in nearly three years and ahead of the forecast. They were going backwards by 3.4 per cent at the time of the election. This means that Australians are earning more, and from 1 July our tax cuts mean that they will keep more of what they earn too. Of course, we're doing a range of other investments on top of the tax cuts, whether it be energy bill relief, making medicines cheaper, making it easier to see a doctor, cheaper child care, building more social and affordable housing, and fee-free rent.

           Thank you, Minister, for that good news. Labor's tax cuts will roll out from 1 July this year and form the centrepiece of this government's cost-of-living relief package. Why is it so important that Australians keep more of what they earn, and why did the government take the decision to provide support to all taxpayers, not just some?

            I just want to correct the record, because I meant 'fee-free
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
             TAFE

            ' at the end of my previous answer. There are just so many measures that we're doing to alleviate cost-of-living pressures, and rent assistance was another one of those, but I put the two together.
           </p>
           <p>
            The previous government had a policy of keeping wages low. We've taken a different approach, and you saw that during the election campaign, with the Prime Minister leading the way on making sure we were arguing for wage increases for the lowest paid workers. Now, with our tax changes, all Australian taxpayers will get a tax cut because we want all Australians to keep more of what they earn. Labor's tax cuts will be a centrepiece of the May budget, and, of course, we are in a position to provide these tax cuts because of the careful economic management that we have undertaken.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm proud today of the hard work that we've done. I know those opposite hate it, but gross debt is lower than when the Liberals were in charge, real spending growth is lower and inflation is lower. We've delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years and wages are higher.

                 , and I do note that the only way to wake up the opposition is to say something nice about what's happening or something good about the economy. All of a sudden, awake they go. Whoa! I haven't heard a peep out of them, and then, whoa, they're awake! They just can't bear it, can they?

                  There we go! There we go! They are awake, President! We thought they were all asleep, but they really were awake. These are all the issues that we are focusing on in putting the budget together. Our budget will be a budget for the times. It'll have those tax cuts getting to every taxpayer, and we'll look at other sensible investments where it's affordable and we're able to do so.
