        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        and the Minister for Defence Materiel, Senator Ludwig. I refer the minister to the statement of the now foreign minister when, as

        Does the minister believe that 'porous borders', as put by Minister Bob Carr, are allowing illegal weapons to be smuggled into Australia from overseas and, in particular, into

         I support my colleague on this side of the chamber and I do not accept the inference by Senator Cash in her question. The work this government has done in border protection has been extraordinary. Australia has some of the toughest laws covering the importation, possession and use of semi-automatic handguns. The minister is happy to take advice from experts on this. As the minister has always said, he has an open mind when it comes to opportunities to crack down on organised crime. He will take advice from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Crime Commission
         </a>
         and he will even take advice from the opposition if they could add a positive spin.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality is you will not be allow to import or possess of these weapons unless you have a legitimate reason. Our borders are very secure when it comes to this issue. The reality is that police must certify a person as a legitimate user if the person is to be able to import and possess these weapons. Under our existing regulations legitimate users are limited to police or military for official purposes, sporting shooters, security firms and bona fide collectors. Australia has very tough legislation covering the importation, possession and use of firearms. When it comes to the work the Customs minister has done in this area, those opposite would want—

                They have been successful. There have been over 40,000 detections, an increase of 30 per cent over 2009-10. The opposition may be interested, though they have not shown any interest so far, to know that air cargo detections have actually increased by more than 16 per cent from 2008 right through to 2010-11. Customs will continue to employ intelligence based targeting of air cargo. If we look at issues such as rifle magazines—
