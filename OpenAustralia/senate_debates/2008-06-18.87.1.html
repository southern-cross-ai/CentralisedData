       <p>
        I am pleased to table today the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission’s report on the Australian Crime Commission’s annual report for 2006-07. The Australian Crime Commission reports that, in the past financial year, it has delivered efficient criminal intelligence and operational services during a period of substantial growth. Having conducted a thorough inquiry, the committee agrees with the commission’s assessment of its performance, noting in addition the high quality of and compliance with the annual reporting requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, the commission has continued to refine and improve its intelligence and information systems and services, which are well received by clients of the commission. The commission has significantly disrupted and deterred serious organised criminal activity with its conduct of six special intelligence operations, four special investigations and three intelligence operations and task forces in 2006-07. Particular mention must be made of the following, with which the committee was particularly impressed: the significant enhancement of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Database; the production and release of the
        <i>
         Organised crime in Australia
        </i>
        product; the annual launch of the high-quality
        <i>
         Illicit drug data report
        </i>
        ; and the immediate establishment of the National Indigenous Violence and Child Abuse Intelligence Task Force.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ability of the commission to appropriately target the dynamic and changing nature of criminal activities throughout Australia was noted in the committee’s report, as was the dedication of people working for the commission. For the most part, the commission has worked in an effective and professional manner with oversight bodies and other law enforcement agencies. A point of concern for the committee, however, was the occasional lack of communication between it and the commission. The committee believes that, had certain matters been drawn to its attention, the commission could have avoided some considerable embarrassment and the urgent intervention of the parliament late in 2007 in respect of the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Act 2007, currently the subject of an inquiry by the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has identified two matters for attention and has made recommendations accordingly. One matter is the composition of the Australian Crime Commission board and the other matter is the conduct of certain witnesses at Australian Crime Commission examinations. The composition of the Australian Crime Commission board is a continuing matter for the committee. The board currently functions effectively but, given the amount of work requiring financial expertise and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        cooperation, it would be desirable to include the Commissioner of Taxation on the board. The committee heard that some individuals are employing delaying tactics at examinations to frustrate law enforcement efforts. The committee found this concerning and, without examining the issue in detail or drawing any conclusions, recommended that the government expedite its response to the Trowell report. That report, tabled in March of this year, proposed the amendment of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 to provide the commission with the power to certify persons for contempt for not fulfilling their statutory obligations. The committee hopes that its recommendations will enhance the performance of the Australian Crime Commission board and help resolve an operational difficulty for the Australian Crime Commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee thanks Mr Milroy and officers of the Australian Crime Commission, Commissioner Keelty and
