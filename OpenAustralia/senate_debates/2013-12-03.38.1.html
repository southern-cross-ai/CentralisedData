         acknowledge Senator Boyce's important contribution to disability policy in Australia and also all that she has done to engender a cross-party approach to disability in this place. Today, thousands of Australians will come together to celebrate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
          International Day
         </a>
         of People with Disability, with more than 700 local events being held across the nation. This year is a significant milestone for the international day, being the 21st anniversary of its inception. It is occurring in a landmark year, the year that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         has launched in Australia. This day is important and it is a great opportunity to acknowledge the contributions made by Australians with disability. It is also a good time to reflect on the achievements that we have made and the progress that we have made in providing Australians with disability with a better deal. But it is also an opportunity to reflect on the work that we still have to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week, I was delighted to present 12 awards to exceptional individuals and organisations at the National Disability Awardsâ€”people who have made an important contribution to improving the situation of Australians with disability. This year there was a terrific field of more than 200 nominations in nine categories. It was an opportunity to give the winners and the finalists well-deserved recognition for their commitment and contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I have said on a number of occasions recently, it is great that disability issues are no longer at the margins of Australian public policy. This has been no better demonstrated than by the cross-party support for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is important that we recognise that there is more to do, and the National Disability Strategy has an important role to play.

           of People with Disability and the progress that has been made over the last two decades in breaking down barriers for people with disabilities, we also appropriately look to see what more we can do to ensure there is more choice, more independence and more opportunity for Australians with disability. This government is determined to see that Australians with disability get a better deal. This is the rationale at the heart of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and it is why this government is so committed to seeing that important reform through to completion.
          </p>
          <p>
           The National Disability Insurance Scheme is going to make a huge difference to the lives of more than 460,000 Australians, but it cannot do everything. It was not designed to do everything, which is why it is important that we focus on the National Disability Strategy to make sure that all levels of government continue to play their part.

             It is a great privilege to be the minister with responsibility for implementing the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but it is also a great responsibility. Let me state unequivocally again that this government is absolutely committed to implementing in full the National Disability Insurance Scheme. When we were in opposition, we put partisanship aside and supported the referral to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
              Productivity Commission
             </a>
             . We supported the legislation, the announced funding and the launch sites. In the words of the Prime Minister, 'The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
              NDIS
             </a>
             is an idea whose time has come.'
            </p>
            <p>
             We will work to ensure that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is sustainable, not just now and through the launch sites but for the long term. Australians with disability are entitled to have certainty that the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the services it provides are here to stay.
