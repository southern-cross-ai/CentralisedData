        I present an erratum to

        for the period 1 January to 30 June 2006.

        <p>
         I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the erratum.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leave granted.
        </p>
        <p>
         I move:
        </p>
        <p class="moved">
         That the Senate take note of the erratum.
        </p>
        <p>
         I point out to the Senate how unusual it is for such an erratum to be tabled, because we all know that the Department of the Senate so rarely makes mistakes and errors, and when one does occur, however minor, it is appropriate that the attention of the public is drawn to it. This relates to just one page, page 89, of the June edition of the important publication,
         <i>
          Business of the Senate
         </i>
         , which is, of course, closely read by most senators. I know senators are very interested as to why an erratum has had to be tabled today, and I inform the Senate that there has been a transcription error. In relation to the ‘Attendance of senators’ table, the names and attendance in the Senate records of two senators, Senator Brandis and Senator McEwen, have been accidentally omitted.

           Well, it is a transcription error. And as a result of this tabled document I can report to the Senate that Senator Brandis was present for all 22 of the sitting days. He was not absent for any day and he was not absent with leave for any day. And Senator McEwen was present for all 22 sitting days and was not absent for any day, nor absent with leave for any day.

               Well, he attended 14 days out of 22. But you will be pleased to know, Senator Ray, that he was absent with leave for eight out of the 22 days. But I do not want to talk about Senator Campbell. I merely wanted to point out to the Senate that it was Senator McEwen who closely read this document and, by the time she got to page 89, realised that there had been a mistake and her name had been omitted. And how diligent Senator McEwen has been!
              </p>
              <p>
               I found it extraordinary that Senator Brandis had not noted that he had been forgotten. That is the way it is sometimes in politics, but because of Senator McEwen’s diligence she was able to inform the Senate clerks that there had been a transcription error. And I am sure all senators are delighted it has been fixed. And someone should tell Senator Brandis that he too has now had his attendance record in the Senate corrected. I am sure you will find him somewhere, scurrying around the corridors doing whatever he normally does in the place. I am pleased to be able to report his perfect attendance record and the perfect attendance record of Senator McEwen.
