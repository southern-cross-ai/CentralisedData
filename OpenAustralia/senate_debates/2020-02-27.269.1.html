        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Birmingham. No remediation is being carried out on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
         PFAS
        </a>
        contamination plumes, now spreading outside of defence bases in Oakey in Queensland, and Williamtown and Katherine. In 2018, Prime Minister Turnbull formed the interdepartmental committee on PFAS, under the environment department, to coordinate the government's response to PFAS. My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Why is the Department of the Environment and Energy not remediating PFAS contamination zones around these defence bases?

          I thank Senator Roberts for that question. Let me just say that, as a government, we have taken the issue of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
           PFAS
          </a>
          contamination very seriously and we are taking all of the appropriate actions. Obviously, there is a long history to this and I'm quite happy to facilitate a briefing for Senator Roberts. This is a complex issue requiring an effective evidence based nationally consistent response. Government representatives are in regular contact with community members in areas where PFAS contamination has been detected, and the government is supporting PFAS affected communities by conducting extensive site investigations and delivering evidence based remediation solutions, by providing clean water where necessary, as well as information on other ways to reduce exposure, by providing dedicated mental health and counselling services where needed, and by investing in targeted research to better understand the effects of PFAS contamination, including an epidemiological study and the PFAS health research grants program. The government, as you would be aware, has provided $55 million for a drinking water program for communities surrounding

          and

           RAAF
          </a>
          bases Pearce, Tindall and Williamtown, over $60 million in support packages for the Williamtown, Oakey and Katherine communities, including an epidemiological study and associated blood-testing program, and $12.5 million for a national research program into human health effects of prolonged exposure to PFAS, informed by an expert panel established for this purpose. There is much more that we're doing but we are working our way through this in an orderly and methodical fashion.

            Before asking the supplementary question, I just want to say that the people who I have listened to at Oakey have been devastated and they are not being remediated. I will, however, take you up on your offer for a briefing, Minister. Turning to my second question, let me be more specific: the

            at Fern Bay. It is already adjoining Fullerton Cove. What is your department doing to stop PFAS contaminating the Hunter River?
