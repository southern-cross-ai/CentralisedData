        My question is to the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services, Senator Gallagher. Noting that legislation to enact the

        </a>
        Technology Investment Boost measure from the May 2022 budget passed through the other place in November last year and was introduced in this place last December, and given this measure is due to expire in just two weeks, when does the government intend to progress legislation to enact this measure in the budget?

         Thank you, Senator Pocock, for the question. I'm trying to recall the bill that it's in. I think it came but it might not have had the support of this place to get through, as I understand. If that's wrong, I will correct the record. As you know from the discussions we've had from time to time, because we don't have a majority in this chamber we are often dependent on negotiations across the chamber around these things. I'm not sure I can assist any more. I'll see if there's anything further people can advise me of while I keep talking—and looking around anxiously!—but I believe that's the case. If there is something further, I will come back to you on that.

           Thank you, Minister. On the broader issue of having a measure to drive productivity in small business, that is due to expire in two weeks, that hasn't been passed, does the government accept that it is very unlikely that many small businesses will actually be able to utilise this measure?

            No. 4, which is due to come to the Senate next week. If we have the support of the chamber and it passes next week, we will be able to see that commence. There are a whole range of other measures, as you know, that we're working on through Minister Collins to support small business through the budget we have just released as well. We understand our role to support small business and work with them on those areas they want, and we've done that in this budget with some of those investment measures—improving cash flow, reducing compliance costs for small business, the $20,000 instant asset write-off. All those are targeted to small business. The

              Thank you, Minister. Given small business is the backbone of our economy, and there is a technology boost that will hopefully maybe be available for just one week, will the government consider extending the period of time in which this technology boost is available to small businesses?

               We're always working with small business on the best ways to provide support to them. I will defer your question to the Minister for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
                Small Business
               </a>
               . I would also say some of the issues that small business have raised with us are reflected in the budget, around the energy incentive, around the instant asset write-off, around
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
                TAFE
               </a>
               with extra investments in skills for labour, around the entire energy transition—which has huge opportunities for small business—and, indeed, through our cybersecurity wardens program, which was also a priority for small business. I am happy to take that part of your question on notice. We are always prepared to look at ideas to support small business as a big driver across our economy.
