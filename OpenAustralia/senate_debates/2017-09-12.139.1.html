       <p class="italic">
        Foreword
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 17 July 2014, the Senate referred the matter of out-of-home care to the Community Affairs References Committee (the Committee) for inquiry and report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        While state and territory governments have statutory responsibility for child protection and out-of-home care, the safety and wellbeing of all Australian children, including those in out-of-home care, remains a national priority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government works in partnership with state and territory governments and the community sector under the
        <i>
         National Framework for Protecting Australia
        </i>
        <i>
         '
        </i>
        <i>
         s Children 2009-2020
        </i>
        (National Framework) to improve child safety and wellbeing, with a strong emphasis on improving outcomes and providing support for children and young people in care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Framework was endorsed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        ) in 2009 with the objective of improving the wellbeing and safety of Australia's children through joint action by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and non-government organisations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Framework is delivered through a series of three year action plans aimed at achieving a substantial and sustained reduction in child abuse and neglect over time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Framework's Third Action Plan 2015-18 focuses efforts on areas where national leadership and collaboration can make a contribution to resolving specific issues affecting the safety and wellbeing of children and young people. Accordingly, the National Framework and its action plans are not intended to direct action at the tertiary end of the child protection system, or to be an inter-governmental vehicle for progressing agreement in areas of law or policy, or a means to address all issues affecting children and young people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a COAG initiative, the National Framework was initially governed by the Standing Council on Community and Disability Services (SCCDS) consisting of Community and Disability Services Ministers. The governance arrangements for the National Framework were changed following a COAG decision on 13 December 2013 to streamline its Council system from 22 Councils to eight focused on its highest priorities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the cessation of the SCCDS as a COAG Council, the then Prime Minister, the Hon Tony Abbott MP, advised the Chair of the former SCCDS that Commonwealth and state and territory portfolio Ministers could continue to engage on an ad hoc basis on matters of national significance and to progress important policy work. Accordingly, the National Framework is now governed though the Commonwealth, State and Territory Community Services Ministers. Community Services Ministers are supported by:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        This document represents the Commonwealth Government's response to the recommendations of the Inquiry, noting that the response to those recommendations directed at the National Framework have been developed in consultation with the Children and Families Secretaries group and all state and territory governments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There were 39 whole of Committee agreed recommendations in total, and two additional recommendations from Coalition Senators. The response to these recommendations is categorised as follows:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government's response to the recommendations directed at the Third Action Plan recognises the tripartite partnership arrangement of the National Framework focused on a limited number of achievable actions. The Third Action Plan places a strong emphasis on prevention and early intervention and targeting assistance to those communities that have most contact with the child protection system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For those recommendations directed at COAG, the Commonwealth Government's response reflects the support role of the Children and Families Secretaries group to Commonwealth, state and territory ministers. This joint commitment does not change the fundamental responsibilities of the different levels of government. The Commonwealth Government will bring the Report to the attention of state and territory governments through the Children and Families Secretaries group.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government response to the recommendations calling for a national approach to out-of-home care with regards to adoption and permanency acknowledges the recent jurisdictional reforms to provide improved certainty, stability and timeliness of permanent placements for children in out-of-home care. The Commonwealth is working with jurisdictions to continue these improvements, and supports national collaboration on this important issue to ensure that all children across Australia have access to a safe, secure and stable environment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendations directed at COAG regarding the National Framework and its Third Action Plan
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government notes the above recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Framework is a structure to guide collaboration among Commonwealth Government jurisdictions and the non-government sector on activities designed to keep Australia's children and young people safe and well. Through a tripartite partnership arrangement involving the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and the non-government services sector, it identifies and progresses areas of common interest, where there is consensus among parties that action is required and as to the appropriate way forward.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Work under the National Framework is guided by three-year action plans, which are necessarily focused on a limited number of achievable actions in areas ripe for reform. It recognises that children and young people are supported by a number of interlocking systems, including health, education and justice. However, it focuses efforts on areas where national leadership can make a contribution to specific issues affecting the safety of children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Framework is not:

       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Third Action Plan was developed under the tripartite agreement, with all parties represented on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Forum" rel="nofollow">
         National Forum
        </a>
        . The non-government sector is represented by the Coalition of Organisations Committed to the Safety and Wellbeing of Australia's Children (the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
         NGO
        </a>
        Coalition) which consists of over 160 non-government organisations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Forum held a series of consultations with stakeholders on the development of the Third Action Plan 2015-2018 between March and June 2015. Seventeen consultations were held across the country, including a session with Aboriginal and

         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        people and representatives from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, as well as sessions with children and young people. Additional consultations were held with people and families living with disability and representatives from the culturally and linguistically diverse community. The consultations were attended by over 300 participants and included representatives from peak organisations, service providers, researchers, children and young people. The

        ) also received 27 written submissions in response to its discussion paper. The feedback from consultations and written submissions formed the basis of the Third Action Plan which was developed and agreed through the National Forum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The development of the Third Action Plan took into account the findings of the Senate Community Affairs Reference Committee Inquiry into Out-of-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Care" rel="nofollow">
         Home Care
        </a>
        (the Report). It was recognised that whilst many of the recommendations in the Report are for action of state and territory governments as they have statutory responsibility for child protection, many of the recommendations are supported by activities more broadly within the National Framework. This includes a commitment under the Third Action Plan to examine how to continue the full implementation of the existing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Standards" rel="nofollow">
         National Standards
        </a>
        for Out-of-Home Care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Third Action Plan was released on 9 December 2015 by the Minister for Social Services, the Hon Christian Porter MP, following endorsement by state and territory ministers. The focus of the Third Action Plan is to identify and implement early intervention and prevention strategies that require joint action by Commonwealth, state and territory governments and the community sector. The Third Action Plan focuses on three strategies:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Strategy 1: Early intervention with a focus on the early years, particularly the first 1000 days for a child.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Strategy 2: Helping young people in out-of-home care to thrive in adulthood.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Strategy 3: Organisations responding better to children and young people to keep them safe.

        <i>
         Strategies
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The three overarching strategies and two cross-cutting focus areas that form the basis of the Third Action Plan have been endorsed by all stakeholders as having national significance and requiring prioritised effort to improve the wellbeing of children and young people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Actions under Strategy 1:
        <i>
         Early intervention with a focus on the early years, particularly the first 1000 days for a child,
        </i>
        has a particular focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people, and families dealing with multiple issues including mental health issues, alcohol and other drug misuse, or family and domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2016-17 Budget, the Commonwealth Government allocated $1.23 million over four years to the implementation of the
        <i>
         Building Capacity in Australian Parents
        </i>
        trial. The
        <i>
         Building Capacity in Australian Parents
        </i>
        trial will work to build parenting skills in the first 1,000 days of a child's life. It will focus on vulnerable families where parents have mental health issues, are in jail, or face significant disadvantage. Under the trial, a local area coordinator will improve the coordination of support services for parents and train service staff to help new parents become more effective in their parenting role.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Third Action Plan will bring a renewed focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, families and communities aimed at reducing the overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people needing child protection services. All parties to the National Framework recognise the importance of ensuring that children and young people in out-of-home care remain connected with their family, community and culture. Under the Third Action Plan all jurisdictions committed to continuing to fully implement the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A new commitment under the Third Action Plan is agreement to adopt a broader definition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle. The intention is to ensure that the five domains of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle (prevention, partnership, placement, participation and connection) are applied to the implementation of all strategies and actions identified in the Third Action Plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Third Action Plan Strategy 2:
        <i>
         Helping young people in out-of-home care to thrive into adulthood
        </i>
        is of relevance to the issues raised in the Report. This strategy recognises that research consistently points to the poor social and economic outcomes for many young people in out-of-home care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This strategy seeks to provide intensive support and priority access to key services, including housing, to assist these young people transition well into adulthood. It will explore data sharing links between Commonwealth and state and territory governments to inform policy development, better tailor services and drive innovation in service delivery for young people leaving care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2016-17 Budget, $3.87 million was provided to fund the
        <i>
         Towards Independent Adulthood
        </i>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIA" rel="nofollow">
         TIA
        </a>
        ) Trial to be delivered under Strategy 2 of the Third Action Plan of the National Framework. The aim of the trial is to increase the wellbeing and future economic and social outcomes of young people transitioning out of care and reduce the likelihood of their reliance on welfare later in life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial" rel="nofollow">
         The Trial
        </a>
        will deliver intensive mentoring and targeted supports over three years to up to 80 young people aged 16 years, as they transition from formal care to adulthood.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The TIA Trial is due to commence in mid-2017 and conclude mid-2020. The Trial will be independently evaluated, with the findings to be available to state and territory governments to guide future interventions for young people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Strategy 2 also includes examining 2014 reforms to the
        <i>
         Transition to Independent Living Allowance
        </i>
        (TILA) to ensure that it reaches to those who need it most.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_April" rel="nofollow">
         In April
        </a>
        2016, DSS published its 2015,
        <i>
         Review of the Transition to Independent Living Allowance.
        </i>
        DSS implemented the majority of the recommendations of the review including improving communications, simplifying administration and driving demand for TILA. DSS streamlined administration by removing the first step of the two-step application. Case workers have been able to make one TILA application directly to the Unified Government Gateway (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGG" rel="nofollow">
         UGG
        </a>
        ) where previously caseworkers first applied to the DSS TILA Office for approval. This has reduced red-tape and has increased the speed of payment to recipients by a minimum of one to three business days. DSS implemented a communication plan by producing guides for caseworkers and young people on how to apply for TILA and providing accurate web content for state and territory departments and non-government organisations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The work under Strategy 2 also includes an evaluation of policies and legislation in each jurisdiction that relate to transitioning young people from 00HC into adulthood with a view to identify a possible national approach to extend supports for young people in OOHC beyond the age of 18 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The actions under Strategy 2 include working closely with young people, encouraging participation in decision-making processes and ensuring their needs are met. By extending access to services, the Commonwealth seeks to improve health, education, employment and housing outcomes for young people transitioning from care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Strategy 3:
        <i>
         Organisations responding better to children and young people to keep them safe
        </i>
        will provide a more comprehensive and cohesive national approach to strengthening the capacity of organisations and systems to increase child safety and facilitate information exchange between services. Cultural awareness will be an important component of all child safe organisation approaches under the Third Action Plan to ensure activities respect diversity in cultures and child rearing practices and help to foster cultural competency within the organisations. It will reduce the risk of a child being harmed and foster environments that empower children and young people to speak up, and recognise and appropriately respond to threats to children. This strategy will also consider the recommendations of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Institutional Responses to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Sexual_Abuse" rel="nofollow">
         Child Sexual Abuse
        </a>
        (the Royal Commission) and actions to support these findings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Actions under Strategy 3 include the review of the 2005 National Framework for Creating Safe Environments for Children-Organisations, Employees and Volunteers (2005 Child Safe Framework) to take into account the work of the Royal Commission and current child safe standards, reforms and resources across government and non-government organisations. On 11 November 2016, Community Services Ministers from all jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth, agreed to the development of a National Statement of Principles for Child Safe Organisations (the National Statement of Principles), to be endorsed by COAG. This Strategy 3 work will now be part of work on the National Statement of Principles.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Drawing from the Royal Commission, the National Statement of Principles will drive implementation of a child safe culture across all sectors to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children and young people across Australia and be used to support cross-sectoral jurisdictional child safety policy making, funding and investment decisions and legislation and compliance regimes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the extent and scope of work, Community Services Ministers agreed to a phased approach for the development of the National Statement of Principles over an 18 month period for COAG endorsement in mid-2018. This work will be further supported through a national cross-sector engagement process, development of child safe organisation resources and a communication strategy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further actions under Strategy 3 include examination of the effectiveness of existing practices and identification of barriers and opportunities to improve information exchange between government and non-government organisations and other key stakeholders to support child safety and wellbeing.

        The Commonwealth Government currently works with state and territory governments through the Department of Immigration and Border Protection's UHM Program to support UHMs and their families to this end.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The UHM Program facilitates the provision of relevant care, accommodation, supervision and support services to certain unaccompanied minors who have been granted a visa under Australia's offshore Humanitarian Program, or granted a Protection Visa in Australia. The UHM Program has been providing support to unaccompanied refugee children in Australia for over 40 years and, while numbers fluctuate, the Program is currently delivering care and support services to over 200 unaccompanied refugee children, as young as five years old.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The UHM Program is based on principles similar to out-of-home care, utilising the experience of State/Territory Government Child Welfare Authorities (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCWA" rel="nofollow">
         SCWA

        ).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        UHMs supported by SCWAs most commonly live in the community with either an adult relative, an assessed and approved unrelated adult caregiver, or an adult caregiver who has customarily adopted the child in their country of origin.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_people" rel="nofollow">
         Young people

        of an appropriate age, maturity and independence are also supported in independent living. Further, a small number are placed with caregivers who are specifically recruited, assessed and approved by the state for the purpose of caring for UHMs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the context of contracted services, the UHM Program delivers the following services:

       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Where a UHM's care arrangement irretrievably breaks down, through its partnerships with SCWAs, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection can facilitate a small number of placements in out-of-home care arrangements. These may include placement with an approved family or state-accredited foster family. if it is in the minor's best interests, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will support the UHM's care and welfare through a residential care placement with a Department of Immigration and Border Protection-contracted service provider.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Also, in the case of UHMs who are strictly unaccompanied, where it is in their best interests the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will work with child welfare authorities and relevant NGOs and community groups to look for alternative long-term placement options for the minor, including foster care, adoption or a family law order.

          That the Senate take note of the document.
         </p>
         <p>
          I made the reference to the community affairs committee, which I also chaired. I introduced the motion to refer this matter because we have a very poor situation with out-of-home care in Australia. In fact, one of the key issues that we looked at in this inquiry was the poor life outcomes of people leaving out-of-home care. Unfortunately, we haven't made much progress in that respect. One of the other key areas that we looked at, besides looking in general across the board at out-of-home care, was the fact that there's such a high number of Aboriginal children going into out-of-home care. In fact, the latest report from SNAICC, the national voice for Aboriginal children, shows that about ten times more Aboriginal children are going into out-of-home care than non-Aboriginal children. That figure is appallingly high and compares unfavourably with the number of children that were going into out-of-home care when the children were being taken when the stolen generations were occurring. The report also points out that a number of recommendations from the
          <i>
           Bringing them home
          </i>
          report from 20 years ago this year have not been implemented. I will come back to that issue shortly.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'm glad the government finally has responded to the community affairs committee report. I'm pleased with some of the response, but most, unfortunately, I'm not, because they're simply not being proactive enough in dealing with this issue of out-of-home care. The government disagrees with our recommendation to provide a separate Medicare item for children in out-of-home care to improve their access to health assessments and treatments. The government say they disagreed with that because they're concerned that it would be ad hoc. In their response, they largely dealt with the health assessment side of it rather than the treatment side and said that there are case managers and that would be better. That simply does not work, because the states don't have case managers to the degree to which this comment by the government implies. With the extraordinarily high number of children going into out-of-home care, they simply aren't getting individual attention. This was recommended by organisations and also, importantly, foster carers, who are looking after these children and who have problems accessing health services. In particular, this doesn't just talk about health assessments; it talks about treatments, including mental health treatments. I'm extremely disappointed that the government has squibbed on this and disagrees with it.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government notes a number of our recommendations, particularly those around the Third Action Plan of the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children 2009â€“2020. The government puts a lot of emphasis on the Third Action Plan, and I wish I had as much confidence as it does that it'll be implemented. The Third Action Plan runs out in 2018, so it has not got that long to go. When we were carrying out this inquiry, we found many of the approaches that were recommended in the Second Action Plan hadn't been carried out. I think the government needs to be more proactive. One of the issues they note, for example, is increasing the allowance for young people transitioning out of care. I do acknowledge they've increased it slightly since we had the inquiry, but it needs to be increased more. One of the huge issues that came up is young people receiving post-care support to 21 years of age. At the moment, young people have to move out of care at the age of 18, and a lot of the very clear evidence we got showed that this is not long enough. Most young people these days do not leave care at 18.
         </p>
         <p>
          I clearly remember somebody coming into my office, subsequent to us tabling this report, from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CREATE" rel="nofollow">
           CREATE
          </a>
          , which does excellent work and presented excellent information to the inquiry. This person was a young care leaver trying to find work, but she couldn't find accommodation. She was under the age of 21. She said, 'Rachel, the key thing you spend your whole time on is trying to work out where you're going to sleep. Where will I be safe? Where will I have a roof over my head?' She said, 'I can't think about trying to find work, because I'm so worried about where I'm going to sleep tonight. I spend my energy doing that.' She was under the age of 21 and she had to leave the care system. That is simply not good enough. We need to lift our game and increase the resources to family services and therapeutic models of care, and evidence based evaluations and reunification. The government talks about that in its response and notes it. We simply aren't providing enough resources, enough family supports or enough early intervention supports. When the budget is cut, guess what the first thing is to be cut: early intervention services. We put lots of effort into the court system and the child-protection system, and into supporting kids in foster care, but not into their families in the first place. This is particularly important for the number of Aboriginal kids being put in the out-of-home-care system and the lack of effort being put into reunification.
         </p>
         <p>
          I thoroughly support SNAICC's recommendation that we need a new approach. They talk about that in their program
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters" rel="nofollow">
           Family Matters
          </a>
          â€”a program I highly recommend and strongly support. It's a shame the government is not paying more attention to SNAICC's recommendations, in terms of Family Matters, where they talk about the need for better strategies to reduce Aboriginal and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
           Torres Strait Islander
          </a>
          poverty and homelessness, dealing with some of the underlying causes. Very importantly, it is about making sure there are Aboriginal peak organisations that are making the decisionsâ€”that are community controlled organisations making the decisions. That is absolutely critical. You would think, 20 years down the track from the
          <i>
           Bringing them home
          </i>
          report, that we would know that and that we would not have to be begging for that to occur. You would think it would be common sense.
         </p>
         <p>
          The other issue the government agrees with, which I was pleased to see but I have a note of caution about, is supporting the recommendation around the National Disability Insurance Agency making funding available for children with disability, because there are a large number of children with a disability going into out-of-home care. They are relying, unfortunately, on the Early Childhood Early Intervention approach. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
           NDIS
          </a>
          joint standing committee is currently looking at that. There are some very significant issues there. They shouldn't just be relying on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
           NDIA
          </a>
          picking up these issues, because there are very serious issues here.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government needs to be doing more about out-of-home care. They particularly need to be taking the lead in terms of the appalling number of Aboriginal children who are still going into out-of-home care. I urge the government to relook at this matter, to put effort into addressing this issue, or we will keep having the same issues. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
