        My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Ludwig. Given that the

         Western Australia

        n government has already moved to ban synthetic marijuana products but they are still being sold legally in all other states of Australia, what is the federal government proposing to do to ensure that this legal weed, which is being sprayed with a synthetic chemical that makes it have the same hallucinogenic effect as illegal cannabis, is banned in all states? Does the government think we should continue to make such products, which are designed to manipulate people's minds, freely available for purchase over the counter?

           On 16 June 2011 the Queensland government announced that it will be moving to ban synthetic cannabinoids under the Queensland Drugs Misuse Act. Fifteen emerging drugs will be captured under this change. Although there have been reports in other states, I understand that work is progressing in relation to these. Under the various state legislations it is a requirement that they deal with this under their similar drug misuse legislation in various places. In the National Drug Strategy of the Commonwealth we have a significant interest in working to tackle illicit drug issues through this portfolio. They have provided $350 million. Australia has seen a decline in the level of use of illicit drugs—particularly cannabis, methamphetamine and heroin—over the last 10 years.

                  turn to the fake cannabis issue? Commonwealth and state regulatory authorities are concerned about products which are reported to have the same effect as the illegal drug. The ingredients in these products are often not disclosed and their health effects are unknown. I implore people who are considering using them not to do so because of the unrelated health impacts. States can immediately ban such substances, as I indicated in answer to the primary question, under their own drugs and poisons legislation, and WA has moved that way.

                  is currently considering a request to prohibit a number of synthetic cannabinoids such as Kronic. This is independent of government and is based on intelligence and information available to the delegate. It is important to note that these scheduling decisions are recommendations to the jurisdictions so we can schedule and make those recommendations. The enforcement of restrictions will remain with the states.

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that there is some urgency and that these synthetic illegal type drugs have some dangerous side-effects, will the minister call an urgent meeting of all state attorneys-general to call for an immediate ban of these synthetic drugs across all states to reassert the government's anti-drug policy?

                    , state and territory authorities remain concerned about not just one product but multiple products which purport to have the same effect as illegal drugs. The Commonwealth is currently considering a request to prohibit a number of synthetic cannabinoids such as Kronic. This is independent of government and is based on evidence and information that is available. It is important to note that the scheduling decision puts it in the area where the states can act and the enforcement restrictions will remain with the states and territories.
