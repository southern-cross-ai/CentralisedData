        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Science, Senator Ronaldson. We learned this week that up to 200 jobs are at risk while the apparent merger of National

        Australia,

        </a>
        , with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        is being negotiated behind closed doors. NICTA is projected to contribute over $3 billion to Australia's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        and has been incubating and producing start-up business at an average of one new company every three months. Minister, are we going to discover that this so-called merger is a backdoor for cost-cutting and how do government promises square with the continual shedding of valuable jobs in the research sector?

         I thank the honourable senator for his question. I understand that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         board agreed to this proposed merger at its meeting on 30 April, that the N
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
          ICT
         </a>
         A board has agreed to it in principle and that CSIRO anticipates that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NICTA" rel="nofollow">
          NICTA
         </a>
         members will be asked to agree to changes required to its board and to the NICTA constitution
        </p>
        <p>
         The two organisations have begun working together on some projects. Formal ratification is required, but I understand that the merger will build a more impactful ICT capability for Australia by creating one of the largest single digital innovation teams in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the staff, I have a note here from the minister saying that it 'will create one of the world's largest cohorts of highly qualified ICT staff and the collective skill of this team will be used to keep Australia at the leading edge in science and innovation.' The current reduction in funding to NICTA requires a close inspection of all aspects of the merged body to reduce cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the recent Senate estimates hearing, which I think you might be referring to, and the 200 job losses, it may have an impact across both organisations, but I am confident CSIRO will do its utmost to increase external revenue to minimise this. Just in the last 13 seconds, you will appreciate that indeed—

If leadership, Mr President, cannot be shown in this place by Senator Wong, Mr Shorten, clearly, will need to step in.

                 Order! I just want to make the comment that I think this has been one of the worst question times—and there has been bad behaviour on both sides—but what we have just witnessed from my left was very disappointing. Could I ask that all senators just consider their behaviour, consider the duty they have to the public of Australia to behave respectfully in this chamber and let's move on with question time with a lot more decorum, fewer interjections—humorous and intellectual interjections occasionally are very good but not constantly, in a raised voice and continually from the same senators. Can we move on and demonstrate to the public of Australia that they should have confidence in this Senate.

                            <p>
                             I say to Senator Wang that the relationship between science, scientific organisations, the business community and education institutions is the only way that this nation will advance. The day before yesterday we announced an advanced manufacturing institute in Geelong.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We are determined to ensure through a variety of programs—and I will get you further information as I have only got 21 seconds left—that the entrepreneurship that drove this nation's growth is at the heart of what this government wants to achieve. We believe that appropriate partnerships between government, education and commerce will indeed drive that and we have many, many programs in place which will achieve that.
