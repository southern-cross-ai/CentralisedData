          . I regret that the coalition finds this cruelty amusing. I ask the minister: in relation to these acts of cruelty at the abattoir, is he also aware that this latest incident is the most recent in a shameful list of cruel incidents in abattoirs, such as in March this year with ex-racehorses at the Laverton knackery being beaten and dragged by tractors whilst still alive and the slaughter of fully conscious animals in

          abattoirs? Does the minister believe that these standards of treatment are acceptable in Australia?

           program on 20 March of the mistreatment of turkeys at Ingham's turkey abattoir in Tahmoor, south-west of Sydney.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Australian government does not condone the mistreatment of animals. The welfare of turkeys at this plant is overseen by the New South Wales government Food Authority. This footage was clearly unacceptable and I will be raising it with the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katrina_Hodgkinson" rel="nofollow">
            Katrina Hodgkinson
           </a>
           , because incidents of cruelty detected are actionable under the New South Wales Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and the matter, as I understand it—and I think that Senator Milne also understands it—is under investigation by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales Police
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           I always say in these instances that it is best left to the authorities to investigate these matters and to bring those who have allegations of mistreatment against them to the authority's attention so that they can be fully investigated. I always then add that it is not a matter for me to trample over that investigation, but I do think, like Senator Milne, that it was completely unacceptable vision that was portrayed of animal cruelty. I do not think that I can add too much more at this point. I can take on notice and get back to Senator Milne what the New South Wales government may say about this. It is well known that the New South Wales government and states and territories deal with animal welfare directly for domestic purposes.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister's admission that the behaviour at Ingham's abattoir was unacceptable and cruel, does the minister now concede that, in order to ensure that humane standards of animal treatment are in place right around the country and to give consumers confidence that the laws are being complied with, he supports constant

            monitoring in all abattoirs? Does he think that should be mandated nationally?

             I thank Senator Milne for her supplementary question. It is worth reiterating what I said in the primary answer. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             Food Authority does have the authority to ensure that plants comply with the Australian standard and any importing country requirements. It is responsible for overseeing animal welfare. Incidents of cruelty that are detected are actionable under the New South Wales Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and the matter is under investigation.

             In terms of the broad issue around

              CCTV
             </a>
             surveillance in abattoirs, I understand that animal welfare groups have been calling for mandatory video monitoring of workers at all abattoirs. I do understand that the New South Wales Greens plan to introduce amendments as well to the New South Wales Food Act to make it mandatory for all slaughterhouses to video the stunning and slaughtering of all animals. But these are clearly matters for the New South Wales government. I will of course be raising it with the minister in New South Wales—

               At the outset, can I say that the government does understand—and this is a very important point to be made again—that improved animal welfare is a crucial element of a strong and sustainable agricultural sector. No government has done more to improve animal welfare in this sector than the Gillard government. The government has this week noted a report looking at the possible model of an office of animal welfare. I will now take the opportunity to examine that report, because animal welfare does remain a priority for this government. I recognise that there is work to be done in this area but the primary responsibility for animal welfare issues does remain with the state and territories. There are a range of issues that would have to be explored in furthering any of those proposals. I do not want to go into the detail now but it is clear that this government takes its responsibilities very seriously.
