         I thank Senator Abetz for the question. As we all know, Australia is an island nation. We are bordered by three of the world's oceans. What that means for Australians is that ports are the gateway to our open trading economy. Anything that is done to interfere with our ports and to slow productivity has a direct impact on Australians. Exports, in fact, make up about a quarter of Australia's gross domestic product. As we know, ports also employ hundreds of thousands of Australians right across our great country. As we also know, Australians themselves rely on many imported goods in their everyday lives. In the lead-up to Christmas in particular, when people are out there spending money and businesses are looking to get access to the products that they need, we need to ensure our ports operate both smoothly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we do know is that there is an ongoing threat of further industrial action at our ports prior to Christmas. For all of those businesses out there who rely on getting their product into the country, this is a great worry. The Morrison government does, of course, continue to be briefed regularly on this threat and on supply chain pressures. The National Coordination Mechanism is meeting weekly with industry players in the lead-up to Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
         The one thing we continue to say to the parties involved in this dispute is 'Negotiate in good faith and please resolve your issues.' But, at the same time, the government's position is very, very clear. The Morrison government stands ready to take action, if needed, to protect the Australian economy from serious harm. We will stand up for all of those businesses out there, for all of those Australians out there, and make sure that at this time of year they have access to the goods they need.

             As we all know, inefficient ports end up being a tax on all of us. They end up costing Australians money. They can end up costing businesses jobs. That is not good for any of us, and that is why the Morrison-Joyce government has taken action to improve the productivity of our ports, not only through infrastructure projects but also through removing regulatory roadblocks for trade. We've introduced the simplified trade system, which has been streamlining compliance costs for Australian importers and exporters whilst upgrading our legacy

             systems.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whilst this is working, we know that productivity at our ports remains a challenge. This has been going on for a very long time, particularly impacting Australia's maritime supply chains. So, the Treasurer will release terms of reference for a

             inquiry into the efficiency of our maritime logistics system. We need to ensure that productivity on our ports is the best as it can be.

                 New South Wales
                </a>
                government, Senator Ayres; it is a potential Albanese government. That is actually the risk to port productivity in Australia: a potential Albanese government that is beholden to the unionsâ€”a government that is beholden to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">
                 MUA
                </a>
                . If you are beholden to the MUA, that means that if you do need to step up and take action to ensure that Australian families can get access to the goods and services they need and ensure that Australian businesses can get access to the product they need then you won't be able to say no. That is not a good thing, because, when you have an inefficient port system, when action is being taken that quite literally closes things down, you need a government that is strong; you need a government that understands that productivity on our ports is essential to ensuring that, in particular, our economic recovery from COVID-19 continues.
