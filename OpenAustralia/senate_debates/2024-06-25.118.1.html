         That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:

          State of Palestine
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been eight long months of Israel's full-blown genocide in Gaza—eight months in which Israel has slaughtered more than 37,000 Palestinians, including 15,000 children, and eight months in which Israel has relentlessly bombed schools, hospitals, ambulances, universities, places of worship and the tents where forcibly displaced Palestinians are taking refuge. Many thousands of Palestinians are missing, buried under the rubble. Nothing has been spared and no-one has been spared. Doctors who are returning from Gaza are calling it hell on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
         The need for justice for Palestine and the recognition of statehood has never been more urgent, and all Labor, who are in government, have offered are hollow words, tepid statements and expressions of concern, all of which Israel has ignored and will continue to ignore. When it comes to action, the Albanese government have absolutely failed. They have failed to join
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
          South Africa
         </a>
         's

          ICJ
         </a>
         case against Israel, failed to end the two-way arms trade with Israel, failed to sanction Israel, failed to expel the Israeli ambassador, failed to acknowledge the undeniable reality that what we are witnessing is a genocide—they can't even call it a genocide when it's happening right in front of their eyes—and failed to call for an end to Israel's apartheid and occupation. They have also failed so far to do the bare minimum and join the 147 countries which recognise the State of Palestine.
        </p>
        <p>
         So today we give them a chance to finally take this bare-minimum first step. Frankly, it is embarrassing and shameful that they haven't done this already. Today I say to every member of the Albanese government in this chamber, and in the other chamber as well: you should be embarrassed that it has come to this. You refused, you voted against, a similar Greens motion in the House just last month, and you should be even more ashamed and embarrassed if you don't vote for this motion today.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          The Greens
         </a>
         are the only party here with a conscience, the only party that gives a damn about Palestinian lives. And we will do all we can to drag the Albanese government kicking and screaming to take real action.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the heart of recognising Palestinian statehood must be the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to liberation. That includes the right of return for Palestinian refugees, the right to ownership and control over land and resources, and the right to live freely in dignity and equality in their homeland. But it cannot be the only step. The Labor government must take tangible actions which put an end to Israel's never-ending catalogue of human rights abuses, including the imposition of an arms embargo and sanctions. Just this year alone, the Albanese government has sanctioned Russia, Iran,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         and Myanmar, and it beggars belief that Israel is getting away scot-free. The occupation has to end. The apartheid wall must fall. The world must do to Israel what it did to South Africa: boycott, divestment and sanction. That broke the back of the racist apartheid regime in South Africa, and we need to do the same in Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last month, as I said, Labor cowardly voted against a motion similar to the one we're moving here today in the Senate by refusing to recognise Palestinian statehood. In doing so, Labor firmly cemented themselves as an enemy of the Palestinian people and as a traitor to their own party. And now, here we are: they really are trying to water down a very simple, straightforward motion to recognise Palestine as a state—ducking and weaving, trying to move amendments—rather than take a principled position, a position that is actually in their policy platform. You are playing political games while there is a genocide happening.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor is trying to escape accountability and to have it both ways: to pretend they care about Palestine when doing nothing for Palestine. And people can see right through it. You're trying to strip down a motion calling for a basic, fundamental act of justice to recognise Palestine. Well, I say to you, Labor: Our motion is clear and simple. We're not changing it. All it does is call on the Senate to recognise the state of Palestine, consistent with your own policy. We're not backing down. We are not going to change our motion. You have to decide whether you want to vote for it or against it.

         <p>
          Let's be clear: the only reason the Senate is considering this motion at present is that it was triggered by the events unfolded since Hamas's barbaric and brutal attacks of 7 October. And frankly, it is shameful that we find ourselves in the position of considering and debating something that Hamas has welcomed and Hamas considers to be an advance on the position since 7 October.
         </p>
         <p>
          This parliament, and certainly the parties of government, should have maintained the longstanding bipartisan position in relation to a two-state solution—a longstanding clearcut and bipartisan position that set in place clarity and conditions for how and when a two-state solution could be achieved that would enable an enduring and peaceful settlement between Israeli peoples and Palestinian peoples. We should never forget that Hamas, on 7 October, deliberately targeted civilians—the elderly, children, babies, young people at a music concert—and that they continue, to this day, to hold hostages and to hide those hostages amongst Palestinian civilians, placing those Palestinian civilians at even greater risk whilst their leadership hide in tunnels, underground, in a network extensively built with funds that should have instead been used for the advancement of Palestinian peoples. These are the facts that we face—a dangerous terrorist organisation that no country could, should or would live alongside, one sponsored by Iran as part of their plan of disruption around the region and the world—and yet Hamas sees parts of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
           UN
          </a>
          , some governments and certainly political parties like the Greens entertaining their demands or advancing on those demands. It is shameful, and we continue to stand very firmly against this.
         </p>
         <p>
          I note the amendment that the government has circulated and the correspondence from Senator Wong in relation to that amendment. That amendment is inadequate. It woefully fails to deal with what must clearly be the preconditions for a two-state solution for recognition of a future Palestinian state. That's why the coalition has circulated a further amendment to Senator Wong's proposed amendment. We are clear that, to have recognition of a Palestinian state, there must be recognition by Palestinian representatives and the Palestinian authority of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state. There must be no role for Hamas in a future Palestinian state, and inherent in that is that all hostages must be released. There must be reform of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority" rel="nofollow">
           Palestinian Authority
          </a>
          , including major security and governance reforms. There must be agreement and resolution of final status issues, including borders and rights of return, and there must be appropriate security guarantees between parties to ensure peace and security within recognised borders. These are essential preconditions to ensure that recognition and a two-state solution deliver an enduring and lasting peace for the people in Israel and for the Palestinian people. These are also the preconditions that used to be bipartisan, that have been spoken about by the government—some of them still are, even in Senator Wong's letter, and certainly in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations
          </a>
          —but all of them are consistent with what had been a long-standing bipartisan commitment to a two-state solution and how it would be achieved.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our appeal is for the government to come back to what had been a decades-long bipartisan position in Australia to support these preconditions for how and when we could recognise a Palestinian state as part of an enduring two-state solution that provided for peace and the prospect of prosperity and did not reward the likes of Hamas for the evil doings of October 7. Our support for any government consideration of amendments depends upon there being clarity that our amendment would get to be considered.

              </a>
              is deeply distressing for many Australians, including the many Australians with a connection to the region and loved ones that are directly impacted. The widespread human suffering we are witnessing in Gaza is completely unacceptable. This cannot continue, and the war must end. This devastating crisis demonstrates the need for a political solution to the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We know that the only way to break the cycle of violence and achieve an enduring peace is through a peace process leading to a two-state solution—a Palestinian state and the state of Israel living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. Because Israel's long-term security depends on a two-state solution, without it Israel will continue to face the insecurity of not being fully recognised in its region. Because Palestinian self-determination depends on a two-state solution, without it Palestinian's rightful aspiration for justice, prosperity and statehood will not be met.
             </p>
             <p>
              The world is trying to create momentum towards that. That's why, in the recent vote at the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
               UN
              </a>
              General Assembly, 143 countries, including Australia, expressed a wish for progress to lasting peace through a two-state solution. We voted in favour of the resolution because of this government's steadfast commitment to a two-state solution. Unlike some in this place, we have been clear in that throughout. The government has made clear that it will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause of peace. Like many in the international community, we have been frustrated by the lack of progress towards a two-state solution. And like Canada, Germany, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
               UK
              </a>
              and other partners, Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process; it could occur as part of a peace process.
             </p>
             <p>
              A Palestinian state cannot be in a position to threaten Israel's security, which means no role for Hamas. We want to see a reformed Palestinian authority that disavows violence and is ready to engage in a meaningful political process. To that end, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has directed the

               Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
              </a>
              to examine ways Australia can support reform of the

               Palestinian Authority
              </a>
              so that it can deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people. We want to see a commitment to peace in how the Palestinian Authority leads its people. The final status of core issues such as Jerusalem and the borders of a future Palestinian state should be defined through direct negotiations.

              It is now six months since Australia voted with 152 countries at the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
               United Nations
              </a>
              for a ceasefire. We support the comprehensive ceasefire proposal endorsed by the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
               UN Security Council
              </a>
              and want to see it fully implemented by both parties. We will continue to work with countries that support the peace process, so that all parties can agree to terms immediately. Any delay will only see more lives lost. Whilst Australia is not a central player, we have a respected voice, and we are using it to advocate for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians, increased humanitarian access and the release of hostages.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have pressed for these outcomes in persistent and extensive engagement with foreign counterparts, including in the Middle East as well as with partners in Europe, Canada, Japan, the UK, the

              and in our region. We have pressed the Netanyahu government directly, as have officials in Canberra and in Israel. We have pressed countries with influence over Hamas to secure the immediate and unconditional release of the remaining hostages, and we have committed $72.5 million to address urgent needs arising from the conflict in Gaza and the protracted refugee crisis in the region. We have been clear in our support and respect for the independence of the

              Given the distressing impact of the conflict in the Middle East and here at home, it is my hope that senators will send a clear statement in support of the international efforts. I advance the cause of the two-state solution to adjust an enduring peace, and I move:

                         The Australian government is working with the international community to create momentum for a lasting peace in the form of a two-state solution: a Palestinian state alongside the

                         . We know that it is the only way to break the cycle of violence. The momentum is what we saw in the recent vote in the

                          United Nations

                         General Assembly where 143 countries including Australia expressed our aspiration for Palestinian membership of the United Nations. Australia and a number of other countries including Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada have shifted our position so that recognition of a Palestinian state is no longer seen as being at the end of negotiations.

                         Australia is firmly part of the international effort to see recognition of a state of Palestine as a part of a peace process in support of a two-state solution and a just and enduring peace. It is widely recognised that major security and governance reforms are needed. At the foreign minister's direction, the

                         is examining ways Australia can support reform of the

                         so that it can deliver on the needs of the Palestinian people. The government's amendment to this motion reflects the work Australia is contributing in the international community. Given the distressing impact of the conflict in the

                         and here at home, it is the government's hope that senators will send a clear statement of support to international efforts to advance the cause of the two-state solution and a just and enduring peace.

                           continues to deny Palestinians of the right to self-determination and continues to dispossess them of their land. This injustice must be rectified in ways that allow both Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace, security and equality and to exercise self-determination as described by the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
                            UN
                           </a>
                           Charter. Self-determination is central here. True self-determination must be supported by the Australian government and by this parliament for Palestinian peoples. Self-determination means you do not prescribe the end point and conclusion of the self-determined process.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           We must recognise the reality that the actions of the State of Israel, the actions of its many governments, have systematically worked to render a two-state solution unachievable. We must have an Australian government which does recognise Palestinian statehood and we must have a government that supports the self-determination of Palestinian peoples. We must do so in a framework that enables that self-determination to be genuine and authentic. We must have an Australian government and a parliament that is willing to recognise that the actions of the State of Israel, both in the invasion of Gaza and before the invasion of Gaza, have continued to perpetuate a deep and profound violation of the rights of Palestinian peoples. We must have an Australian government willing to condemn and reject all forms of violence, especially against civilians, whether it's perpetrated by states, organisations or individuals, and it must be able to do that while recognising the rights of Palestinian people to resist Israeli occupation in accordance with international law. We must have an Australian government that is able to oppose all forms of racism, religious or cultural intolerance, and discrimination in Australia and internationally while rejecting the suggestion that any criticism of the State of Israel or its policies inherently constitutes antisemitism, when that in itself is an antisemitic idea.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           We must have peace and justice for Palestinian peoples. That is what we here in the Greens, with like-minded members on the crossbench, will continue to work in solidarity with Palestinian peoples to achieve.
