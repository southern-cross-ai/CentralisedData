           Well, I understand you do. Standing order 191 applies, I am told, only during the actual debate. The debate has terminated. I am suggesting, Senator Boswell, that you need to seek leave.

               Mr President
              </a>
              , I rise on a point of order. Standing order 191 says this, and I will read it in full:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              A senator who has spoken to a question may again be heard, to explain some material part of the senator’s speech which has been misquoted or misunderstood, but shall not introduce any new matter, or interrupt any senator speaking, and no debatable matter shall be brought forward or debate arise ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Ever since Senator Boswell was clearly misquoted by Senator Brown—and deliberately I suggest—there have been other people speaking. The words of the standing order clearly make no reference to speaking in the same debate. I am not sure quite where that comes from. It does not say it in the words of the standing order. If you are suggesting to me that there is some precedent that should be followed then I cannot see how any precedent could overcome the clear sense of the words there. Senator Boswell was not able to interrupt any other speaker speaking and ever since he was misquoted other speakers have been speaking and then there was a vote called and he was unable to do it then and he has done it at the very first time that he has possibly had the opportunity to do it. Mr President, I think procedural fairness requires that where Senator Boswell claims to have been misquoted—and I am sure he has been—he should be given the opportunity of putting it on the record.

                    Yes, but you then sought it by leave. I am interpreting it—say if I am interpreting wrongly—that if you are doing it under 191 leave was not granted. If you are doing it under standing order 190, 'Personal explanations', it says:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    By leave of the Senate, a senator may explain matters of a personal nature, although there is no question before the Senate, ...
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That is the point that is made in 190. It goes on:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    but such matters may not be debated.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Say you had sought that under 190; 190 is by leave.

                        , I rise on a point of order. I disagree with your ruling but it is your ruling, although I would urge you not to get too attached to it. In the situation that Senator Boswell has found himself in, can you indicate whether the standing order requires that he cannot interrupt any other senator? In all of the instances in the time since Senator Boswell was misquoted there have been people speaking, so he has had no opportunity until now. There was a vote called and he could not do it then. As soon as the vote was over, he exercised his rights under 191 and was refused. How could anyone who has been misquoted possibly have remedies in this chamber?

                         A senator who has spoken to a question before the Senate may explain, without leave, some part of the senator’s speech which has been misquoted or misunderstood, but may not interrupt a senator speaking or introduce any new or debatable matter (

                         191). This right to correct misquotations, misunderstandings and, in practice, misrepresentations of a senator’s words may be used only where a senator has spoken in a debate, and must be used during that debate or at the conclusion of the debate. It cannot be used to respond to matters in debates which have occurred at an earlier stage in the proceedings. It also cannot be used simply to respond to arguments raised in debate; to use the procedure a senator must claim to be misquoted, misunderstood or misrepresented.

                         That is the ruling of President Baker. I must say that I would still have to stick with what I had said, Senator Macdonald.

                                    as doing their job'. What I said in the Senate was:
