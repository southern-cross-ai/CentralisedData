        My question is to Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Can the minister confirm that his department told him that to rely on the Biosis report to block the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_Hills" rel="nofollow">

           already granted for hundreds of wind turbines on the Victorian coast? Didn’t the minister’s department warn him of this before he alone decided that he would knock off the

             Certainly much better than mine! The point that Senator Brandis made, and I repeat it, is this: departments do give ministers advice on a daily basis, I think it is fair to say. Ministers read the advice. They often seek third-party advice and take other soundings. A diligent minister will do that.

                Perhaps—and God help Australia if this ever happens—if Senator O’Brien does become a minister one day, he will simply receive departmental advice and then, without thought, discussion or even reading it, tick the ‘yes, I agree’ box. He would be sitting in his desk being lazy.

                    Order! I have continually asked people on my left to come to order today, and obviously you are not listening. I would ask you again to come to order and allow the minister to try and answer the question.

                     , I rise on a point of order: Senator Campbell is intent on introducing matters in relation to another matter of another former member of parliament. The question that I asked was about the way that this minister responded to his department’s advice. He draws a very long bow in trying to take this back to the

I happen to believe my department is not right about that. I do not think there is a risk to other coastal developments, and one of the reasons I can actually demonstrate that they are wrong in relation to that is: since I made the

It is your choice.
