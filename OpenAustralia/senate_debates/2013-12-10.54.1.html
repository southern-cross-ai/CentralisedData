        My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sinodinos. Can the Assistant Treasurer advise the Senate about the costs imposed on jobs, business and the economy by the mining tax? What is the government doing to restore confidence and certainty in the mining sector?

         I thank the honourable senator for his question. The mining tax was an unnecessary and poorly designed tax that burdened the industry with excessive compliance costs. It damaged international investor confidence in Australia, particularly in our resources and energy sector, and it made the industry less internationally competitive. The whole point of the tax was to extract economic rents. It did nothing of the kind. Atlas Iron recently outlined to the Senate economics committee the impact of the mining tax on its operation, noting:

         It was adding to the risk of these major projects. The MRRT added extra complexity administratively—new administrative and compliance burdens.

          You don't like to hear this, do you? You don't like to hear the consequences of what you did to one of the big industries of Australia, one of the industries of the future. The mining tax has already cost over $50 million in administration but raised only $400 million. How is that for a return on the industry? Treasury confirmed in the recent Senate economics committee hearing that far more companies need to comply with the tax than have actually paid the tax to date. Approximately 235 companies have registered for the tax and 65 more are due to register should the repeal of the tax not proceed; however, fewer than 20 companies actually incurred a

           MRRT
          </a>
          liability in 2012-13.
         </p>
         <p>
          If we want a vibrant energy and resources sector, we have to repeal the MRRT and we have to repeal the carbon tax. The opportunity we have over the next few days is to complete that task.

            The mining tax, as I mentioned before, has raised very little revenue. It began life as a $49.5 billion resources superprofits tax and then the people opposite subcontracted out their tax policy. Senator Cameron talks about figures in the mining industry. It was the Labor government that subcontracted out its mining tax policy to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
             BHP
            </a>
            , Rio and Xstrata. It then came up with a $26.5 billion estimate that then became $4 billion and to date it has raised $400 million. Off the back of that you promised over the forward estimates $16.7 billion of spending. We have raised $400 million but there is $16.7 billion of spending on schoolkids bonuses, low-income super, small business write-offs, the superannuation guarantee, loss carry-back and the income support bonus. It is spending we cannot afford.

                I am happy to report that the coalition have had a consistent position. From the very beginning, we saw the damage that that mining tax was going to do to one of the sectors on which we are building Australia's future. We made it clear at the time: we would not support the mining tax or the spending of the former government that was promised off the back of that tax. We thought it was irresponsible to first slug a major industry in that way and then promise all this spending on the back of that. What a cruel hoax on the schoolkids of Australia, low-income Australians and small business, to promise all this spending off the back of this ever-receding tax. The now Prime Minister, in his budget reply speech in May, outlined that the coalition would not continue with the measures that were going to be funded by the mining tax, because the mining tax was not raising revenue. You were telling the schoolkids of Australia: 'It's okay to borrow to pay yourself a bonus.' We could not afford it. We were not going to go ahead with it. And that is our stance after the election.
