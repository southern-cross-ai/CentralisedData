          I think I speak on behalf of most Australians today when I say that they are disappointed, frustrated and just a little bit angry that yesterday a Japanese harpoon fleet left Japanese waters to travel for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
           Southern Ocean
          </a>
          , to what is deemed to be an international whale sanctuary, under the guise of doing research whaling, which has been found by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court" rel="nofollow">
           International Court
          </a>
          of Justice to not be an excuse to slaughter whales. In fact, their actions have been found to be illegal. The motion in front of the Senate today is a message from the parliament that this government needs to take strong action. It needs to raise this issue at the highest level, with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">

             The Australian government is very disappointed by Japan's decision to resume whaling in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
              Southern Ocean
             </a>
             . We remain opposed to all forms of commercial whaling and strongly support the global moratorium on commercial whaling. All information necessary for the conservation and management of whales can be obtained using non-lethal methods. The Australian government welcomed the decision of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court" rel="nofollow">
              International Court
             </a>
             of Justice in March 2014 that found Japan's whaling program in the Southern Ocean was not for the purposes of scientific research and ordered that program to cease. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for the Environment continue to make high-level representations to the government of Japan expressing Australia's deep disappointment with the Japanese decision to recommence its unnecessary whaling program. The government is considering all options in response to the Japanese decision, including monitoring.
