        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women, Senator Payne. Can the minister update the Senate on what the government has done, and is doing, for Australians to keep them safe from the coronavirus both overseas and here at home?

         I thank Senator Brockman for his question. The safety of Australians both at home and overseas is, of course, the primary responsibility of any government. The government's decisive actions have all been taken on the advice of health professionals, the chief medical officer, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and in the interests of public health.
        </p>
        <p>
         To Australians, I can say that we are well prepared but this is also an evolving situation, as shown by today's very recent reports that some 3,700 people are currently being quarantined on a cruise ship harboured in Yokohama, Japan. I can confirm that of the Australians onboard that ship, two have tested positive for coronavirus and will be taken to Japanese medical facilities for treatment. We are making inquiries about the welfare of other Australian passengers and any need for consular assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of the comprehensive government response, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         activated 24-hour-a-day seven-day-a-week comprehensive operations at our own crisis centre. Staff on the phones have taken more than 7,760 inquiries since 23 January. Almost 2,000 people have contacted our embassy and our consulates in China seeking advice or assistance. We have raised our travel advice to level 4 for China: 'Do not travel'.
        </p>
        <p>
         The work of those staff, and that of other government agencies, has resulted in the assisted departure of 243 Australians this week, including 89 people under 16 and five infants. We have been focused on making isolated and vulnerable Australians our priority. They have entered quarantine to ensure their own health and the safety of the broader Australian population. Our approach continues to be the case as we work with agencies and with Chinese authorities towards a second assisted departure, hopefully later this week.

            As China is dealing with the extensive coronavirus outbreak, we have been in regular contact with Chinese officials both here in Canberra and in Beijing and across our posts in China. I have previously acknowledged the cooperative approach of Chinese authorities, including its efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus, and work with international partners and organisations, including of course the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
             World Health Organisation
            </a>
            , to share information. Our assisted departure flight on 3 February, and our planning towards a second flight, is greatly assisted by the cooperation of Chinese authorities. I have spoken with my counterpart,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi" rel="nofollow">
             Wang Yi
            </a>
            , in turn, to continue to offer China our support. We were very pleased to be able to send a supply of personal protective equipment on our first flight to Wuhan, and in consultation with China we'll consider what more we can do in that regard as well.

I want to thank New Zealand for assisting with the departure of 35 Australians from Wuhan last night as well as a number of Pacific islander, Timorese and other national citizens on that flight. There are no known coronavirus cases in the Pacific or New Zealand, but we are working closely with our neighbours and with the
