        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson. Can the minister advise the Senate of what steps the government is taking to address the mental health challenges facing veterans and their families and of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Seselja for his question about this very, very important issue. Tackling the mental health challenges faced by veterans and their families is a key policy priority for this government. Each year the

         spends some $166 million on veterans' mental health. This is demand driven; it is not capped. This is part of a $12.5 billion budget—

          I would have thought that this matter probably had the support of all honourable senators. If it hasn't then that is a reflection on them, not on me. That is part of a $12.5 billion budget—

         <p>
          that is an extraordinary interjection—including income support compensation and health care. Consultation formed part of the approach of this government when in opposition over the three years prior to the election. That consultation—and I did 110 veterans forums around the country—formed part of our veterans policy—a policy which was not matched by the

           Australian Labor Party
          </a>
          , because they had no policy at all. They had done no consultation at all. As a result of that consultation, last Thursday I announced a new way forward for consultation with veterans and the wider community about veterans' mental health, and that will be in the form of

         <p>
          This reconstituted PMAC will be dedicated to considering the needs of veterans and the mental health challenges they face. The PMAC will consider high-level and strategic issues and look to identify gaps in available services and innovative approaches to address them. It will provide advice to the Prime Minister and me about future directions for veterans mental health policy. Until recently—

I would like today to pay tribute to the enormous contribution that the Stokes family makes towards veterans.

              Again, I thank the senator very much for his question. As minister I have streamlined four committees into two which are providing internal advice to me. The first forum deals with the needs of our recently returned veterans, and that will be the Younger Veterans—Contemporary Needs Forum, which has combined the old Emerging Issues Forum and the Operational Working Party to focus specifically on the needs of younger and returned veterans. The other forum is the National Aged and Community Care Forum, which specifically addresses the challenges facing older veterans, and their health issues, and those faced by their families. I am confident this new approach will ensure the government receives the very best targeted advice about how we can tackle mental health challenges. As I said in my earlier answer to the senator, we spend $166 million on mental health services. We are doing more, but there is always more that can be done. We might need to recognise that in the last 20 years some 72,000 young—
