          John Cain
         </a>
         recalls, it was Clyde and he who promoted the activities of the Melbourne University Labor Club and the Victorian Young Labor association into strong and effective student and policy organisations which produced a number of future Victorian Labor politicians and activists. Clyde's early career was as a solicitor specialising in industrial law, particularly industrial accidents. He co-founded the law firm which today is known as Holding Redlich. In 1962 he was elected as the member for Richmond to the Victorian parliament. In 1967 Clyde became leader of the parliamentary Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition, a position which he held until 1977. His 10 years of party leadership were a tumultuous time in which Labor lost two state elections, saw factional fighting which led to federal intervention and a leadership challenge from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Jones" rel="nofollow">
          Barry Jones
         </a>
         , which Clyde remarked as being unsuccessful on the grounds that 'Quiz kids can't count'. After the second election loss, he resigned the leadership. He successfully won the seat of Melbourne Ports at the 1977 federal election, and held the seat at the following seven elections, finally retiring in 1998 after 21 years in the Commonwealth parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an authentic and influential Labor politician, Clyde was loved and hated—often at the same time. He bore the scars of his upbringing between the

         </a>
         and the

          Second World War
         </a>
         and the exper­iences of a political party under stress during the 1950s. For some, he was a 'cynic with decency', others described him as 'an old style' Labor numbers man who was prepared to promote
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
          Bob Hawke
         </a>
         's leadership aspira­tions, but for many he is remembered as a competent and conscientious adminis­trator who took on vested interests after he became the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the first Hawke government in 1983.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clyde strongly pushed for uniform national Aboriginal land rights, which at the time were not fully supported within the Labor leadership, or by the mining industry or state governments. As the history of his time shows, there was intense lobbying against land rights and, without the direct support of his ministerial colleagues, he was unable to prevail. In 1987, after nearly four years, he was removed from Aboriginal Affairs to have his responsibilities focused on the lesser portfolio of Employment Services and Youth Affairs. Within 12 months, his main portfolio was switched to Transport and Communications Support, and finally to cabinet in the portfolio of Immigration,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Local Government
         </a>
         and Ethnic Affairs. Not many ministers would have enjoyed the experiences of having three such disparate portfolios in such a short period. As part of a wider reshuffle in 1989, Prime Minister Hawke demoted Clyde to the Arts and Territories portfolio. By the accounts of the time, this was a messy, widely leaked demotion, which Clyde resisted. In 1990 he went to the backbench and remained there until he retired in 1998.
        </p>
        <p>
         It would be misleading to define a person's achievements in one paragraph. Yet there were a number that I am sure he would have been enormously proud of: the handing back of Uluru to its Indigenous owners; the appointment of

        </p>
        <p>
         On behalf of the government and, in particular, Victorian senators, we mark his passing on 31 July 2011 with respect. We offer our sympathies to his surviving family: his second wife, Judy, and their daughter, Isabella, and his first wife, Margaret, and their children, Peter, Jenny and Danny, and the four grandchildren.

         I was lucky enough to be able to attend the memorial this morning in Melbourne, along with those from both sides of parliament, in recognition of his work. It was a very fond recollection of Clyde's life, with many very funny stories told. There were many stories about his determination to stand up to the worst of the elements of the Victorian socialist Left—the Bill Hartleys and the George Crawfords—who pushed such divisive policies. Clyde was remembered fondly for being part of those who made the success of the Victorian Labor Party their mission. His leadership in standing up to those elements and his willingness to take risks in pursuit of sound public policies, at the expense of support from the likes of Crawford and Hartley, were remembered fondly. The intervention that became the foundation for the success of the Victorian Labor Party governments of John Cain,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bracks" rel="nofollow">

          John Brumby
         </a>
         goes back to that period when Clyde Holding was one of the key figures who democratised the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. This was fondly remarked on by some who were more directly involved than myself.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am lucky enough to have inherited the benefits of Clyde Holding's work. I doubt that I and a number of people in this chamber today would be able to stand up in a federal Labor government if it had not been for the courage and determination of Clyde Holding in overturning those who sought to put warped ideology ahead of the needs of the Victorian and Australian public. I, like many others in this chamber, will miss Clyde Holding.

           ALP

          and the people of Victoria. He served 15 years in state parliament and 21 years in the federal parliament, making a total innings of public service of some 36 years. That is a huge innings in anybody's language. To remain opposition leader for 10 years is a huge task. Losing elections always leads people to seek the silver bullet—a new leader is all you need—so to retain the confidence, albeit amidst challenges, for so long and then be promoted to federal politics is an exceptional accolade.

         <p>
          From there, a distinguished ministerial career followed. Senator Conroy, on behalf of the Labor government, has provided a detailed, eloquent tribute. I do not seek to add to that but to simply say that as a coalition we note his resilience, his skill as an orator and his passion. We also note that he was deservedly seen as a respected friend of the Jewish community. The coalition acknowledges the service of the Hon. Clyde Holding to our nation. Our condolences are expressed to his widow and his four children.

           and minister in the Hawke Labor government, Clyde Holding. The name 'Clyde Holding' was first noticed by members of the Labor Party when as a 24-year-old law student in 1955, following the catastrophic split in the party, he was appointed as the new antigrouper secretary of the Victorian Young Labor Association. It was to be the start of a very long life in politics. As a young lawyer in the 1950s, Clyde specialised in industrial accidents and went on to establish, with other Labor lawyers, the law firm Holding, Ryan and Co., now Holding Redlich, which was later to become a leading Melbourne legal practice.

Needless to say, he easily won the seat in the May 1962 by-election, with a thumping 66 per cent of the primary vote, commencing 36 years of continuous service in state and federal parliament. In the early years he established his member's office in the front room of his house in Waltham Street, Richmond. He maintained cordial relations with the Richmond local Labor machine, those dynasties of the Loughnan and

           's wonderful description of Labor's campaign launch in 1964, when Clyde was seeking re-election after his first term. Barry himself of course, as we have heard, contested a leadership battle against Clyde in 1976, leading to that famous comment from Clyde, 'Quiz kids can't count'. Barry Jones vividly recalled the 1964 campaign launched by Labor opposition leader

          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We sat in the hall, hoping for the best but fearing the worst. The speech had been prepared by the ALP head office, with minimal consultation with Stoneham. He was to read the speech from large sheets of pasteboard on which the text had been written. At the top left corner of the first sheet his name, 'CLIVE', had been written in capitals as a cue to avoid confusion. Unfortunately, the curves of the letter 'C' had been drawn over-generously, so the letter resembled an 'O'.

          <p class="italic">
           stood by the first pasteboard sheet, pointing to the name 'CLIVE'. The Leader looked baffled and said nothing. Allan Fraser tapped the name 'CLIVE' again. Silence. He tapped a third time. Clive Stoneham smiled, relaxed and mysteriously began his televised campaign election speech with the words, 'Thank you, Olive'.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Worse was to come. The speech was due to run on television for 30 minutes, but Stoneham finished after 25. Inviting questions from the floor was not considered to be a good idea, so Dinny Lovegrove, Deputy Leader and an excellent impromptu speaker, was called on. Unhappily, he reached back to his deep memory as a Trotskyist in the 1930s. He began:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           'We know what this election is about: the struggle between the rich and the poor. We know who our enemies are: the kind of people who have two cars in the garage, central heating and a sprinkler system in the lawn. And on their walls, they have something that looks as if two cockroaches have been crawling about in Indian ink, a piece of so-called modern art!'

           It fell to Clyde Holding, after Labor suffered its fifth consecutive defeat in the 1967 Victorian state election, to succeed Clive Stoneham and take on the tough job of party leader. His 10 years of leadership coincided with a party struggling to deal with the impact of the split, a weak and ineffective parliamentary team, a state parliamentary organisation overwhelmingly focused on internal party matters, and Victorian politics dominated by

           . Clyde Holding led Labor in three successive election losses in 1970, 1973 and 1976. For Clyde these years must have been as frustrating as they were gruelling. Clyde was a committed campaigner against the death penalty in Victoria. He was an active and vocal opponent of the death penalty cases of Robert Peter Tait in 1962 and of

           Clyde was arrested at one protest against the hanging of Ronald Ryan. He used to recount with great amusement the story of how the local police sergeant had ordered a compliant constable to go down to the demo and pick out the biggest yobbo he could find and bring him in. That yobbo was Clyde. Back at the station Clyde was asked for his name, which he gave,

           ; his occupation, which he gave, lawyer and member of parliament; and was bowled over by the next question: 'Can you read or write?' Clyde survived the experience.

           Clyde was a tough operator in a tough environment against an equally tough opponent, Henry Bolte. On one occasion he received a grudging compliment from Bolte at an end-of-year function. I have been told that Bolte said of Clyde Holding, 'I don't have a son but if I did have one I'd like him to be like you—dirty, hard and rotten.' Praise indeed from Henry Bolte.

           Clyde made the move to federal politics in 1977 when he contested Labor preselection for Melbourne Ports, which had been held by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Crean" rel="nofollow">
            Frank Crean
           </a>
           for 26 years. He was up against a very strong candidate in Frank's son, Simon, but repeating the pattern of his 1962 preselection success he won the ballot by the narrowest of margins: one vote. Clyde represented Melbourne Ports for 21 years from 1977 to 1998. Unlike his career in the Victorian parliament, spent entirely on the opposition benches, he served in the federal parliament throughout the years of the Hawke and Keating governments.

           From 1983 to 1990 he served as a minister and for a short period in cabinet. As Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the Hawke government from 1983 to 1987, he placed Aboriginal land rights firmly on the national agenda. The handing back of Uluru to its traditional owners in 1985 in the face of hostile opposition, particularly from the

           affairs long before they became mainstream issues. He was deeply frustrated by opposition to his plans to recognise native title years before the High Court's Mabo decision.

           He concluded his ministerial career with responsibility for the arts. Not all ministers for the arts have been passionate about the arts themselves but Clyde was widely read. He was a Shakespearean tragic, a collector of paintings, including Aboriginal barks, and a lover of music. He played a central role in the Commonwealth's receipt of the great gift of

           After Labor was returned in the 1990 federal election and after service in five portfolios Clyde stayed on the back bench until his retirement from parliament at the 1998 election. I served in the federal parliamentary Labor Party with Clyde for nine years. He had a quirky sense of humour, always seemed easygoing, was a prodigious reader, was curious and certainly was very skilful on his feet. He was a stump orator of the very highest calibre. More than that, he was exceptionally effective in parliamentary debate. And he was deeply committed to Labor values.
