        I wish to provide senators with an update on the incredible humanitarian work of the St John Eye Hospital in the

        . Senators would be aware from my previous contributions to the Senate of the amazing work that hospital staff are doing at great peril to themselves. It is very necessary work to ensure that those suffering receive care despite the ongoing conflict. St John has only one reason for being: serving the sick, regardless of their religion or origin and regardless of whether there is war or peace. Senators would also be aware that I am honoured to be a member of the Order of St John and a longstanding volunteer with

        .

        The decision of the Order of St John in 1882 to found an eye hospital was inspired by the highest humanitarian aim: to alleviate the suffering caused by eye disease. To date, the hospital has served the people of the Holy Land for over 140 years and treated in excess of 15 million people. This is an incredible achievement, having regard to the political uncertainties that, unfortunately, mark this region. I recently had the privilege of talking to Dr Ahmad Ma'ali, the chief executive officer of the hospital. I thank him for being so generous with his time, especially given the challenges for the hospital that he must navigate as its leader. He briefed me on the incredible work that the hospital staff are doing to ensure that care is continuing to be delivered to those in need despite the ravages of war.

        The hospital in Gaza is the most affected of the St John clinics, and the building has suffered damage. In response, St John is operating multiple satellite sites and clinics, which enable it to continue to provide care. Tragically, two St John nurses have been killed in the conflict, as well as family members of hospital staff. My thoughts and prayers are with their loved ones. They will be remembered. All staff continue to be paid and supported, thanks to the incredible generosity of the global St John community. Clinics have faced difficulties in obtaining supplies but, despite these challenges, hospital staff have operated on more than 6,000 patients since the conflict began and continue to find innovative ways to deliver eye care. The St John global community is committed to ensuring that, after the conflict, the hospital in Gaza will be repaired and rebuilt so that we might continue our important humanitarian work. Again, I thank Dr Ahmad for his leadership, courage and dedication. He and his staff are an example to us all, and their work is in the highest tradition of the Order of St John. Pro fide, pro utilitate hominum.
