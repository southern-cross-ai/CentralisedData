        by leave—I thank the Senate for its cooperation. We thought we would extend for 10 minutes to allow for party leaders to thank all senators and staff for their contribution to the efficient running of the Senate this year. As we break for Christmas, I know the parliamentarians are relieved but I am sure the staff are very relieved as well to see the back of us. I just ran into a journalist who said, ‘Would you please go home.’ That was not personally directed at me; it was directed at the whole parliamentary team.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish all staff of the Senate and the parliament generally best wishes for Christmas, and I hope they are able to have some time off to spend with their families. I never cease to marvel at the courtesy and service afforded to senators by staff in this building. Despite our behaviour and demands, they always treat people with enormous respect and courtesy and provide service in the best traditions of the Public Service. Obviously we have had a difficult few weeks. I know my colleagues on the other side of the chamber had a very difficult few weeks. Having been there and done that, I do not envy them that time. I am sure they will be very glad to get a break from that. We went through it, though I am not sure whether we went through it with quite the intensity or whether we achieved the spectacular levels seen in the last couple of weeks. But we have been there and we do understand the pain.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as thanking staff, I want to particularly mention Senator Wong, who has done a fantastic job for us on a very difficult piece of legislation and economic policy. I know she has to go to Copenhagen, but I wish her a break over the summer period. I also thank Senators Ludwig and O’Brien, who have been responsible for the very difficult job of getting the government’s legislation through and managing this chamber in a minority position. To Senator Minchin, the minor parties and the independents, I wish them all an enjoyable break. I hope they get time to spend with their families. I thank you,

         , I thank you for all you have done this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank you, Mr President, for the way you have presided over this chamber so professionally and, I think, fairly and impartially throughout this year. I thank the government for the extent to which there has been cooperation between the government and the opposition. As we all know, to make this chamber work at all cooperation is essential. It is not like the House of Representatives. Unless there is some degree of cooperation, nothing will happen in this chamber. I thank them at least for that. I thank the government for their sympathies for the interesting week or two that we have just had. We are trying to learn from the Labor Party, as best we can, how to manage these affairs—perhaps we are still learning.
        </p>
        <p>
         May I also express my sympathies to the government, who have no doubt been receiving phone calls from Mr Rudd wherever he may be, saying, ‘What on earth are you guys doing?’ We wish Mr Rudd a happy Christmas as well. I particularly want to thank Senator Parry for the tremendous job he has done this year wearing two hats for the opposition, as Chief Opposition Whip and as Manager of Opposition Business—a unique combination. He has done superbly well and we thank him for that.

           I think he might be back in the job. Something tells me he is back! While this year has been interesting, next year will be even more interesting—it being an election year, one way or the other. The government have an interesting decision to make now that, as I understand it, according to section 57 there may be the grounds for a double dissolution. We all await with interest the decision of the government. Next year is an election year in any event. I certainly intend to, and I hope all senators do, have a good, long and relaxing Christmas break and come back refreshed for what no doubt will be another entertaining year.

            by leave—I want to say a big thank you to all the staff involved in serving senators. They serve us with great passion and professionalism. I thank them sincerely for all their work. I asked
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Evans" rel="nofollow">
             Harry Evans
            </a>
            the other day whether he had ever seen anything like the end of this year. He said, ‘No.’ I suppose he is going out with a big bang given what we have seen lately. I want to say a big thank you to Harry. To Rosemary, I am sure you will do a tremendous job in filling Harry’s very big shoes.
