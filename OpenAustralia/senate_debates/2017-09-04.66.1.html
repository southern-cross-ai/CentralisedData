         I thank Senator Fawcett for his question. The strong cooperation that we have and that we continue to build with our partners and allies across the region is indeed crucial for the safety and security of Australia and for regional stability and security. This morning I spoke with my counterpart in Japan, Minister Onodera, to discuss
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         's ongoing destabilising behaviour, including, of course, the claimed nuclear test yesterday and the 29 August ballistic missile launch that overflew northern Japan. Australia and Japan have both unequivocally condemned the illegal tests and call further upon all nations to implement the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         sanctions against North Korea. It is vital that Australia works cooperatively with its partners and allies to address the security challenges in the region. We are stronger when we work together. Indeed, in the
         <i>
          2016 Defence white paper
         </i>
         we increased funding for international engagement because we recognised the need for our international partnerships to more effectively address common threats. It was never more important than we have seen in recent days and weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of this increased engagement, in the last fortnight I visited Singapore, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam to share our views on the region and discuss how we can work together to address them. Each of the ministers with whom I met also shared their concerns about not just the destabilising behaviour of North Korea but also the increasing challenges to the rules-based global order and the rising threat of terrorism in our region, well illustrated by the events in the southern Philippines. Australia is strongly committed to engaging broadly and to resisting efforts to undermine the current rules-based order. Only through unity of purpose on these issues will Australia and our partners be able to sustain a system that benefits all nations and builds both regional stability and prosperity.

            On Wednesday this week I will travel to the Republic of Korea to meet with Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon and my counterpart, Song Young-moo, to discuss the security situation on the Korean peninsula and further strengthening the Australia-Republic of Korea defence relationship. It's fair to say that Australia and the Republic of Korea are close partners that share a long history of security cooperation. Like Australia, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROK" rel="nofollow">
             ROK

            is a

            </a>
            ally, a democracy, a like-minded middle power and one of our key economic partners. While I am in Korea, I will deliver the key note address to the Seoul Defence Dialogue, which is a major regional forum for fostering understanding and cooperation on regional and global security issues. We strongly support
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
             South Korea
            </a>
            and the United States as they work to address the challenges of

             North Korea
            </a>
            . We are supportive of efforts to forge regional and multilateral solutions to enhance security across the Indo-Pacific and to deal with the threats that North Korea poses to regional security.

               , I am travelling to the Philippines to meet with my counterpart, Secretary Delfin Lorenzana. The siege of Marawi city by Daesh-aligned forces poses a threat to Australia's interests and to regional security. As Daesh comes under increasing pressure in Iraq and Syria, Australia will continue to work with our partners and allies across the region to prevent foreign fighters from spreading their toxic extremism in the Indo-Pacific.

This contribution builds on our extensive program of regional counterterrorism capacity building and engagement—an issue on which I also engaged in my visits in the previous fortnight. We continue to review our commitment to the Philippines. We have offered further support, and this will form the basis of my discussions.
