         One thing I can say: I know that the Nationals representatives in each of those electorates that you mentioned, Senator Ketter, know that their electorates are going to be far better off under a coalition government than they're ever going to be under those on the other side. Some of the questions that will be absolutely central to any decision about who will represent them at the next election will be: 'Who is the best at running the economy? Who provides the best growth for the economy? Who is best placed to ensure that we have jobs into the future, not only for myself but—

           The point of order is on relevance. The question goes to what advice the minister has sought about the inequitable distribution in National Party seats.

             , my apologies. I should have simply rejected the premise of that question, which I do now. The most important thing is not only jobs for those people who are in those electorates right now but that more and more people are thinking about the future. They're thinking about the future of their children. They're wondering if their business will be a business of the future or a victim of those on the other side, who are economically illiterate. I know that everybody who lives in each and every one of those electorates will be saying, 'It is only the coalition that can provide support for businesses, support for partnerships and support for growth and jobs.' There is absolutely no doubt about that. I can tell you that, if you talk to the people in those electorates, they will tell you now—and you can do any polling you like, asking: 'Who do you trust with the economy? Who do you trust with the future of your kids?'—that it is not those on the other side they trust. They trust the coalition, and their trust is well founded.

                All of those very fine members, in fact, lobby me all the time about a whole range of issues; I can tell you that. That's what makes them such good members: they're always ensuring that the government understands what the needs of their constituents are. They're always helping the government to understand. It's not only me; I know the whole frontbench here would have heard from those very, very good members. They are constantly saying, 'If we get the economy right, we can get everything else right.' If we don't have a strong economy, we can't make investments in social services, we can't make investments in education and we can't make investments in health. The people in those electorates well understand that, without a strong economy, we cannot make the essential investments for the future of those electorates and, in fact, for the future of our country. That is why they support the economy in the hands of the coalition.

                    In all of those electorates and right across Australia, there's one thing that is so well known: you can't trust Labor! You can't trust what they say. They've come up with another spaghetti mix, a goanna's guts, of promises that they don't understand themselves. They're saying, 'Trust us; it's all going to be all right.' Every other time they have let down the Australian people. They have taken a perfectly good economy that's been left by the coalition, and they have broken it. They have broken it again and again. They have broken the economy, and they have broken their promises. The great thing is that, in all the electorates across Australia, they know that Labor can't be trusted generally. But one thing is absolutely for certain: they cannot be trusted with the economy and the fantastic future that the coalition can bring.
