With the cost-of-living index up by 9.6 per cent for working households in this past year, core inflation almost twice the top of the

                    that is occurring now under this government compared to the 10-year average of the former government. I am surprised that, on the final day, the opposition would again raise wages in their questions on the record that they had, where wages stagnated for a decade, just as productivity did, while the budget got into a mess. That is what happened under your watch. While you try and go out there and say you are the serious economic managers, let's have a look at the actual reality: the worst budget and the worst budget deficit we have ever had; $1 trillion of debt that we inherited with nothing to show for it; wages that had stagnated for a decade. The 10 years you were in government had the lowest productivity increase for 60 years. That is what you achieved. You then come in here and want a conversation with us about wages while, at the same time, you are voting against almost every cost-of-living measure that we have brought into this place. Let us not forget what you did when we wanted to give households support for their energy bills.

                      On top of the new superannuation tax, new taxes on trucking and transport, the government recently allowed ASIC to raise levies on financial advisors from $1,100 to $3,200. This was the first increase in these levies since 2019. During a cost-of-living crisis, why is the Labor Party making it harder for Australians to access quality financial advice?

                       (—) (): My recollection of the funding in that part of ASIC is that it is essentially self-funding, cost-recovered, and that is something that the opposition had supported. So now you are telling me that is not the case, are you? Is that the question that you put to me today? In order to adequately fund and resource ASIC and the financial advisors, fees from financial advice are recouped, as it is through APRA and other national regulators. You are now walking away from that position as well, right? If it is not going to be self-funded, it would come as a cost to the budget, because presumably you would want ASIC appropriately funded in order to regulate the financial system. I would have thought that was something we agreed on. But I am not going to take a lecture from those opposite when they have opposed cheaper medicines, they have opposed energy bill relief and they have opposed extra investment in housing.

                        The average family's mortgage repayments are up approximately $22,000 since Labor came to government and energy bills are up by more than 15 per cent and heading to increases of 25 per cent. Why is the Treasurer telling Australians that they've never had it so good, whilst your policies continue to make a bad situation even worse?

                         The Treasurer has never used those words, so don't verbal the Treasurer. In terms of the cost-of-living measures, it is our priority focus to look at how we can support cost-of-living relief without adding to the inflation problem in the economy. That's why we've invested in cheaper medicines. That's why we've invested in cheaper child care. That's why we're expanding Paid Parental Leave. That's why we're getting wages moving, which was the first question. That's why we're investing in more affordable housing. You voted about 14 times this week to oppose that. That is the action that you took when we look at cost-of-living measures. The stronger safety net; rent assistance, JobSeeker and parenting payment increases; the energy bill relief plan; and fee-free
