            <p>
             I will try to keep this brief. These are our opt-out amendments that I talked about in my speech on the second reading. As we understand it, everybody is allocated a number and people feel concerned that even if they choose not to use their number it is still a number in the system against their name, which they then link to the arguments about it being used later as some sort of overall identity number.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are concerns around that and the preferred approach that has been put to us is that people get the ability to opt out. This does work in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
              UK
             </a>
             . It has a much bigger population than we have and the approach seems to work okay. We thought it would be appropriate to make a similar provision in our legislation and this amendment is about enabling people to opt  out. I understand that the opt-out provision is not used very often in the UK, so it is not as if we are going to get a massive number of people opting out, but it does provide that provision for people who do choose not to be part of that system.

              amendment for healthcare providers because they would need to maintain parallel systems depending on whether or not patients have individual health identifiers. Again, it would reduce the benefits of replacing the existing multiple and overlapping identity systems with a unified system which would reduce administrative costs and the potential for mistakes.

              I understand where the Australian Greens are coming from. They are seeking to have a system which is workable but provides for an opt-out model. But it is important to remember that, while the bill provides health care for all Australians, it in no way compels Australians to use or have an electronic health record. If the unique healthcare identifier system is to be workable, it is essential that Australians can be assured that their identity cannot be confused with someone else’s. On that basis, although I do understand the Greens’ interest in this, we do not support the amendment. But I thought it was important to put that on the record for the Greens.

               I would like to follow this up. I will try to be brief. I do not actually understand the logic of the argument. We have just affirmed that people can choose not to use the identifier. So, particularly with regard to the last argument, that people need this for their identity and to stop mistakes—which is what I took from the minister’s last comments—I do not see why, if you can choose not to use your identifier, providers are not going to need to have a separate system anyway. I am not trying to prolong this, but I do actually want to understand how the system will be different if you choose not to use your identifier, because you can do that, and why—

                  The difficulty is that you would create two classes. There would be one class which would have numbers and one class which would not have numbers, so there would be absent numbers. But you could then have circumstances where people could ask for numbers twice. Confusion could then happen. I know it seems perhaps a little odd at this hour, but what it means is that if everybody has a number then it is unique, but they do not have to, as a consequence, use the electronic health record. That is where the circumstance is like everyone currently having a Medicare number, but in this instance we will have a much clearer identity of each individual through the health identifier system.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  One of the things that has been driving this, I am sure, are the privacy implications. They take that very seriously and that is why they have ensured that the unique health identifier number is there, the privacy is protected, but in addition you do not have to pick up the record as a consequence.

                   There are two things there I want to follow up. One is that not everybody does have a Medicare number. I thought the point of having this system was because not everyone has a Medicare number—there are a number of people on the card. So it is a bit different, and that is one reason why I understood we needed to have this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The point about the double number system—and, again, I am trying really hard not to be obtuse and to understand this—I do not get. I do not get why it is going to cause a problem if people absolutely do not have a number and if they choose not to use their number.

                    I will go back to the two subsets. If you do not have a number then the provider will have to provide some other way to provide the service by providing their own number, a new number or some other number but not a health identifier number, which is separate from the record—which, I am advised, is what happens now. What that would then create is a subset of unique health identifiers, individuals without numbers and then individuals who have accessed health systems with a plethora of numbers. You would then not have a unique health identifier system in place. In terms of having the record, you would then, if you chose, not have an electronic health record. You have to separate the number from the record.

                      What happens now is that when you go to a provider and choose to have a service provided to you, they will allocate a number to you as part of their own record-keeping system. What they will do in future, when this is passed, is allocate you the unique health identifier number as part of the service. You can then choose not to use the health electronic record, but the service provider has still allocated that unique health number.
