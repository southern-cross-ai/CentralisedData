        I refer to the National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No. 1) made under subsection 35(1) of the National Health Security Act 2007.  This instrument removes the requirement for persons handling Tier 1 (highest level biosecurity risk) security-sensitive biological agents (SSBAs) to undergo background checking.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Explanatory Statement notes that this is because the necessary supporting legislation has not been enacted and when that legislation is enacted, the Standards will be amended again to require background checks.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        would appreciate your advice as to when the required legislation will be enacted, whether there is a possibility that persons who are employed to handle SSBAs could subsequently be removed from that role as a result of background checks, and why it is not possible to defer the commencement of this scheme until such legislation has been enacted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 11 September 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination.  Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room

       <p class="italic">
        My Department is proposing to use AusCheck, an agency within the Attorney-General’s portfolio, to provide background checking of persons handling Tier 1 security sensitive biological agents (SSBA). To facilitate that function, the AusCheck Amendment Bill 2009 (the AusCheck Bill), which was introduced in the Autumn 2009 sittings, will amend the AusCheck Act 2007 to enable the AusCheck background checking scheme to include purposes related to Australia’s national security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AusCheck Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee (the Senate Committee) for report in June 2009. As the AusCheck Bill was not passed in the Winter sittings, I made the new Determination to omit the requirement for background checking from the SSBA Standards from 1 July 2009. The effect of this Determination is to defer the commencement of background checking until amending legislation is enacted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In its report on 16 June 2009, the Senate Committee recommended that ‘a clause be inserted into the Bill clarifying that no background checking scheme may be established under either the AusCheck Act nor regulations promulgated under the Act in the absence of another
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Act of Parliament
        </a>
        providing for the establishment of such a scheme.’ Consistent with that recommendation, amendments will be introduced to provide a comprehensive background checking scheme in the principal Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AusCheck Bill will be debated in the Spring sittings and I expect to introduce the NHS Act amendments also in the Spring sittings. Following passage of the AusCheck Bill and the NHS Act amendments, the SSBA background checking scheme will be introduced and include new SSBA Standards, along the lines of the previous Determination, which will require background checking of persons that handle Tier 1 SSBA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Removal of persons as a result of background checks
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently Part 3 of the SSBA Standards requires entities to authorise persons to handle Tier 1 SSBA. An authorised person must be trained in the SSBA legislative requirements and not be excluded from handling SSBA under the NHS Act. On commencement of the SSBA background checking scheme, the SSBA Standards will require authorised persons to undergo and clear background checking.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is possible that a person authorised to handle Tier I SSBA under the current SSBA Standards and who undergoes background checking (when that requirement commences), will not be cleared. Such a person could not continue to be an authorised person to handle Tier 1 SSBA. At the entity’s discretion, such a person could continue to handle Tier 1 SSBA as an ‘approved person’ who is supervised at all times by an authorised person.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commencement of the scheme
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The SSBA Regulatory Scheme commenced on 31 January 2009. The Scheme provides controls on handling SSBA including stringent requirements relating to the notification of the type and location of SSBA in Australia, along with Standards that must be met by entities handling SSBA. The SSBA Standards relate to matters such as the secure handling and movement of SSBA, along with personnel requirements and risk management strategies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Scheme will be further strengthened when background checking of personnel is introduced following passage of the supporting legislative amendments.

        Dear Minister
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 14 September 2009 concerning the National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No. 1) made under subsection 35(1) of the National Health Security Act 2007. This instrument removes the requirement for persons handling Tier 1 security-sensitive biological agents (SSBAs) to undergo background checking.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In your letter, you note the importance of background checks to the operation of the new scheme, and the intention that amendments will be introduced to provide a comprehensive background checking scheme in the principal Act.  The effect of this Determination is to defer the commencement of background checking until that amending legislation is enacted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee has two broad concerns with such an approach. First, given the significance of background checks, how is it possible to implement a scheme for handling security-sensitive biological agents without first undertaking background checks? Would it not be preferable to implement a complete (rather than an incomplete) scheme?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Secondly, could you please provide some further detail as to the likely consequences for a person currently authorised to handle SSBAs, who subsequently fails to satisfy a background check.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 22 October 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Determination. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

        The SSBA Regulatory Scheme

       <p class="italic">
        The November 2006
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        ) Report on the Regulation and Control of Biological Agents noted that there were few controls currently governing the security of biological agents in Australia.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report" rel="nofollow">
         The Report
        </a>
        found that regulation focussed on safety rather than security and that there was a particular need to regulate the secure storage, possession, use and transport of biological agents in order to minimise the bioterrorist risk.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Part 3 of the National Health Security Act 2007 establishes the SSBA Regulatory Scheme in response to the COAG Report. The Scheme was phased-in over an extended period to enable consultation with stakeholders in the development of operational details, procedures and administrative arrangements. The Scheme is underpinned by the following elements:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         establishment of a List of SSBAs;
        </li>
        <li>
         a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register" rel="nofollow">
          National Register
         </a>
         that collects information about the nature and location of SSBAs handled by entities/facilities in Australia;
        </li>
        <li>
         determination of physical, storage, and personnel Standards for entities or facilities handling SSBAs;
        </li>
        <li>
         National Health Security Regulations 2008 that provide further operational details including reporting; and
        </li>
        <li>
         an inspection regime.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Many entities which operate the high containment facilities that handle SSBAs and other dangerous pathogens already have pre-employment checks for personnel who work with these agents. Under the SSBA Standards which came into effect on 1 July 2009 entities handling SSBAs must determine and maintain a list of personnel who are authorised to handle SSBAs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The importance of the proposed background checking scheme is that it will formalise and mandate background checking for all entities that handle Tier 1 SSBAs. Background checking, which will be introduced as a requirement of the SSBA Standards, is one part of the multi layered controls of the Scheme. Given that other important elements of the Scheme have been operational since January 2009, I am confident that when background checking is introduced, an additional layer of control will further enhance the security of the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consequences for authorised persons who fail a background check
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You request further detail on the likely consequences for a person who fails a background check. Such a person would not be legally able to handle Tier 1 SSBAs in an unsupervised context. However, at the entity’s discretion, such a person could continue to handle Tier 1 SSBAs, providing they are supervised at all times under line of sight by an authorised person.

        In your response you advise that many entities already have pre-employment checks for personnel who work with SSBA agents.  The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether those checks are of the same nature as the background checks under the SSBA Scheme.

        The Committee would also appreciate further information on the consequences for persons who fail a background check.  You advise that ‘at the entity’s discretion’ a person could continue to work under line of sight supervision. What is not clear is when this discretion might be exercised, and what happens if such supervision is not available.

        Dear Senator Wortley
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you f/or your letter of 29 October 2009 requesting further information in relation to the National Health Security (SSBA Standards) Amendment Determination 2009 (No. 1) (the Amendment Determination).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As you are aware, this determination removed, for the time being, the requirement for background checking of persons handling Tier I Security Sensitive Biological Agents (SSBAs) or related sensitive information. The Amendment Determination was made as supporting legislation to enable the operation of the background checking scheme for the SSBA Regulatory Scheme has not as yet been enacted. Without this determination, it would not be possible for entities to comply with the SSBA Standards and they would inadvertently be committing an offence under the National Health Security Act 2007 (the NHS Act).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I note that the AusCheck Amendment Bill 2009 is currently being considered by Parliament, and that I will shortly be introducing a bill to amend the NHS Act, that will enable the operation of the background checking scheme for the SSBA Regulatory Scheme. Should these amendments be enacted, I would then intend to issue a determination reinstating the requirement for background checking of persons handling SSBAs or related sensitive information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Until such time as those amendments are enacted, it remains important for the Amendment Determination to remain in place, so that it is possible for entities to comply with the SSBA Standards and the NHS Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In this context, I provide the following information in response to your questions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Pre-employment checks
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The pre-employment checks conducted by entities generally consist of criminal history checks. Should the relevant legislation be passed, the proposed SSBA background checks will assess a person’s criminal history against a set of disqualifying offences for the SSBA Regulatory Scheme, and include an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        politically motivated violence check. The proposed SSBA disqualifying offences would be framed to ensure that very serious offences that attract a term of imprisonment of at least 12 months are included. Any such offences would also be detected by pre-employment criminal history checks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Consequences for people who fail a background check
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As previously indicated, a person who fails a background check could only continue to handle Tier I SSBAs as an ‘approved person’ if they are supervised at all times and under line of sight by an authorised person. If such supervision is not available, a person who has failed a background check would be unable to work with SSBAs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An entity has limited discretion to enable a person who may have failed a background check to handle SSBAs, as the SSBA Standards set requirements on personnel security with the objective that ‘the entity must ensure personnel management systems are in place to implement and manage biosecurity for SSBAs and related sensitive information.’ To achieve that objective, the Standards require that authorised persons have been trained in the requirements of the NHS Act, the NHS Regulations and the Standards. The inspection regime will monitor an entity’s compliance with the SSBA Standards. An entity’s discretion to approve a person to handle or access SSBAs will be considered in the context of the objective of this Standard and other relevant requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These mechanisms will help ensure that the SSBAs continue to be handled securely to support the health and safety of all Australians.
