         I thank Senator Moore for her question and for her continued support for renewable energy in this country, support which is also reflected in the government’s election commitment of increasing the renewable energy target to 20 per cent by 2020, something which was never done whilst those opposite were in government and was never matched by them in the election campaign. Senators may be aware that this year the government sought
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         agreement to provide assistance under the renewable energy target to those industries comprised of activities which are emissions intensive and trade exposed, as defined under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
          CPRS
         </a>
         legislation. We made that decision because we had been in close dialogue and consultation with industries, a number of whom put to us that we needed to consider the cumulative cost of both the renewable energy target and the carbon price which will be delivered through the CPRS.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government remains committed to assisting emissions-intensive trade exposed firms to help manage the cumulative costs of the CPRS and the renewable energy target once both pieces of legislation are passed. It is the case that, as a result of the division on the other side of the chamber and the inability of the coalition to support action on climate change, the government has had to look to plan B—a less beneficial alternative, but an alternative which we think is necessary—in order to ensure that solar providers, wind companies, wave companies and the other providers of renewable energy in this country are provided with the certainty that is required until such time as the coalition sort out their internal squabble on the CPRS. The government will not let the future of renewable energy in this country be held hostage to the divisions in the coalition on the issue of climate change. So, I have announced our decision to set aside the link between the renewable energy target and—

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer and I continue. Isn’t it the case that even if we increase Australia’s renewable energy by four times, our own carbon pollution will keep increasing so that it will be about 20 per cent higher in 2020 than it was in 2000? Given this is a fact, how does the Rudd government plan to turn around this continuing growth in Australia’s carbon pollution?

          <p>
           Senator Moore raises a very important point. Those who want to try and gain some environmental credentials by supporting someone else’s election commitment in this place will need to deal with this hard fact: even with the renewable energy target in place Australia’s contribution to climate change will continue to worsen. Australia’s carbon pollution will continue to rise, as Senator Moore alluded to, to 120 per cent of 2000 levels by 2020. That is, we will have 120 per cent of our 2000 emissions by 2020, so we will continue to contribute increasingly to climate change.
          </p>
          <p>
           What we would like the Senate to consider is this: unless we face the hard truth and legislate a cap on carbon pollution the fact is that Australia’s carbon pollution will continue to rise, Australia’s emissions will continue to rise and Australia’s contribution to climate change will—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister inform the Senate of the challenges Australia faces in trying to reduce our carbon pollution? With the community continuing to call for action on climate change, what assurance can the minister provide about our government’s intentions to reduce carbon pollution?

             Well, as we have previously indicated in this place, we are committed to action on climate change. Australians have been calling for action for many years. Australians expect this government to deliver on its election commitment just as, I suggest, they expect those opposite to overcome their internal divisions and deal with this issue. It is unfortunate that the climate change sceptics opposite continue to prevail over Mr Turnbull. It seems that too many in the coalition continue to deny the need for action on climate change. Even
