         thank 'Brigadier' Reynolds for the question and acknowledge her long and distinguished service to the ADF. As announced by the minister and the Prime Minister today, the government is committed to increasing the ADF pay offer to two per cent per annum over the life of the agreement with effect from the next pay day. Today's decision follows considerable consultation and representations from the defence community. Over the decade from 2004 to 2013, annual ADF pay increases have totalled 38 per cent while annual median wage increases for Commonwealth public servants totalled 42 per cent compared to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
          CPI
         </a>
         , totalling 28 per cent. In other words, public servants have done around four per cent better than members of the ADF.
        </p>
        <p>
         ADF personnel fell behind the Commonwealth public servants under the previous Labor government. In the years 2008 to 2013, annual ADF remuneration increases totalled 21 per cent while
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">
          APS
         </a>
         increases totalled 26 per cent. Further, defence as a whole suffered. The government now needs to find an additional $16,000 million just to replace what Labor stripped out of defence in its six years of government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Increasing ADF pay by two per cent per annum will increase the likelihood that, going forward, ADF members do better than inflation and politicians. Salary is, of course, only one important component. ADF personnel also receive competency-based allowances, free medical and dental treatment, subsidised housing and a range of other benefits. This increase allows the ADF to catch-up with the cuts they suffered under Labor.

              Senator Reynolds is right to ask for such a comparison because, as we speak, parliamentarian's pay is frozen. There will be no increase in 2014-15. Evidence from the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Public Service Commission
              </a>
              at Senate estimates last week noted that recent government pay offers should be seen in the context of falling inflation. Inflation for the year to December 2014 was 1.7 per cent with the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
               RBA
              </a>
              forecasting inflation to June this year of 1.25 per cent, while the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" rel="nofollow">
               National Australia Bank
              </a>
              is forecasting a rate to December 2015 of only 1.2 per cent. If this is the case, ADF members who were awarded a 1.5 per cent increase last November, and will get further increases, would already be keeping level with inflation for these years. The two per cent pay rise is therefore likely to be better than inflation.
