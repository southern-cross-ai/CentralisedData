        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. I refer the minister to his public comments regarding the James Ashby allegations against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker of the House of Representatives
        </a>
        , Mr Peter Slipper. I remind the minister of his tweet of 5 May 2012 which said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Ashby seems more rehearsed than a kabuki actor.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also refer the minister to the recent reports of appalling, derogatory and misogynistic text messages sent by Mr Slipper to Mr Ashby. Given that the Commonwealth has now settled with Mr Ashby for a sum of $50,000, does the minister stand by his previous public comments on this matter and does he believe that Mr Slipper is now an international embarrassment?

            Therefore, I stand absolutely by my comments that this matter should have gone straight to court and not been filtered through the political process.
           </p>
           <p>
            The second point I would make is this—and if the opposition regarded the comments that emerged in the court as repellent in their attitude towards women as we do on this side of the House, they would join me in giving an unqualified condemnation of those comments—that I am advised the government has entered into a deed with Mr Ashby which provides releases to the Commonwealth and gives effect to the settlement reached. The government takes sexual harassment in the workplace very seriously. That is the very reason that these matters belonged in the court from the first place, and did not belong—

                   Order! Just wait a minute: it is improper to debate the matter across the chamber. You are quite entitled to make a point of order, and if someone wishes to take another point of order based on the matter before the chair that is an entitlement that exists. So I discourage people from debating it across the chamber.

                       , I would urge you to rule that there is no point of order. Despite the question probably being out of order in the sense that it did not refer to the minister's ministerial responsibilities, he has been giving a comprehensive and fulsome answer. There is no point of order.

                         I want to inform the Senate that mediation was held with all parties last week. I am advised that the government's hope with this was that this process would bring about settlement between all parties. Unfortunately, the mediation was unable to settle the matter between Mr Ashby and Mr Slipper. The terms of the settlement are public, and they include an express provision that the Commonwealth does not accept liability.

I cannot speak for other senators or members of the House of Representatives.
