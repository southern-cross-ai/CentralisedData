            , on a point of order, I know that Senator Conroy seeks to make light of this matter but it is a serious question. It goes to the integrity of his declarations and his public statements. I ask you on this particular occasion, given its sensitivity, to be very strict in your enforcement of the direct relevance requirement.

                    , I have a point of order on direct relevance. Since you overruled the last point of order, the minister has done nothing but attack the opposition. Nothing but attack the opposition. Nothing he said is directly or indirectly relevant to the question. He was merely asked, not in a belligerent way, to reconcile two apparently inconsistent statements. He has not addressed that issue, I would submit with respect, at all. But he certainly has not addressed it since you overruled the last point of order.

Can the minister provide an explanation, other than his haste and sloppiness, as to why his undated disclosure of benefits received from Mr Obeid was addressed and sent to the House of Representatives Registrar of Members' Interests rather than the Registrar of Senators' Interests? Will he now make a full and proper disclosure to the Senate?
