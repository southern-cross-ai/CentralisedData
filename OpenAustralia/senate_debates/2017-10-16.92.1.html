        My question is to the Acting Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Cash. Can the minister update the Senate on what the Turnbull government is doing to assist Australia's manufacturing businesses as they transition?

         Thank you, Senator Fawcett, and yes, I can. This is a pivotal time for Australian industry and, in particular, Australian manufacturing. The Turnbull government has the policies to help workers in transition and to assist our manufacturers to seek lucrative markets both here domestically and overseas. For example, the government is ensuring that those affected by the closure of Holden continue to receive assistance as they transfer into new industries. Our focus is on the industries of the future. This is underpinned by our $238 million Industry Growth Centres initiative, focusing on industries where Australia has a demonstrated competitive advantage to create new jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also supporting businesses' transition, through our $155 million growth fund, following the closure of the automotive manufacturers, and we have extended this assistance with a further $100 million in this year's budget. We are also supporting businesses through our $400 million
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs'_Program" rel="nofollow">
          Entrepreneurs' Program
         </a>
         , which gives them the advice and support they need to improve their competitiveness and productivity and to seek growth opportunities. We've commenced a $90 billion naval shipbuilding program. We also have a half-a-billion-dollar upgrade of the Osborne shipbuilding facility in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . This will employ 600 people at its peak. We are building an $8.4 billion inland rail line, which will bring our regional producers and communities closer to markets. The government's support for manufacturing industry is a landmark investment in our nation, our industries and our communities.

            Thank you, Senator Fawcett. The government has announced the $100 million advanced manufacturing fund in the last budget. We're working in collaboration with businesses in Victoria and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            to help them move into new markets. This week, I will announce nearly $30 million in grants to 20 businesses in Victoria and South Australia. These grants will leverage an additional $89 million from successful applicants. This is, in total, a $119 million investment in manufacturing for South Australia and Victoria. I will shortly be opening an additional grant round to give industries the best opportunity to compete, to grow and to prosper. This is real money being invested in manufacturing in Victoria and South Australia.

              We recognise that for some of the workers at Holden and Toyota this is an uncertain time. My message to those workers is that you will continue to be supported after the closures. We will work with you so that you have the necessary skills to get into new jobs. Holden advises that 75 per cent of Holden workers have found new jobs or have retired and that another 10 per cent are entering full-time study. Every Holden worker has had access to transition services and up to $3,000 in approved training. Let's remember that the industry will retain over 2,000 engineers, designers and technicians maintaining Australia's world-class automotive design and engineering capability.
