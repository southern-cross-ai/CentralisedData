        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and

         Water Resources
        </a>
        , Senator Abetz. I refer to the study by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation,
        <i>

         </a>
         and south east Queensland
        </i>
        , which was commissioned by the National Water Commission at the request of the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. Is the minister aware that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMEC" rel="nofollow">
         SMEC
        </a>
        study did not consider the impact of climate change, reduced rainfall run-off and drought? Is the minister aware that these things were not included in the terms of reference from the government? Can the minister outline why climate change and reduced rainfall run-off were not considered an essential part of the terms of reference for this study?

         I have had a quick look through the briefing folder that I have been supplied by the minister. I do not seem to have a relevant brief on that, so what I will do is take that matter on notice.

           , there is further information I require and questions I would like the minister to answer. Minister, do you agree that the failure to consider climate change and reduced run-off means that the study is flawed? Will the government ask
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMEC" rel="nofollow">
            SMEC
           </a>
           to revisit the report, taking into account climate change and reduced run-off? Was the failure to include climate change in the terms of reference during the period when the government was still in its climate-sceptic phase?

            We have never been sceptical about climate change; it has existed from day one. I have got news for the Greens: climate has been with us since day one of creation. It is quite clear that Senator Siewert has in fact already given herself an answer to the original question, which was disclosed in her supplementary question.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
             Can I
            </a>
            simply remind Senator Siewert and those listening that we as a government established a world-first

            in 1998. Why do you think we did that—because we did not think climate change was an issue? Of course not. We did it because we were genuinely concerned, and we have had a program of ensuring that we engage in this debate on a sensible, slow and rational basis. That is why—
