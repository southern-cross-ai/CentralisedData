        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) on 19 February 2020, a man murdered his ex-wife, Ms Hannah Clarke, and their three children by dousing their car with petrol and setting it alight,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) Ms Clarke was the 8th woman to be killed by violence since the start of 2020,

       <p class="italic">
        (iii) many initial media reports of the crime sought to minimise her

        ex-husband's role or to portray him as a "loving father pushed too far",

        report on 17 February 2020 regarding the conviction of an athletics coach at St Kevin's for grooming a student, prominent commentators also sought to minimise the offence and its consequences,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) inaccurate and biased reporting of violence against women and children allows a culture of violence and entitlement to perpetuate,

        </a>
        for reporting of sexual, domestic and family violence make clear that reports should emphasise the role of the perpetrator and avoid any suggestion of culpability on the part of the victim or survivor – for example, the various guidelines state:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (A) "Words matter: Publications should be mindful of the language they use and try to avoid terms that tend to trivialise, demean or inadvertently excuse family violence",
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (B) "Violence is never acceptable: The perpetrator is always solely responsible for a violent situation – Avoid using language or framing the story in a way that suggests the survivor of violence was in any way to blame for what happened to him or her", and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (C) "Domestic violence is sometimes reported with headlines like 'Woman assaulted', or with stories that focus only on what happened to the survivor – This can suggest that violence is something that 'just happens' to women – Emphasise that someone perpetrated this violence, and that it was a crime"; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vii) current guidelines are advisory only and are not part of the enforceable standards against which complaints can be assessed; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) calls on all reporters, commentators and media outlets to comply with guidelines for reporting on sexual, domestic and family violence.

                We will support this motion. Comments like those expressed by Ms Arndt are abhorrent and unacceptable. There are never any excuses or justifications for family violence or the evil that Hannah Clarke and her children experienced. The government does not make decisions to award or cancel honours in the Order of Australia, and government senators respect the independence and confidentiality of the deliberations of the Council for the Order of Australia in making recommendations to the Governor-General. In respecting the independence of the council, it's important that this motion is not seen as directing the Council of the Order of Australia, whose independent deliberations must be respected.

                   and her defence of Queensland Detective Inspector Mark Thompson. The circumstances that emergency services respondents faced that day are unprecedented. Detective Inspector Mark Thompson faced a media pack like no other. His comments were unscripted as he tried to accommodate both the media and the public's heartfelt disbelief of the calculating, callous murder-suicide of Hannah Clarke and her three children by her former husband, Rowan Baxter. It is the role of the police to investigate this unconscionable incident, and that may very well include triggers that led to the event on 19 February. No right-thinking person condones the actions of domestic violence, and this was one of the country's worst. Bettina Arndt has the right to support the role of police and, in particular, Detective Inspector Mark Thompson—
