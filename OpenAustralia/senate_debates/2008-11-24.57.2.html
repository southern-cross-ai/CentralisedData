        (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and the Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 2) 2008-2009 are supplementary annual appropriation bills which request legislative authority for further expenses to be incurred in 2008-2009 in relation to the Economic Security Strategy.  The bills allow funds to be made available to departments, thereby ensuring implementation of the programs relating to the Economic Security Strategy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further annual appropriation bills are required, in particular, to fund the expansion of the First Home Owners Grants scheme and additional employment training places as announced on 14 October 2008.  The additional funding required exceeds what is currently available to the departments and from the Advance to the

        As announced, payments are to be made to pensioners, seniors, people with disability, carers, veterans and families by Centrelink and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs in the fortnight commencing 8 December 2008.  Enactment of the legislation by 5 December 2008 will meet the Centrelink system release date of 6 December 2008.  That system release is essential to making the payments on time and delivering this immediate financial support to pensioners, seniors, carers and families during the global financial crisis.

        If timely passage is not granted to the supplementary appropriation bills, payments to the
