         I thank Senator Hume very much for her question. The Morrison government believes that, if you want work, you should be able to access it. As we're now living healthier and longer lives, active ageing presents great opportunities for older Australians to keep participating in the workforce and to better prepare for a sustainable future and a fulfilling retirement. Aside from the obvious financial benefits that that brings, it also works to help improve health outcomes and contribute to self-esteem and has significant social and emotional benefitsâ€”and we all see those in our communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why the government is helping to support mature-age workers who want to work to find and retain employment through a number of programs. For instance, in an Australian first, we are providing comprehensive intensive support to mature-age jobseekers through the Career Transition Assistance program trial, which builds participants' competitiveness in the local jobs market. That program will be rolled out nationally from next year. We're also providing funding for upskilling opportunities for mature-aged workers who are identified as being at risk through the Skills and Training Incentive. We're expanding the Entrepreneurship Facilitators program to 20 additional locations to encourage entrepreneurship and self-employment amongst mature-age Australians. And we're providing Restart wage subsidies up to $10,000 to encourage business to hire and retain eligible mature-age employees. This is, of course, in addition to the many other measures contained in the government's More Choices for a Longer Life Package, which was announced in the most recent budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our Australian economy benefits from the experience, skills and work ethic of mature-age workers, just as our communities and our families benefit from their contributions more broadly

            That's a very good supplementary question because, as I alluded to in my previous answer, the government is making a strong investment through the More Choices for a Longer Life Package, which we announced in the 2018-19 budget, to help people prepare for a long life which is independent, healthy and connected, and which enables them to work for longer as they wish.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under the More Choices for a Longer Life Package we are investing $189.7 million in a range of jobs and skills measures to help mature-age Australians to find the right job, to stay in the workplace, to have flexibility in their later worker years and, importantly, to retire with security. This action and the job growth flowing from this government's stewardship of the economy has extended to the employment of mature workers. There was an increase of 73,000 mature-age workers in the workforce over the past 12 months. The participation rate also increased over the past 12 months to sit at almost 70 per cent, which was above the overall participation rate recorded for all persons, at 65.7 per cent. It's part of more than a million jobs created by this government.

              <p>
               Unfortunately I am, because the reckless high-taxing approach that those opposite would adopt, which would see them with their hands in the pockets of older Australians, will actually impact on them with $200 billion worth of taxes. They want to hike taxes on close to one million small businesses, just for example. Can you imagine how hard that will hit Australia's job market? Businesses spending more on taxes means they have less to spend on workers. The approach of those opposite is just further evidence that they can't be trusted to run the country's economy or to help older Australians find and retain employment.
              </p>
              <p>
               In contrast to those opposite, the Morrison government is focused on delivering those jobs. As last week's labour force figures show, there are more Australians in work than ever before and more Australians in full-time work than ever before. It's clear that only this government, the Morrison government, has a plan to deliver more jobs for all Australians, including older Australians.
