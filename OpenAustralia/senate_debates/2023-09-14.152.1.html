        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. The first shipment of raw sugar from Australia to the United Kingdom under a new bilateral free trade agreement arrived in London last week. Before the United Kingdom joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        in 1973, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        was a major market for Australian sugar. But after the UK joined the EU, Australian sugar exports were crushed because of incredibly high import tariffs. Last week's arrival of the 33,000-metric-tonne sugar shipment marks the reopening of a valuable market for Australian sugar producers and exporters. Minister, would you outline what action the Albanese government has taken to pave the way for the first shipment of Australian sugar to the UK in 50 years?

         Yes, we finalised it. Last week, Australian canegrowers witnessed the first shipment of raw sugar arriving in the UK in over 50 years. Now, consumers across the UK will be celebrating the return of Australian-grown sugar to their supermarket shelves. Their scones with jam will be just a little bit sweeter—

             Some of those Queenslanders will be monarchists. Prior to the Albanese government implementing Australia's trade agreement with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
              UK
             </a>
             , Australian sugar exports faced extremely high import tariffs. The former coalition government let the industry down by failing to implement an agreement with the United Kingdom, but industry could rely on the Albanese government to clean up the mess that we had been left, and we didn't let them down. We prioritised the trade deal with our close trading partner and friend the United Kingdom. The first shipment of tariff-free sugar to the UK market last week is proof that the trade agreement is delivering real, practical benefits for Australian farmers and workers like those heralding from the great state of Queensland and represented by the Queensland Cane Growers Organisation, who I met with yesterday. But the Senate can be assured that the Australian sugar industry isn't the only industry—

                , for your first supplementary question. Yes, I can provide that information to you, because our trade deal with the United Kingdom is a gold-standard free trade agreement. It delivers for Australian farmers, businesses and workers by removing import tariffs on over 99 per cent of our $10 billion two-way trade in goods with the United Kingdom. The removal of these border taxes increases opportunities for Australian exports of not only sugar but also beef, sheep meat, wine, honey, dairy and manufactured products like auto parts, electrical equipment and cosmetic products. The agreement also supports our services exporters by making it easier for Australian workers to provide services into the

                   market through a range of export services. Examples of support for Australian exporters to make the most of the UK free trade agreement include free, practical assistance from the Austrade TradeStart network to develop export strategies and find valuable contacts in the United Kingdom, including through business missions and trade shows. The financial assistance through the Export Market Development Grants program helps eligible Australian businesses to get a foothold in the United Kingdom market. There are opportunities to participate in the London Landing Pad, where innovative Australian technology companies can scale up into the UK market. These are some of the ways that the Albanese government is helping exporters.
