         Digital Economy

        , Senator Conroy. Can the minister specifically explain how the $250 million rebate for commercial television broadcasters—that is, 33 per cent in 2010 and 50 per cent in 2011—was arrived at? Specifically, are the rebate figures directly related to local content costs incurred by those networks?

         The government will protect Australian content on commercial television by offering licence fee rebates to broadcasters in 2010 and 2011. A rebate of 33 per cent will apply to licence fees payable on revenue earned the period 1 January to 31 December 2010 and a rebate of 50 per cent will apply to licence fees payable on revenue earned in the period 1 January to 31 December 2011. The rebates are just one part of a package of measures to address the structural changes facing free-to-air television at a time when media consumption habits are changing because of the rising use of the internet and as we make the switch to digital television. We make no apology for moving to protect Australian content in this environment. In the
         <i>
          Digital dividend
         </i>
         green paper, released in January, the government indicated its intention to clear 126 megahertz of spectrum currently used by free-to-air broadcasters for new services. This is a significant microeconomic reform.

            Mr President

           . What we now have is a rephrasing of the question from the questioner. The minister has been specifically answering the question dealing with both the licence fee rebate and the issue about rebates for commercial broadcasters. The minister has been specifically dealing with the question that has been asked. But, of course, what we now have from the opposition is a rephrasing of the question with the question now put in the frame: will you answer yes or no? I ask, Mr President, respectfully, that you rule that out of order, because that part was not the original question and is a rephrasing of the original question.

             Thank you. This, as I said, is a significant microeconomic reform and, more importantly, one that those opposite when in government had the chance to deliver and failed to deliver. New communications services enabled by the spectrum release have the potential to significantly boost productivity. Moreover, the sale of this spectrum will generate substantial revenue for the Commonwealth. The government’s decision to offer a temporary rebate on licence fees recognises the unique pressures facing the free-to-air sector. Analysts have recognised that free-to-air television is undergoing a significant structural decline. I can go no further than quote Mr Rupert Murdoch, who told a
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp" rel="nofollow">

               shareholder meeting late last year that broadcast stations ‘can no longer be supported solely by advertising revenues’. Respected analyst Roger Colman noted last week:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Not only did profitability decline by half for most of the

               networks in fiscal ‘09, but more importantly, their relative share of advertising … has fallen 33 per cent since 2005.

              <p>
               In the face of this structural change and the arrival of the converged media environment, it is imperative that the government protects Australian content. Local content production is expensive. It costs around $800,000 to produce an hour of
