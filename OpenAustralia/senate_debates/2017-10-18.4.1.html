           Without going through the answer that I gave to a previous question, the decision about the specifics of the office accommodation are obviously a matter for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIC" rel="nofollow">
            RIC
           </a>
           board; the decision to locate the RIC in Orange was a decision of government. The decision of government was based on a number of criteria, which I talked about in the answer to a question yesterday: the importance of Orange as an agricultural hub which is well serviced by transport links, particularly from Canberra and Sydney; the opportunities for growth in that area; and the fact that it also meets the existing strong commitment by this government to establish hubs in rural and regional areas of Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition to that, obviously we had discussions with other operations in Orange to assure ourselves that this was a suitable place for this corporation to go. Departmental officers, I understand, have met with stakeholders in Orange to discuss the establishment of the RIC in that city, that regional location. The meetings were held with a number of organisations, including the

            Yesterday, Minister, you stated that you were not aware of any discussions the minister or his department is having about outsourcing functions of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIC" rel="nofollow">
             RIC
            </a>
            . At the public hearing of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
             Select Committee
            </a>
            on Regional Development and Decentralisation in Bendigo on 9 October 2017, Ms Gartmann, the managing director and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
             CEO
            </a>

             Rural Bank
            </a>
            , gave evidence in response to the following questions:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            â€¦ can you let us know if there's been any consultation with rural finance about the Regional Investment Corporation? Has anyone reached out to you about what's worked and what hasn't worked? Going forward, are you concerned at all about this federal organisation coming in and taking core business?
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms Gartmann replied:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            There certainly has been a large amount and a continuing number of engagements between the Commonwealth agencies and Rural Finance Corporation/
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">
             Bendigo Bank
            </a>
            representatives to discuss what is currently being executed in Victoria in partnership with the Victorian government and to explore areas to strengthen and improve the delivery of the government concessional lending and drought-and-disaster support. That continues to take place. Certainly we're always open to supporting a national approach and collaborating and partnering in whatever model is finalised going forward as of July next year.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            As was outlined by Marnie, the balancing act is having some efficiency by coordination from a central, national point as opposed to the current delivery by the states and territories. It is the efficiency gained by having one system as opposed to multiple and balancing that out with an entity that is then further removed from the customer base that it is there to support and serve by having a national entity as opposed to those based in states and across the regions. That balance is yet to be worked out. We've still got a number of months to go before that is supposed to be up and running on 1 July, and we will certainly continue to share the experiences of Rural Finance Corporation with the relevant individuals and agencies to try to create a model that will serve and support all the farmers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms Gartmann went on to say:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The offset accounts. They have traditionally not been available to agricultural businesses. But it is a common practice in residential lending. Legislative changes last year at a federal level were passed and that allowed the farm management deposit offset account to be created, which allows farmers to offset funds held in a farm management deposit account against eligible variable rate term lending, thereby reducing their farm lending costs. Rural Bank is the only bank in market offering that at the moment. But those sorts of legislative changes can demonstrate that it leads to positive business and funding changes for an industry, when done and supported by the private sector.
           </p>
           <p>
            During a break, Ms Gartmann said that Bendigo Bank/Rural Finance was hoping to be able to tender for RIC work, which would be a front, but Bendigo Bank would continue to do the work. Ms Gartmann said they were in discussions with the department about a tender process.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that we know there have been discussions about outsourcing functions of the RIC, can the minister provide detail to the Senate about any other discussions? Is the minister aware that the department is having discussions with agencies that are currently delivering concessional loans? Has any work been undertaken regarding the cost these possible arrangements may incur? Will the RIC be regulated in a similar fashion to other financial banking institutions with regard to receivers, evaluators, lenders and who can provide advice to farm businesses seeking a loan?

             Thank you, Senator Brown. I will do my very best to answer the myriad of questions that you asked in that one long question. As I said to you yesterday, I wasn't aware of the consultations, but overnight I took it upon myself to avail myself of information relating to the consultation process that has been undertaken to date, particularly in relation to the areas that you were talking about: outsourcing and rural financial counselling services.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can advise you that, in the period from 9 July to 10 August this year, the department engaged with a number of representatives of the banking sector and current concessional loan delivery agencies to gain a greater understanding of the market as well as the risks and opportunities in the service delivery area. As part of this process, they also met with a number of agencies that relate to the delivery of these financial assets to the community. They included the

            </p>
            <p>
             In relation to the determination about the specifics of the operation, you asked about outsourcing and the opportunity for existing providers to be able to work as service providers and service delivery providers for the Regional Investment Corporation. Whilst some preliminary discussions have occurred around the broader issues of the delivery of the services of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIC" rel="nofollow">
              RIC
             </a>
             , the government believes it is appropriate that the details of that are a matter for the RIC board, once it is established, and so the detailed answers to the questions that you have asked are not available at this stage. However, I think it is reasonable to say that the RIC board will be given a level of scope to be able to make sure that they are delivering the services to the farming community of Australia in the most efficient and effective way. If they determine that that is using service providers that are currently in the marketplace, and I am sure they will, then that is obviously a matter of which they are able to avail themselves.

                 At the moment, the department is doing a level of preparatory work so that when the board is appointed they have as much information available as possible on which to base their decisions. Of course, the board is entirely entitled to go and seek its own information, or additional information, so I suppose you could just refer to it as somewhat of an incoming briefâ€”so that they have information before them. Obviously, anything that the board may choose to do has to be within the terms of the operating mandate.

                  â€”if they were successful in any tenderâ€”would be running the work of the RIC. She has indicatedâ€”just because you look confused, Ministerâ€”that they were hoping to be able to tender for RIC work and the RIC would be a front but the Bendigo Bank would continue to do to the work.

                  <p>
                   No, I'm not confused. First of all, referring to the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIC" rel="nofollow">
                    RIC
                   </a>
                   as a front, I think, is probably a very misleading way to be describing it. Certainly, the opportunity exists for service providers to be able to provide services to the RIC, like any other outsourcing of service delivery that were to occur within a statutory organisation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   However, as I stated before, the decisions about the operation, particularly about outsourcing and the operation and delivery of the assets of the RIC, are a matter for the incoming RIC board. So, apart from being able to say to you, Senator Brown, that the opportunity exists for outsourcing to occur, it would be entirely inappropriate for me to be giving direction to the RIC board about what they should or should not be outsourcing. Suffice to say, powers and opportunities exist for the RIC to do that under the terms of its operating mandate. I'm not sure I can give you any more information than that.

                      On the issue of the operating mandate, we have grave concerns with this bill because of the power that it gives the minister without parliamentary oversight and, in fact, without cabinet oversight. You have just stated that the operating mandate is in preparation, but is it correct that that operating mandate isn't a disallowable instrument?

                         Obviously, the operating mandate is the key vehicle where the government will set out its expectations for the corporation. Whilst the express exemption exists for directions from ministers to corporate Commonwealth entities, the bill provides that the operating mandate is a legislative instrument and must be tabled in the parliament. This gives the parliament a level of oversight. Given the nature and the significance of the potential directions, that is fair and reasonable. It is not proposed for it to be a disallowable instrument. We believe that this is appropriate as it deals with matters over which the executive should retain control. As I said to Senator Brown yesterday when we were discussing the structure of this proposed organisation, the set-up of the

                            We've been asked to pass this legislationâ€”legislation that Labor, the opposition, believes does not have sufficient transparency or parliamentary oversight. So we're here in this committee stage to try to get some answers to allow some of that transparency, not only for the senators and the parliament but for those in the community who are very interested in this piece of legislation. So far we haven't really been able to get any answers to be able to alleviate any concerns that the opposition may have. So I ask the minister whether she can elaborate on her answer.

                             Thank you, Senator Brown. I did go to this point to some degree yesterday when I was explaining that this entity is required to comply. With its governance and regulation arrangements in relation to the PGPA, it is required to meet those regulations. But, in relation to its lending capacity and the regulations around lending, because we're lending to the states, we obviously have to meet all the regulations that would be expected of loans, particularly things like debt mediation et cetera. They would have to comply with the regulations of the respective states in which the loans are occurring, as well. There is a series of statutory requirements and regulations that exist as they would exist with any other statutory organisation of a similar type. But, equally, the actions in terms of loans for drought and debt financing would be subject to the regulations as they exist in the states.

Can you confirm whether it is compulsory for the operating mandate to be considered by cabinet or whether it is, potentially, just the minister who has complete say over what is in the operating mandate?

                                         We're probably getting to a level of detail regarding the operation of cabinet. Obviously ministers have to operate within the conditions that are placed on them by the cabinet. However, in relation to the rolling out of a new type of loan or a new type of facility, obviously the states would have a say, because we can't roll out a facility in their state without their consent.

                                         There are a number of checks and balances that occur through this process. Whilst you make it sound like the minister just makes a decision, there is a series of processes that are already in place around the governance, operation and accountability of the organisation through which this is being undertakenâ€”the processes that currently exist in relation to the operation of ministers, their requirements and obligations under the cabinet process and through the relationship that the federal government has with state governments through existing arrangements and through the requirement of the government to comply with the regulations and requirements of the states in which these activities are occurring.

                                               Currently we are required to work with the states. Under current arrangements, for any new class of loan that is required to be rolled out, a formal process of consultation with the states is required to occur. One of the underlying reasons for the establishment of this particular organisation and the purposing of it to roll out these loans and any new loans is so that we can have a more streamlined, effective and efficient way of getting the loans. Into the future, it would be through discussions between the ministers and the board, because the ministers are required to consult with the

However, in the future, once that direction has been given, following that consultation with the board, the capacity to roll out those loans will not require a formal mechanism. However, obviously, we will continue to consult with the states about the delivery of any assistance to their jurisdictions.

                                                Just clarifying: with the consultation with the states, you're saying that there's a formal process and then there's consultation with the board, but, after that, the ministers have the final power to determine that a new class of loan would be rolled out? Essentially, the power to make that determination rests entirely with the ministers?

                                                 I'm not quite sure what the difference in your question is, but my advice is that there is no formal mechanism that requires us to consult with the states. However, I would say that I presided over the last ag minister's ministerial council and I've been at all ag minister ministerial councils since this particular organisation has been on the table as a proposed method by which to roll out future loans to the states. It has the overwhelming support of the states in its current proposed structure, so the states are quite happy with the way this is progressing. I'm not quite sure what you're actually asking outside of that.

                                                  I'm clarifying. There is no formal mechanism of consultation with the states, so, essentially, we have to trust the government that it's going to be doing it appropriately. There is the requirement, however, of the minister to consult with the board, but I just want to clarify that, at the end of the day, the power to decide that a new class of loan or a particular type of loan is going to be rolled out in a particular area rests solely with the ministers.

As you might be aware, the process that currently exists, which would continue, requires the state governments to be the ones that actually put forward the proposals in the first place. So it's a completely different process. Obviously, once we've received the applications from the states and they go through a process of evaluation in exactly the same way as they currently go through a process of arm's-length, independent evaluation, the recommendation would go back to the

                                                      Just to clarify: that's for the water infrastructure loans.

What's the process, however, for the farm business loans?

Obviously that requires, first of all, that the project has come forward with the authority, consent and request of the state or territory in which the piece of infrastructure is to be constructed. The corporation then has to go through a rigorous process of assessment and make that recommendation. That process is obviously transparent, in the sense that we know what the process is. Then, after recommendation, the ministers have the final decision in relation to those loans. It's also worth noting, Senator Brown, that that is the current process. There will be a greater level of transparency and an arms-length operation in assessment of these loans under the new facility than there currently is.

There is an established process under which these projects have to be assessed. I hark back to my point that the minister can only make a determination on a project that has been put forward by a state or territory government. So, within the operating mandate of the corporation and within the advice, there are a whole heap of things that the minister is required to do before making a determination in relation to a project. But you are quite right: this is a matter for government and cabinet, and the government has the ultimate power in this to make a determination in relation to a project that has been recommended.

It doesn't even have to go through the rest of cabinet. It doesn't have parliamentary oversight. You also said that it's set out in the operating mandate, but the operating mandate can be changed by the two ministers without parliamentary oversight. These are our concerns about the governance of this project and resting far too much power in those ministers.

I'm assuming from your answer that you are stating that the states and territories are being consulted on the operating mandate, because you just talked about products. Could you clarify that?

The government is consulting a wide range of stakeholders, including state governments, on the products as opposed to specifically consulting them on the operating mandate. The answer to the question specifically is that we are not explicitly consulting on the operating mandate; we are explicitly consulting about the products that will be offered.

We are finding it very difficult to even get an answer to that very simple question.

You said that we were not consulting. I quite clearly said that we were consulting. I said we weren't consulting specifically on the operating mandateâ€”just to be very clear about that. The bill sets out what can be included in the operating mandate: the objectives to pursue in administering farm loans and the national water infrastructure facility; the government's expectations in relation to the strategies and policies to be followed by the corporation; the eligibility criteria for those loans; and the management of funding in other matters. These will all be outlined in the operating mandate. As I said, it is currently in the process of development. It will not be finalised until after the passage of the bill. However, after the passage of the bill, it will be tabled in the parliament, but not as a disallowable instrument.

So I'd ask the question: why is it seen to be appropriate for those entirely new classes of loans to be able to be at the discretion of ministers in this instance, whereas under the CEFC legislation it was actually included? There were quite strict parameters on what types of investment it could make, and these were included in the CEFC legislation.

There is already a level of definition in the legislation, so I'm not quite sure why you would be suggesting that there isn't.

That's quite clearly the definition there. But, in regard to your point, the minister is still required to take the expert advice of the corporation in relation to the development of any new products. So there is a level of expert advice that is necessarily provided to the ministers prior to their making any decision.

I'm talking about a class of licence of a loan. The classification of the loan and the eligibility to receive a loan is in the legislation. We're currently out consulting particularly and specifically about the eligibility criteria for those loans. That is one area of consultation that is a very high priority at the moment. We are consulting with not only the farming industry but also the banking sector and the states and territories to make sure that the eligibility criteria of the loan are fit for purpose and will result in the efficient and effective delivery of assistance to our farming community. I'm just wondering why you would think that would need to be included in the bill.

I don't think that it's unreasonable that you here are able to define for us what 'class' means in this bill. Essentially, with the minister being able to make directives with regard to particular loans, he's absolutely got the power to issue directives that concern arbitrarily tightening defined classes of loan. I don't think it's unreasonable for the chamber to be advised by government what 'class' means in this bill.

I think it's absolutely important that the government is able to define what it means and the parameters around what the term 'class' means in this bill.

The legislation requires us to meet the criteria of what a farm business loan is before eligibility kicks in. But, just as an example of a class of loan, the dairy recovery loan package would be considered a class of loan. There is debt recovery. That's what a class of loan would be, as defined, under this.

I'm not sure if one takes it on notice in a committee stage, but I will endeavour to find the answer in the next little while as to whether that information is available.

There is really no excuse for not having that information available, given you are responding to concerns that were raised by an organisation that is fundedâ€”you may want to turn to your left, Minister; I think someone is trying to assist. Further to that, whilst you gave an assurance that you had received constitutional advice, you were unprepared or unwilling to table that advice in accordance with regular government practice. Can you assure this chamber that the advice received on the date you don't know by the organisation that you don't know was, in fact, validating the approach that the government has taken in light of the Productivity Commission's concerns?

I just want to make this clear. You have constitutional advice about concerns that you say are not applicable because, when they were raised, they were not relevant to this current thing. It is like torture; a spaghetti jumbleâ€”what happened and how and when it came about. I just want to make sure that the government is 100 per cent confident that what they are doing is compliant with the Constitution, even though I am getting mixed messages with respect to this.

Now, yes, they might not be relevant directly to this bill, but this bill does, in effect, provide the Commonwealth with the facility to provide loans directly to farmers. I am concernedâ€”I don't want to conflate the two issuesâ€”but it is about the constitutionality of the approach the government is taking. I am not trying to be tricky. I don't think you are trying to be tricky, but I just want a clear answer. You've had advice in respect of this bill from the Government Solicitor, which is what you mentioned before. I would like to know when advice was received that it is entirely within the constitutional purview of the government to proceed with this approach.

The loan scheme was designed taking into account a large range of factors, including the Commonwealth's constitutional powers to do this. The legal advice that was taken throughout the process was obviously an iterative approach to receiving advice; it wasn't just one piece of advice received at one point in time. So yes, the government has received legal advice. It received legal advice throughout the whole process in relation to the loan scheme that is being currently designed and the decisions in relation to how that is going to work included the constitutional power for the Commonwealth to be able to undertake and deliver the loans under the proposed method.

Do you envisage that a class of loans could be restricted geographically, for example, to a state? Could it be a class of loans to a particular agricultural industry in a particular state?

The underlying reason for this particular package is the ability for governments to be much more responsive to the needs of our farming community. As you would be aware, having a keen interest in the farm sector, farming takes many and varied forms. In that case, we can have localised distress occur because a particular area is impacted by a localised or regionalised event or activity. Equally, a single industry can be impacted across the whole country, which means that there is a little bit of the industry through many jurisdictions. A classic example of that more recently has been the situation that occurred with the crisis in the dairy industry; probably no state felt it more keenly than the state which you represent as a senator. So the ability for the classes of loans to be immediately responsive and reactive to situations that we find our farming communities getting themselves into or being impacted by without much notice is important. So the answer to your question is yes. The loan classes are, in effect, designed so that they can be quickly responsive to situations to assist our farmers as quickly, effectively and efficiently as possible.

As I said earlier to Senator Brown, there is quite an extensive consultation going on at the moment in terms of developing the criteria both in the operating mandate in the broader terms of eligibility, which is the consultation that is currently being undertaken, and also in relation to any direction that comes from the minister. Obviously, the criteria under which accessibility of the particular loan would be available would be determined. In terms of the operating mandate, it is an instrument to be tabled in the parliament.

It is up to the operating mandate, which is not a disallowable instrument. It's up to the ministers to decide in their judgement, and just the ministers, not even going to the cabinet. It's going to be up them, with executive power to decide that there's suddenly government largesse that would be available to a particular industry in a particular state. This is why we have grave concerns about this legislation. It is setting up a slush fund to be able to be used by the government of the day.

The eligibility criteria for loans and financial assistance are matters over which the executive arm of government currently has control, and it's the opinion and belief of government that it should retain control. The potential impact on the budget is quite considerable, and obviously the executive of government has a responsibility for budgetary control. Therefore, we absolutely believe that it's appropriate that this remains in the control of executive government.

We have just found through the High Court case on equal marriage that there is a $295 million line in the budget each year that we understood was for urgent and unforeseen circumstances but that the High Court has now found is basically there as a fund for whatever the government of the day wants to fund. So you have that ability to essentially hand out loans to suit the political purposes of the government without the parliamentary oversight that would be appropriate in such a scheme. We haven't got a problem with having loans schemes. There should be much stricter controls included in the legislation, not leaving so much power in the hands of the ministers.

What we're proposing here is a greater level of transparency and notification in relation to those guidelines. Obviously, the agriculture and finance ministers are required to agree to those guidelines.

Existing loans require a hardship element, and the board will be required to comply with that existing requirement.

                                                                                                                      Senator Rice, at the risk of repeating myself for the 14th time, the current situation, which everyone seems to be quite satisfied with, allows the executive of government to undertake and make these decisions in relation to this particular suite of products that are in the marketplace. These products have a very specific role to play, and that is to assist our farming community when situations of hardship affect themâ€”most often not of their own making.
                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                      Currently, we have a suite of products. Definitely, after the consultation and discussions that I have had in my role as the assistant minister, and also through my role as someone who's lived in rural and regional Australia for many years, the ability for responsiveness in these loans is something that's been criticised for some time. We have a situation right now where we are providing this assistance to communities across the whole of rural and regional Australia. We're seeking to do so by a mechanism that is now going to enable it to be more streamlined and more responsive, and which is actually going to provide a better service to those people who are affected.
                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                      To have a situation as you're proposing, where we have some sort of extraordinarily high level of parliamentary power to be able to come in and make decisions in relation to stuffâ€”decisions that have in the past always been made by the executive arm of government, for the reasons that I stated previouslyâ€”is, first of all, an extraordinary precedent to set. But think about the farmers who wish to be able to get accessâ€”very often with some level of speed. You're suggesting here that it's appropriate for us to have this extraordinarily increased level of intervention by this very parliament. That is something that is quite unprecedented in the level of intervention that you are proposing by suggesting that every single thing has to come here to somehow get ticked off by you.

It's just making things like the operating mandate a disallowable instrument so that there is parliamentary oversight on the classes of loans. Just like in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act, it will specify in the legislation what the types of loans can be. It is having that high level of parliamentary oversight, as is reflected in the proposed amendments by the Labor Party, which the Greens will be supporting.

This level of detail is in the legislation, but the level of detail as to what the money will be able to be directed to is out of the legislation. Why is it considered appropriate to have that level of detail in the legislation where the minister can say to the board, 'This is where your corporation is going to be located,' and yet requirements such as a hardship provision or the fact that you won't be able to target particular regional areas without a hardship provision aren't included in the legislation?

The Scrutiny of Bills Committee report found that the current bill lacked the appropriate high-level guidance as to the types of terms and conditions that states and territories will be required to comply with in order to receive payment of financial assistance for water infrastructure projects. Throughout the committee stage thus far, I haven't received any comfort from the minister's responses to the questions that have been asked. Regarding the water and infrastructure projects, this includes a legislative requirement that any directions made by the responsible ministers under subclause 12(3) and any agreements with the states and territories about these grants of financial assistance are tabled in the parliament within 15 sitting days after being made and published on the internet within 30 days after being made.
                                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                                             The scrutiny committee also expressed concerns about the bill exemption from disallowance and sunsetting. Minister Ruston has claimed that the normal parliamentary oversight and scrutiny will exist with regard to the corporation. However, while the bill provides for the operating mandate to be treated as a legislative instrument and will require it to be tabled, it will not be subject to disallowance and sunsetting.
                                                                                                                            </p>

The government is claiming that this requirement will ensure that there will be appropriate transparency of ministerial directions to the corporation. Non-disallowable instruments do not allow for the proper oversight and parliamentary scrutiny of ministerial directions. Labor's amendments seek to strengthen the proper oversight and parliamentary scrutiny for directions made by the minister.

It is lacking in detail, and we have seen a number of amendments put forward in an attempt to strengthen the bill. Labor urges all senators to support Labor's amendments to ensure that there is proper parliamentary oversight and scrutiny of the corporation.

The reasons for this have been largely canvassed in the previous discussions prior to the moving of these amendments. In effect, the government believe that the operating mandate should not be a disallowable instrument, as it deals with matters over which the executive arm of government should retain control. We believe that the approach in the bill gives the parliament the right level of oversight of the operating mandate, given the nature and significance of that direction to the entity. Firstly, the bill requires and provides for the mandate to be a legislative instrument, which requires it to be tabled. The approach has been taken despite the express exemption that exists for directions of ministers to corporate Commonwealth entities. We have required that to be included. We believe the government is being open and transparent and, in this instance, going beyond the minimum requirements. As I said before, this approach is not unusual, and I have cited the C

We believe it would also reduce the Commonwealth's flexibility when negotiating with the states and territories and could be confusing for the corporation in terms of compliance. We believe the parliament has the appropriate level of visibility of these grants for financial assistance and for water infrastructure projects, and this will be achieved through the tabling of the operating mandate and the contents thereof, as well as through the reporting requirements for corporate Commonwealth entities under the Public Governance, Performance and

That level of detail is completely lacking in this legislation.
                                                                                                                              </p>

Alternatively, I think you'd have to go back to the drawing board and set out in much greater detail what it's appropriate for these levels of loans to be spent on. The fact that there is nothing regarding hardship requirements included in the legislation and that there is no definition of what a class of farm business loans is means it is open slather for the ministers to be able to make decisions on their own. The powers for them to direct the board are really setting up a very undemocratic and unaccountable institution. These Labor amendments, which we are supportive of, go some way to having a level of parliamentary oversight that is absolutely required.

These obligations require that a corporate plan be prepared and published on the corporation's website. The corporation must also prepare annual reports to be tabled in parliament by the responsible ministers. The corporation's annual reports must include a statement of performance which sets out the results, measurements and assessment identified in the entity's corporate plan, and the annual reports also need to detail any directions issued by the responsible ministers.

The independence of the corporation is critical when establishing the eligibility criteria for loans or financial assistance. The lack of detail about what loans and financial assistance will be provided by the corporation is concerning when we know that the current concessional loans take into consideration the viability of the farm enterprise. To ensure that the corporation is able to manage its lending criteria, the responsible ministers should not be able to give directions about eligibility criteria for loans or financial assistance.

We believe they are matters over which the executive arm of government should retain control as they have the potential to impact on the Commonwealth budget. We, therefore, believe it's appropriate that they are provided for in the bill as directions to the entity rather than as rules. We also believe that it's appropriate that they are not disallowable.

It is essential that there be more in the legislation that explicitly outlines what can and can't be lent to and does not leave it to the discretion of the minister, who can then direct the board.

Minister Ruston should familiarise herself with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act. It certainly does not have a clause whereby the responsible minister can direct where the corporation is to be located.
                                                                                                                                   </p>

Minister Ruston has provided no detailed information about what process was undertaken to determine that Orange is the best location for the corporation and whether any other regional centre was considered before Orange was selected. Concerns have been raised by stakeholders that the location of the RIC has been unilaterally decided without any apparent economic analysis or even a discussion with the agricultural industry stakeholders, and this in turn has highlighted another dimension of the non-commercial nature of the corporation.

The location should be decided on the grounds of where it can best do its job, and this decision should be made by the board of the RIC.

It's in line with the exemptions under the Legislation (Exemptions and Other Matters) Regulation that a direction is not a legislative instrument and therefore is not disallowable. This approach also provides certainty to the board about where the corporation will be located and will allow it to have focus on having the corporation fully operational by July 2018.

The fact that the board is being directed to establish its headquarters in Orange underlines the whole rationale behind so much of this legislation. It is giving power without any assessment process, without any objective process. It gives the minister the power to direct the board, quite inappropriately.

There is no process that's been undertaken to determine that, just like with the APVMA, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. Suddenly Minister Joyce plucked Armidale out of the air and said, 'It's going to be there,' with no justification. We saw in the cost-benefit analysis that was done that in fact there was a negative benefit in establishing the headquarters of the APVMA in Armidale.

It is blatant pork-barrelling. That's all it is. Without parliamentary oversight and without any process, we have a situation of putting far too much power in the hands of the executive. This might be the way the government wants to do business, but it is not good governance. It is not good, transparent, accountable, evidence-based legislation and governing. Supporting this amendment, at least, is one tiny thing that would improve this legislation. The fact that the government is opposing this amendment bells the cat. It shows so much of what the purpose of this legislation is based on.

Are you able to confirm that a whiteboard and a similar process will be used to determine where these grants should be given in the event of propping up marginal seats?

I'm heartened by your reassurance that all the appropriate probity and accountability of government will be brought to bear in many of these grants. But what you've said flies in stark contrast to what Senator Rice has been sayingâ€”which has resonated with me, quite franklyâ€”which is that there is no real, formal approval process. The board can make some suggestions which the minister can ignore and establish new classes of grants and dispense them wherever they like. For example, they could, in the interests of equality, not only give them to Armidale and Orange but they might slot it into Renmark for no particular reasonâ€”maybe to support the good work of a senator down there, or something like that. It doesn't seem as if there is any rationale or criteria attached to where these grants can go apart from the whims of the minister at the time.

To place such discretion in the hands of any one individual without the checks and balances that accrue from the parliamentâ€”and I do note that the government has voted against the disallowance of these grants, these potential boondoggles, these potential whiteboard/sports rorts, to coin a term; these could be ag rorts in a future life. These are normal checks and balances that accompany the responsibilities and roles of government.

I know you are not in cabinet, Minister. I think you've been given a hospital pass here in some respects, and I'm sorry for that, but, in effect, this doesn't seem even to have gone through the normal cursory examinations and consultation attached to cabinet probity. It just seems as if it's been cooked up on the whim of one or two individuals in order to give them some discretion to prop up political threats, and that really concerns me. I don't think it's the right approach. It overturns the principles of federation. As I said, it overturns some of the concerns raised on the constitutionality by the

It overturns the expectation of appropriate consultation and examination by the parliament and the ability to say, 'This is absolutely wrong.' It has all the hallmarks of a scheme that is going to be rorted. It may be well intended, but these are serious concerns. Minister, whilst you have assured us of these probities, I still haven't heard an effective response to Senator Rice's concerns that, in effect, this is just a bag of money that is at ministerial discretion to throw out wherever they like.

First of all, to put this on the record: Orange has a series of quite unique characteristics that make it a particularly ideal location in terms of creating a critical mass of infrastructure in relation to agriculture in a regional community. I'm assuming you are not suggesting for a minute that we shouldn't be decentralising and giving support to the regional communities around Australia, including the one in which I live.

It's also worth pointing out that all the way through here we have interspersed the word 'loans' with the word 'grants'. I'd like to put on the record and make sure it is very clear that we are referring to loans and not grants.

There was no indication of whether there were any other locationsâ€”and there are many locations around Australia that have vibrant farming communities. Unless the minister can tell us now what the process was and what, if any, other locations were considered, the only thing that we in this chamber can safely assume is that this is about pork-barrelling by Mr Joyce and a political fix for the National Party. That is the only conclusion that we can come to, because the minister has failed to tell this chamber exactly what the process was.

We saw it with the siting of the APVMA in Armidale, and that has not gone well. We've seen expert people leave that organisation. We have seen the backlog of work that hasn't been able to be undertaken because of the concern and uncertainty that Mr Joyce has caused. So it is vital in this committee stage that the minister tells this chamber quite clearly what process was undertaken to select Orange as the location for the commission.

One is that I think we need to be very careful that you don't make a quantum leap of faith to suggest that the decision of the government to pursue its decentralisation targets and policy to move a number of agencies out of capital cities and into regional communities, where they're closer to the people that they represent, has been the cause of what has been a long-term systemic underperformance of the APVMA. I think we just need to be very careful that you don't accuse something of being the cause of something that it actually wasn't.
                                                                                                                                             </p>

Yesterday afternoon, I think, I made the point that it is a decision of government. The government has exercised its right in making that decision, but in doing so it has provided, ad nauseam, a number of different reasons why it believes Orange is an extraordinarily suitable place for this organisation. As a rural and regional member of this parliament, I can assure you that I could go and speak to every one of my colleagues and they would all have somewhere in their electorates where they would like to have a government agency located. However, in doing so, everybody still has to demonstrate that it is a suitable place and an appropriate place and that there are strong reasons for the location of any government instrumentality in any area, rural or metropolitan. Quite clearly, Orange has a whole heap of factors and a whole heap of attributes that are attractive for the location of this instrumentality. I can go through them all again with you, but, in the interests of time, I will allow you to re-read

I find this very interesting and very enlightening because, essentially, you've said that there are a number of criteria from which the government has chosen this location, and you've put that on the record. Surely, Orange was not the only candidate. So my question, which builds upon Senator Brown's question, is: how many local council areas were approached about their interest in having the

And, as you would know, from your previous experience of belonging to the same party that I do, we quite clearly as a government are trying to establish centres of excellence in our regional areas, so that we can create the economic activity that drives our regional economies because, at the risk of sounding parochially regional, it is our regional communities that drive the economy of this country.

I've just outlined that there were a number of other locations that were considered; however, the government made the decision that Orange was the most suitable location.

It wasn't an objective process that the department undertook that ended up going through some criteria and saying, 'Yes, after considering all of these criteriaâ€”on objective, transparent criteriaâ€”Orange came out on top.' It was a political decision made by the minister to establish this corporation in Orange because it suited his political purposes, because it is where the shooters and fishers are threatening to hold the seat which the Nationals lost to the shooters and fishers. It is pure, blatant pork-barrelling. You have not outlined that there was any process at all that was objective, that was transparent or that came through the department. It was a political decision by Minister Joyce, who has got form in making these types of political decisions.

Those criteria obviously have been considered by government as meeting the objectives and the requirements of the location of this organisation better than a number of other locations that were considered, as I've pointed out, not exclusively but including the locations that I read out in response to the question that I received from Senator Bernardi. I can go through all of the reasons why Orange was considered to be the preferred location and why it was chosen as the location for the Regional Investment Corporation. However, as I say, in the interests of time, I won't waste the chamber's time.

Is it available? Can you outline how each of the other locations that were on the shortlist, such as Bathurst and Albury-Wodonga, compared with Orange. What was the assessment process that was undertaken? Can details of that assessment process be tabled so that there is some transparency and so that we can see, on the basis of these criteria, that Orange came out on top, because unless you can do that everything points to this just being a pure and simple pork-barrelling slush fund exercise of getting a government department in Orange to suit the National Party in these circumstances.

You mentioned a moment ago that there were certain other areas that had been considered. Were they approached? Did they know they were being considered? I don't understand why the decision was made. I accept that it's within the government's power to make this decision, but why wasn't there any kind of open tender process? You're saying that you had set criteria against which you came to the decision you did, but why not let those communities and those areas put forward their own pitches for this kind of proposal? I am wondering why that was not how the decision was made.

How does the coordination with the state government work on a matter like this? Was there coordination with the state government? Were there discussions with the state government? One of the reasons you gave for Orange being the location that was chosen was that the government felt that Orange was superior to the other locations. The key reason you gave was that the state department of agriculture is already based there. How did the coordination work? Were they contacted and was there discussion with them before the announcement was made?

There were about 55 different stakeholders that were formally consulted as part of that process, including instruments of government in the other states around Australia, as well as industry and communities and governmentsâ€”and banks, obviously, as well, given that it was a loan facility. Quite separately, that consultation occurred in relation to the loans facility.

As I said to Senator Dastyari, as I said to Senator Brown, as I've said to you and as I've said to Senator Bernardi, it was a decision of government.

I have given you all of the background as to why the RIC was chosen. The government and the minister stand by the decision that Orange is the most suitable and the best place for the location. I have provided information to you and to others in the chamber in relation to other locations that were considered by government as possibly being locations for the RIC.

I think, when you consider all of the reasons Orange is a suitable location, you would have to acknowledge that it is. The deliberations of government as to why Orange was chosen, I think, are self-evident in the characteristics of this particular town.

We have no idea as to what informed his decision.

I have given you a series of towns and locations that were considered by the ministers as potentially being appropriate. I have advised you that the decision of government was that Orange was considered to be the most suitable. I'm not sure what further information I can provide you, apart from saying that it is entirely within the authority of the government to make the decision, and it's made it.

There was no submission process. It sounds like the towns that were apparently on this short list didn't even know that they were on the short list. And why were those towns on the short list whereas other towns that equally could have been on the short list, like Launceston and Cairns, were not? So you aren't able to share any more information with us, but it just goes to the point that there was clearly no objective, transparent process for the selection of the short list. It sounds to me like the minister was riffing off names and saying, 'Yes, we could think of these six cities that possibly could have been sites, and we are choosing Orange.' I have nothing against Orange. It's a lovely place, and there are some criteria as to why it could be appropriate for it to be there, but the point is process. The point is having an appropriate, objective, transparent, accountable, evidence based process that you aren't able to share with us because it's quite clear that it doesn't exist.

That directions power is an important part of the government's arrangements of the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility and provides the mechanism for government to communicate its decisions on projects that have been approved for a loan. The amendment makes it clear that, in giving a direction under clause 12(3), the responsible ministers need to exercise their powers consistently with the Water Act 2007. They will also have to seek the advice of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority before issuing a direction under clause 12(3). This requirement ensures that the responsible ministers receive advice on the consistency of the projects with the Basin Plan from the independent body that is best placed to make the assessment. The government is committed to working with states and territories to build the water infrastructure needed for agricultural industries to expand and increase their productivity, and the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility is a critical part of that commitment.

This is an important amendment in the context of ensuring that there is no ambiguity in how the Regional Investment Corporation will operate in the context of water policy and that the Water Act will not in any way be affected by this and, in particular, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and sustainable diversion limits. The amendment is self-evident. Senator Ruston has alluded to productive discussions that I've had with her and the Deputy Prime Minister in respect of this.

I have spoken to the honourable Mr Hunter in the last 36 hours about the need for this.

It's something I have discussed with departmental officers. Does this amendment give rights of judicial review to those who have standing to ensure that it is complied with? In other words, we're not just saying that this must be complied with; can it actually be enforced through a judicial review process?

The amendments will also require the RIC board to consult with the basin authority. I'm not surprised that Senator Xenophon talked about ambiguity in this area, because that ambiguity and that concern follows some of the statements made by the Deputy Prime Minister in response to allegations that water is being taken out of the basin: essentially, that there was nothing to see here.

The influence of the responsible ministers means that the corporation lacks the proper independence and transparency required for the corporation to work effectively and efficiently. But we, as I have said, will be supporting the government's amendments.

We note in the contributions by the minister and by Senator Xenophon phrases like, 'It's going to ensure that there's no ambiguity,' and, 'It's a belt-and-braces approach, giving certainty and confidence.' Minister, is there actually anything in these amendments that does change things other than as they would already have been underneath the Water Act? What difference will it make to water projectsâ€”compared to the Water Actâ€”if this legislation, and this amendment in particular, is passed?

I just wanted to say that Senator Rice's question is a very important question. My understanding, from a point of view of statutory interpretation is that where you have two competing acts there sometimes may be some ambiguity. Having this particular amendment removes that ambiguity. I think it's fair to say that what Senator Ruston said is absolutely rightâ€”the intent is that the Water Act is at all times adhered to, particularly when it comes to sustainable diversion limits and the like. But, if there could potentially, as a question of law, sometimes be a conflict between the two acts which could be the subject of legal argument, this amendment would remove that issue of legal argument. You've got some esteemed lawyers from the department behind you who know more about administrative law than I ever willâ€”apart from being a plaintiff or defendant in administrative law cases. I suggest to Senator Rice that this amendment is doing some good work. It's not just a symbolic amendment; it actually ensures that there cannot be an argument down the track to say that the Regional Investment Corporation Act takes precedence over the Water Act, which could be a potential argument. That's my jurisprudential lesson for the day. Maybe the lawyers there will disagree with me; I'll try and dig up some case law if they do, so just give me a moment.

There may well be environmental lawyers who Senator Rice deals with as well, but I think it is a belt-and-braces approach in a meaningful way.

The Pastoralists and Graziers Association of WA argued that a board membership of three was too small, arguing that the size of the board and its composition should be similar to that found in private financial organisations in order to cover the range of qualifications.

Ensuring that the CEO discloses any conflicts of interest will reduce the risk of any potential for corruption and/or misconduct. For the minister's information, that is a part of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We hope that the government will consider this amendment, see that this is an amendment worthy of support and support the amendment before us now.

Again, given the issues that we've been discussing this morning about how much power is vested in the minister, having elements of transparency and accountability by the board, and particularly with a potentially small board, is really critical. I note the minister saying that the board can be up to five. You may as well say that the board could be up to 11. If you can have a board of only three, that's the minimum. If you've got a board of only three and you don't necessarily have to have the high levels of disclosure that would be required by this amendment, you have serious potential issues of accountability.

As to the sorts of processes that have occurredâ€”or the lack of process, as we have previously discussedâ€”on significant issues, as to where the corporation is going to be located: it is very clear there was a lack of process. And this goes to the heart of the problems with this whole corporation in the way it is being set up: the lack of transparency, accountability and good governance process in its establishment.

We are talking about a corporation that is administering $4 billion. As to suggesting that a minimum of three on the board is sufficientâ€”it isn't. Throughout this bill, we have seen that the good governance isn't there and the level of transparency that we would normally expect to see under similar legislation is not there.

Well, there was actually no consultation, and I think it's fair to say that at least we now understand that there is no location. But this is a regional corporation that is administering $4 billion, and this government is suggesting that just having a minimum of three board members is sufficient. As to this amendment that we have before us now, all it's asking is that there be a disclosure of conflict of interest. I understand, and I take on board, what the minister said in response to my first contribution on this amendment. But, given the lack of governance and the lack of transparency, and the fact that it has been very difficult to find any information around this bill coming from the minister or the government, I really believe that, if what the minister says is correct, there should be no issue with the government supporting this amendment.
