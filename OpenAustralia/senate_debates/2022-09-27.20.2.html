        was nothing short of disgraceful, another taxpayer funded hit job for the Lefty luvvies. The board at the failing ABC, who champion this cavalier faux journalism, should be ashamed of themselves for using our once-great national broadcaster to serve up a bucket of slop.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night we had roughly six minutes of hearing positive insights from interviewees and over 17 minutes from other guests who spent their time trashing Peter Dutton and his reputation. This is rich given most of them haven't even met Mr Dutton—very balanced reporting from the ABC, as always!

        The line-up of irrelevant guests rolled out by

This is Peter Dutton, a former police officer from Queensland. This is a diabolically terrible take, typical of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">

        cooked universe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter Dutton has maintained a lifelong commitment to keeping all Australians safe. Being a dad and a former police officer, there's nothing radical or scary about his agenda to keep all Australians safe. The ABC continues to openly wage war on centre-right attitudes, values and beliefs—and, indeed, centre-right political parties. The ABC treats Australians who do not share their fanciful leftist ideology with disdain. Australians deserve better from our national broadcaster. Last night
        <i>
         Four Corners
        </i>
        was a bucket of slop, and we deserve better. The taxpayers deserve better from the ABC. It's time to reform it.
