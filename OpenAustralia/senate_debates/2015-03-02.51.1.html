          Mr President
         </a>
         , you and colleagues may recall that last year I was forced to cease the Dementia and Severe Behaviours Supplement, which it would be fair to say was less than well designed by those opposite. The design premise of those opposite was that only 2,000 people would trigger provider eligibility for that supplement. In reality it ended up being 33,000 people who triggered provider eligibility, and rather than costing $11.7 million as budgeted it cost $135 million; and if the existing claiming patterns had continued, rather than costing $52 million over the forward estimates it would have cost $780 million and, indeed, $1.5 billion over 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the time that I concluded that supplement I indicated that the government was determined to put in its place an alternative within the existing funding envelope over the forward estimates of about $52 million. I am very pleased, Mr President, to let you and colleagues know that as a result of consultation with the sector the government has announced that we will invest $54.5 million over four years to establish severe behaviour response teams. These teams will be a mobile workforce of clinical experts who will provide timely and expert advice to residential aged care providers that seek help to address the needs of people who manifest the most severe behaviours associated with dementia.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister explain to the Senate how these response teams will provide targeted assistance to aged-care providers who take care of residents experiencing severe behaviours associated with dementia?

           The severe behaviour response teams will, as I mentioned, be comprised of clinical experts trained to work with people who exhibit severe behaviours. They will be a mobile workforce. The teams will commence operations nationally later this year following a competitive tender process. The establishment of these response teams is on a specific recommendation made by the sector to the government through the ministerial dementia forum, which I convened in September last year. That forum brought together more than 60 stakeholders and experts to advise the government on how to encourage better practice dementia care and how to better support people who demonstrate these severe behaviours. The intent of these response teams will be that providers can get support within 24 to 48 hours, and I also think it is very important that we make sure these response teams also work for regional Australia.

             Yes I can. For instance,

              Lin Hatfield Dodds
             </a>
             from UnitingCare said, 'The government's announcement is very good news':
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Additional support to assist residential care providers in meeting this challenge is most welcome.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
              The Government
             </a>
             has clearly heard and understood the concerns raised at the Dementia Forum. We are pleased that the Government has worked with the aged-care sector to find solutions …

             Also, Mr Graeme Samuel, President of Alzheimer's Australia, said:

            <p class="italic">
             Announcements of this kind provide much needed national leadership in tackling dementia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, Dr Stephen Judd of HammondCare said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             HammondCare welcomes the release of additional funds to deploy mobile teams of clinical experts supporting the care of aged care residents experiencing severe behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.
            </p>
            <p>
             I indicated at Senate estimates to Senator Polley that I would be very happy to arrange a more detailed briefing for her on these response teams, and I extend that invitation to any other colleagues who are interested.
