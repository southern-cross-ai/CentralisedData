         Breast Cancer Awareness Month
        </a>
        and tonight I rise to speak on this important issue. Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death by cancer in Australian women. Approximately 13,500 women in Australia are diagnosed with breast cancer each year and one in eight women will be diagnosed before their 85th birthday, with one in four of these women under the age of 50.
       </p>
       <p>
        When my fraternal grandmother passed away from breast cancer, over 50 years ago, it was something that was not spoken about. There is now great national awareness across Australia about breast cancer and especially the importance for women of regularly checking their breasts in addition to having regular mammograms, so they know what feels normal to them so that if and when that normal changes, they can seek advice or a further check-up from a doctor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, women are able to seek support from their families and from the community in the form of support groups run by organisations like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer_Network_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Breast Cancer Network Australia
        </a>
        and also Breast Cancer Care WA, which provides emotional, practical and financial support for women with breast cancer and which holds an annual Purple Bra Day to raise money to assist it in continuing its support for breast cancer patients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the guidance of founder and patron Ros Worthington
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , Breast Cancer Care WA has grown since its beginnings in 2000 to provide support and educational services across the spectrum, including specialist breast care nurses; financial assistance for rural patients; specific programs for Indigenous women and their families; help with basics, like cleaning, while women are undergoing treatment; and many other services.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have groups like Breast Cancer Care WA, the Breast Cancer Network Australia and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Breast_Cancer_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         National Breast Cancer Foundation
        </a>
        to thank for helping to raise both the profile and awareness of the disease and the funds for research to help find out more about the disease and, of course, to help find a cure. Groups like these are exceptionally resourceful and skilled at raising money, and overwhelmingly do so to provide a public benefit without drawing on the government purse for help.
       </p>
       <p>
        For that reason in particular I believe it is important to draw attention to the work that they do and to commend them in the highest possible way for that work, without which women with breast cancer, as well as their families, would suffer a far more dramatic journey through diagnosis, treatment and, hopefully, remission.

        Day was held a week ago on 22 October, and it is a testament to the work of the National Breast Cancer Foundation that the 'Pink Ribbon' brand is now so well known throughout Australia and is so well supported by Australians of all ages and from all walks of life.

        and Parliament House—are lit up in pink this month as part of the Estee Lauder Companies Global Landmark Illumination Initiative, to assist in raising money for research. Global illumination and the National Breast Cancer Foundation are in partnership in an international campaign to bring about not just greater awareness of breast cancer but also to promote early detection. The Canberra sites are five of 45 sites around Australia which are being lit up in pink this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Breast Cancer Foundation was established in 1994, and will soon be celebrating its 20th anniversary. During its existence, $81 million has been awarded across Australia to fund more than 300 Australian-based research projects that have helped to improve the health and wellbeing of women affected by breast cancer. The research is across the spectrum of the experience that women with breast cancer have, in order to improve understanding of the basics of the disease right through to research targeted at improving the quality of life for survivors of the disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        As stated on its website, its aspirational goal is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … to achieve zero death from breast cancer by 2030.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, while there are 37 Australians being diagnosed every day with breast cancer and seven who pass away every day from the disease, there is still much work to be done. Fourteen thousand, six hundred and ten women are predicted to be diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia this year alone, and that figure is projected to reach 17,210, or 47 diagnoses on average a day by 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to note than men, too, can develop breast cancer, with about one per cent of cases affecting men. Unfortunately, this is an increasing diagnosis rate and is one of the major reasons why early detection is so important.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to take this opportunity to remind women how they can best reduce their chance of developing breast cancer or cancer of any kind. This information is taken from the National Breast Cancer Foundation website:

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        All women, even those who are under the age of 50 and therefore not yet recommended to be having mammograms, should look for the following signs and remain breast aware:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        … … …

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Younger women should also be aware that they are not immune to the disease, and need to be vigilant about the warning signs. The following testimonial is from a young woman named Skye, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the tender age of 29:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Starting chemotherapy was the toughest time of my life, it was scary and I felt just awful. After a period I got used to the cycles and was able to feel okay most of the time. I set about getting back my life. I was fortunate enough to move in with some very supportive friends, bought myself some treats and started looking for work again, and realised not only did I have a life worth living, but what a fantastic life it would be!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am now out of the dark and into the ever-increasingly bright light. Cancer truly does give you that all important perspective on life. Each day brings a beauty to it that I might have otherwise missed. Sunsets have never been more beautiful, birds singing never sounded sweeter. It has also given me a strength that I never knew existed, and a confidence that I can tackle anything life throws at me. As for love.... he'd have to be a pretty special guy to fit into my life now, as it is full to bursting, doing all the things I love in life, including bringing awareness to young women about breast cancer. This is my life now, and I wouldn't change it for the world.

        This time last year I had the great honour of hosting a Pink Ribbon morning tea in Rockingham, in my patron electorate of Brand, with Donna Gordin, the federal Liberal candidate for Brand for the next election, and the member for Mackellar, the Hon.

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        We were delighted to raise more than $1,200 on that day. We were privileged to have breast cancer survivor Valma Sulc share her very personal story of her experience with cancer with us. In fact, she was doing that publicly for the first time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Better research, science and awareness of breast cancer now means we have a better chance of catching cancer early and treating it with greater success. I would urge everyone to make sure the women in their lives—whether they are wives, partners, friends, sisters, daughters, mothers, aunties or others—are taking care of their health and are aware of what is normal for them, and are not just taking note but taking action when that changes. I commend the scientists, the volunteers and the organisations working to help increase survival rates. To Australian families currently dealing with cancer, I commend you on your courage and wish you the strength of body and spirit to continue.
