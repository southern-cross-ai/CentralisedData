        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. Minister, on 7 June 2023, in an interview on ABC

        , journalist Hamish Macdonald put the following statement to you:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Macdonald asked you if Mr Sharaz was a friend. You responded:

          I had a professional relationship with Mr Sharaz, as I presume many in this place did, because he worked in this place as well for some time. That is the extent of it. In terms of where this is getting to now, I would appreciate it if people would think about the impact that it's having on women. I have been inundated with calls from women's organisations and from women themselves who are concerned about how this debate is going to impact on women making choices about their own safety. You may be able to live with your conscience on that, but I can't live with mine. So my responsibility is to stand up and say—I'm happy to answer questions like Ms Henderson has asked—it was a professional relationship with a journalist that I knew when I was in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
           ACT
          </a>
          , and I came across him when he was working here when I moved up to the Senate. That is the extent of that. I expect that relationship exists for a number of senators around this place.

                       I take a point of order, President. In the interests of trying to deal appropriately with this, we have not taken points of order as to whether the questions are in order. I make the point that that question about friendship neither relates to the minister's portfolio nor to a previous statement. I again raise my concern from yesterday, and I ask people to reflect upon whether the use of private text messages of an alleged survivor is an ethical thing to use to ask questions in this place, particularly given what the

                         President, just on the point of order: Senator Wong's premise that the question is not based upon public statements is incorrect. The primary question was based upon public statements made by the minister during an interview on

                          Thank you. Because it's quite an unusual question I will seek advice from the Clerk. I am advised, and I urge senators to remember the primary question. The view is that we have drifted quite a way from the primary question, so I invite the minister to answer the second supplementary to any extent she wishes to.

                              Thank you. I start by saying I'm not responsible for how people describe their relationship with me. In Senator Henderson's question she again raises the text messages that have been published in the
                              <i>
                               Australian
                              </i>
                              . When they are raising that, I again ask people to think about what message that is sending out to women right now who are living in dangerous situations and to consider the impact on them. Frankly, we have a bigger job to do in here to protect those women. When they see seemingly illegally accessed documents are then published on the
                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
                               TV
                              </a>
                              and in newspapers and repeated constantly in this place, the message to them is: 'Watch out. Don't open your mouth.' I think that is wrong. I think we have a responsibility to ensure that that isn't the message out of this place.
