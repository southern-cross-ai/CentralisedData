        The government at the moment is proposing industrial relations reform. It is tinkering. That's all it is. What I want to do is discuss the bigger picture that we need to consider. First, let's look at the decline of our country. Look at the decline since 1944, with the stealing of property rights from 1996 onwards and with the destruction of the electricity sector, the guts of our manufacturing sector and our agriculture sector. And yet, at a time when other countries have been reducing their electricity prices, Australian electricity prices have doubled or even tripled. We've got a taxation system that's counterproductive, and there's the neglect of our water infrastructure. Overregulation is decimating our manufacturing sector and, in fact, all sectors, especially small business—our biggest employers. Now let's look at the recent devastation from the COVID restrictions, or rather government restrictions imposed as a result of COVID. They're capricious, unsafe and devastating on small business and employees. If you look at Queensland, Victoria and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , COVID is managing us. Pretty soon JobKeeper ends—in fact, it ends at the end of next month—and then what will happen?
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's come back to what we need. We will work with the government to fix a bad bill—that is, its latest proposal. We will work with them in an attempt to do that. The three aims guiding us are: protecting honest workers, protecting small business and restoring Australia's productive capacity. But not just to recover back to where we were last February before the COVID restrictions from government but to recover back to where we were when we were at the top of the world. We were literally number one for per capita gross domestic product.

         If I

        had a wish list, these are the things that would be on it—at least some of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would want an inquiry into local government corruption in Queensland. Right across the state the waste of federal funding runs into the billions, with the fraud, the extortion, the corruption, the threats and the intimidation. We want to end that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would wish for a Commonwealth integrity commission, especially now that, during the last week, we've learnt what happened in this building. We need a proper corruption-ending system in this parliament and in this building. We need to restore integrity. We also need proper industrial relations reform—not the tinkering, the increased complexity nor the abandonment of small business. We need proper reform that looks after all employers and employees. We need proper reform that enables, first of all, employers and employees to restore their primary relationship without the

        club dipping into their pockets and putting handcuffs on them. We need to restore primary workplace relationships. We need to make it easier for people to work. We need to remove the complexity and remove the lawyers and the vultures.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to reform taxation. We need proper taxation reform—not tinkering and not adding more complexity to tax. We need to make it simpler for companies and small businesses to employ people. We need to make it easier for employees, honest workers, to keep more of their pay for their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need reform of the family law system. We need reform of water. We need to do much, much better with our water. We need to return environmental water management to the states. We need to introduce a water register—it's 14 years overdue. We need to introduce a weirs-for-life program and turn around drains in the south-east. We have a comprehensive plan we're going to release soon about what we would do with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and water right across the country.
       </p>

        We need to restore farmers' property rights that were stolen in 1996 by the
