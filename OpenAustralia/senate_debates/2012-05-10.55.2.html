        My question is to the minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. Why does a government which is promising surpluses for each single year over the forward estimates have to pay $1.2 billion more in net interest payments to service its debts in 2015-16 than it does in 2012-13? Is the government expected government borrowings to go up over that period or interest rates or both?

           , on a point of order: I cannot see how the minister's abuse can in any way be directly relevant to the question. My question was why the government has to pay more interest on its debt in 2015-16 than in 2012-13 when they are telling us they will have surpluses over this period. I want to know very specifically, from the minister, whether the government expect government borrowings to go up or whether they expect interest rates to go up or whether they expect both to go up. That is the specific question, and none of the minister's answer so far were directly relevant to the question.

             . It is the case, if Senator Cormann considers the budget papers—and I assume he has—that there is an increase in 2015-16 in the net interest payment line. This is due to the maturing of a Treasury index bond line in that year. In that year all of the capitalised indexation of the principal is accounted for as interest and this adds to the net interest in that year over and above what normal interest on those bonds would be. This is explained in the budget papers at page 714.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have laid out our path to surplus. We have demonstrated how we will grow the surplus over time every year of the forward estimates. We have ensured that we remain below the level of taxation that Treasurer Costello bequeathed to us. We have made sure we have constrained payments as a share of the economy to a level not seen over the forward estimates since the 1980s. I invite those on the other side who think that the Liberal Party should actually be a party that is fiscally responsible to demonstrate that they are, because at the moment their economic team is characterised—

              , I have a supplementary question. How many schools, hospitals or roads could the government fund if it did not have to pay $29 billion in net interest payments to service the debt Labor has accumulated over the past 4½ years in government?

               I am asked about schools funding and hospitals funding. I remind those opposite that we have almost doubled schools funding. That is what this government has done. I remind those opposite of the increase in expenditure on hospitals, when they are led by a man who took $1 billion out of the public hospital system. But, if you want to talk to us about cuts, how many schools will you close to make your $70 billion black hole?

                 . Those opposite should tell the Australian people how many schools and hospitals they will close to fill their $70 billion black hole. They are now locked into a pledge for a surplus of one per cent of

                 this year. A $15 billion surplus is what they said. You would have to pay no Medicare next year. You would have to pay no Medicare to anyone in Australia for all of 2012-13 to make the promise you have made.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the minister aware that, once the coalition had paid off $96 billion of Hawke-Keating Labor debt, the government actually received net interest payments instead of having to pay $29 billion in net interest? Isn't this another stark demonstration that Labor does not know how to manage money and that it always comes down to the coalition to fix up Labor's fiscal mess?

                   I am asked about former Treasurer Costello. Quite clearly the regard with which former Treasurer Costello holds the current economic team on that side of the chamber is demonstrated by his desire to return, his desire to ride again, his desire to get back into this place, because he knows those on the other side are incapable of putting a budget bottom line together.

                                    in the budget. His claims that $450 million of additional departmental expenditure in 2011-12 has been brought forward are simply false. The payments are made to Telstra under the terms of the definitive agreement. This is neither new nor news, as those agreements came into force on 7 March 2012 and their treatment within the budget was outlined in a press release distributed on that day. Similarly, the claim of a $400 million blow-out in equity is false, as it simply reflects the equity funding of $350 million deferred from 2011-12 to 2012-13.

                                                , on the point of order. The minister was being directly relevant to the question about policy, the white paper and the government's plans. He was absolutely directly on the issue raised by Senator Johnston in his question. I suggest to Liberal senators who insist on taking a point of order at least once, if not two or three times, that they are preventing the Senate from dealing with more questions both from themselves and from other members of the Senate. I suggest that it is a complete waste of the Senate's time and that it undermines question time.

                                                        , on a point of order, you have given the minister latitude to address the background of the government's considerations of the various criteria that go into its decision making. The question was specific: whether the three per cent real increase was still the policy of the government. In the two seconds remaining, the minister can answer that question—yes or no. The opposition accept the latitude you have given the minister to paint the context, but we have not had an answer. There is time for there to be an answer, and I ask you to direct the minister, in the time remaining to him, to tell us whether it is the government's policy or not.

                                                           , I ask a supplementary question. The 2009 Defence white paper, at page 138, point 18.10, directed that any savings generated by the Strategic Reform Program would be reinvested in acquiring defence capabilities. Is this still government policy?

The government will continue to ensure that Defence will receive the funding it needs, when it needs it, to deliver its projects. However, it is not always possible for Defence to spend the money it has estimated it needs for various reasons. For example, in the 2011-12 budget, Defence reduced its call on the budget by $1.6 billion in 2010-11 and $2.7 billion over the next four years.

Global and domestic economic circumstances have changed significantly since the white paper. The effects of the global financial crisis have contributed to unfold with unexpected severity and duration during the 2009 Defence white paper. Accordingly, the Defence funding model is one of the strategic issues which will be considered through a white paper process. In the meantime, Defence has made a contribution to the return of the budget to surplus, as have other departments and agencies. The 2013 timetable is achievable. The majority of the inputs to the new white paper are already complete or are underway. That includes the Defence Planning Guidance, the Australian Defence Force Posture Review—

My question concerns the budget announcement that people trying to survive on Newstart and other allowances will receive $210 a year supplementary allowance, which equates to less than $4 a week, raises Newstart to $248 a week and leaves recipients $126 below the poverty line. What evidence does the government have that a person can support themselves on $248 per week? What were the policy and economic factors that the government used to arrive at the sum of $210 per year, and who undertook the modelling underpinning that policy decision?

The cost of that is around $1 billion over the forward estimates. I note that the senator is one of the people who have been most strong in their advocacy for recipients of Newstart and for an increase in the Newstart rate, and I congratulate her for participating in that campaign. I thought her involvement on a personal level on that was very impressive. The government have made it clear that we are not of the view that it is appropriate nor fiscally possible to increase the Newstart rate. Nevertheless, we do believe that in times where we can provide some additional assistance to income support recipients we should do so. As part of the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom package not only have we provided a significant amount of assistance to families; we have also included the supplement to which the senator refers.
                                                                  </p>

If you look at the eligibility, for example, for the families package, that is obviously for families who are receiving family tax benefit A, with differential rates for those on the maximum rate, which are obviously families who receive much less income. In terms of the supplement, whilst I appreciate that the senator will continue to advocate for a change in the Newstart rate, that is not the approach that the government is taking. We do believe, at a time when the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.9 per cent, as we have seen today, and remains extremely low, that our focus should be on encouraging participation and bringing more people into the workforce.

The government—I explained to the senator—believed that it was appropriate in the Spreading the Benefits of the Boom package to provide support to low- and middle-income Australia. We included, as a result of those considerations, the supplement to which she refers. I appreciate that her position is that the Newstart rate should be changed. That is not the position of the government. As I have said, the government's first priority is to help people get paid work. We, I think, have demonstrated our commitment to that. If you look at where the unemployment rate is today, if you look at the assistance that is provided to people who are looking for work and if you look at the increased numbers of people over time participating, then I think the policy position is clear.

As I said, I appreciate that the senator does not believe that is appropriate. If she believes it is so inappropriate, perhaps she should advocate for us not to pay it. But we took the view, when we diverted the company tax cut funds and directed those to middle-income and low-income Australia, that it was important for three particular groups to obtain support: families on the lowest incomes, middle-income families and income support recipients. So the government determined the various allocations and increased payments to those groups. That is in the budget. As I said, you are looking at around $1 billion over the forward estimates.
