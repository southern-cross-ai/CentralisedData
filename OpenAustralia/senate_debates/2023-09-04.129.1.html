         I am not actually aware of the suggestions that Senator Roberts is making. I'm a little wary about taking them at face value, because I know Senator Roberts has a certain view of the ABC that is not a view I share. And I'm not sure Senator Roberts has always accurately represented the situation when it comes to the ABC. I would invite Senator Roberts to present further evidence of that, if he has that evidence available.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I will say is that this government is a very strong supporter of the ABC. We recognise that it has a very important role as the national broadcaster. It has an important role not just in our big capital cities but also, particularly, in regional parts of Australia. It is often the only way of having local, regional stories told at the national level, and that's why we are supportive of the ABC. It also plays a very important role during natural disasters as a sort of critical information for people seeking to stay alive during emergencies. They are some of the reasons that we support the ABC, and they are some of the reasons why we were so concerned by the budget cuts that were imposed by the then coalition government on the ABC, because those cuts removed or reduced the ability of the ABC to broadcast those regional stories in some of those areas that Senator Roberts and Senator Hanson like to say they care about. Those cuts reduced the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
          ABC's
         </a>
         ability to provide some of that emergency information that is so vital to rural and regional communities. So we're very proud of the fact that we're strong supporters of the ABC. We don't join in the regular attacks that we see on the ABC from the conservative side of politics, because we think that the institution plays a very important role in our national democracy. We will always remain strong supporters of the ABC.

Why didn't the ABC declare that it was receiving funding from private, foreign organisations and governments for its RMIT fact-checking partnership?

            That's a fair point, Senator Brown. If there were a fact checker for some of the things that come out of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
             One Nation
            </a>
            , they'd be very, very busy. As for Senator Canavan, you wouldn't even start trying to check facts from Senator Canavan. You'd want to have more than a decade if you wanted to check facts from Senator Canavan.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I say, I'm very wary of entering into propositions that are being put by Senator Roberts when it comes to foreign interference and foreign influence. He is prone to saying various things about those issues, which don't always bear fact checking themselves. Again, Senator Roberts, I'd invite you to provide any hard evidence that you have to support the claims that you're making, but I repeat my position that we are strong supporters of the ABC. In fact, I think the public regard the ABC as the most trustworthy news agency in the country. That is regularly shown in surveys.

              The government's Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill does not define the terms 'misinformation' and 'disinformation' in specifics. It would likely be left to biased and foreign influenced fact checkers. Facebook has suspended

                  One Nation
                 </a>
                 parties who say all sorts of things about misinformation. It doesn't seem to prevent them from presenting all sorts of misinformation about certain referendums that we're about to have in this country. It doesn't seem to prevent them joining in on misinformation and disinformation campaigns telling people that we're going to be facing parking tickets being legislated by the Voice and all sorts of nonsense like that. If you want to have a discussion about misinformation, I'd suggest that you keep your own house in order and come to this parliament in good faith rather than providing the constant misinformation we see from the other side.
