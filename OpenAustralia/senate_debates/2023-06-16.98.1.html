        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

         The answer is: we don't support a Canberra based solution. I'm not across the particular project the senator refers to, but I can confirm that, of the package of supports that was contained in the budget for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Central Australia
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Alice Springs
         </a>
         , there is a part of that funding that is unallocated but provision has been made because we want to co-design programs and consult on where those investments should be made with local communities. Part of the work that Minister Burney, Minister McCarthy and others have been doing is working with local communities about programs and how we make sure they're tailored to local need. As I said, I'm not aware of the particular program you raise, Senator, but I'm happy to have a look at any further information I can provide about it.

           () (): That's a pity, given I have spoken about this issue and asked questions in this chamber. The coalition supported this proposal in its final budget, and, as a result of the Labor government's delay in engaging with it, the cost of the project has skyrocketed. Will the Labor government honour the commitment given to the families of

            have received a proposal from the school to construct residential accommodation for students and staff and that the proposal is currently under consideration. I would repeat that we are committed to working with all stakeholders and local communities about how we improve educational outcomes across the region. It is not about imposing a view from Canberra but about working locally for local solutions.

              I understand this project has been shovel-ready for some time and is about protecting vulnerable children from things like sexual abuse. Given that their school is probably the only safe place in the community—and given that this chamber considers the safety of, at least, women in this place—the government should be considering these kids. If the government won't support the Yipirinya community led proposal, what must the people of

               and the Alice and will continue to do so. We have made provisions for extra investments into that region. Some of that's been allocated with agreements and some of it hasn't been, because the work still needs to be done. And I understand that the project the senator refers to, as I said in my previous answer, is under consideration by the National Indigenous Australians Agency and is going through their process as any other project would.
