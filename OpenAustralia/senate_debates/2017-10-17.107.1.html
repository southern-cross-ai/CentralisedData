        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Cash. This morning, Minister Cash shared 'the good news about the impending closure of Holden', which has seen thousands of workers forced to find new jobs or retire. Isn't it clear that nothing has changed since former Treasurer Hockey goaded Holden to leave Australia? Why is the Liberal government celebrating the demise of automotive manufacturing in Australia?

           I thank the senator for the question. I disagree with you. We are certainly not celebrating the demise of the car manufacturing industry in Australia. What we are acknowledging though is that successive governments have provided billions upon billions of dollars to the car industry and, as Senator Carr himself acknowledged when he was the relevant minister, it wasn't the result of any particular government, it was unfortunately—

                 As I stated, the government has for a number of years now been ensuring that we put in place programs to assist those workers working with the relevant states and with the relevant employers to ensure that workers are able to transition into new jobs or new industries. In fact, assistance since 2013 to help businesses transition into new industries is $255 million. Total assistance to assist those workers who have been affected since 2013 is $45 million. The number of workers that have been assisted to date is over 6,000. These workers have been provided with career training, advice and support. In addition to that, Holden advises that 75 per cent of Holden workers have found new jobs or retired. A further 10 per cent of those workers have put their hands up and they have actually said, 'I would like to look at something new,' and they are taking on new study.

                    It is because we are looking to the future. We are looking to ensure that advanced manufacturing in Australia does have a future. All those opposite have done is talk down manufacturing in Australia. What the Turnbull government has done, though, is put in place the policies to help workers transition and to assist our manufacturers to seek lucrative markets both here and overseas. For example, I was very pleased to announce today that companies in both Victoria and

                    Senator Carr, some are in your home state of Victoria. Others are in South Australia. These grants will leverage an additional $89 million from successful applicants. That is a total investment of $119 million—

                      This morning the minister claimed: 'The government stands with you.' When will the minister live up to her words and apologise on behalf of her government for goading Holden to leave and forcing the closure of the Australian automotive manufacturing industry?

                       Senator, you, Senator Carr and others on your side like to blame the coalition government for the closure of auto manufacturers in Australia, but the fact is the fate of Australian auto production was already sealed when Senator Carr himself—he doesn't like to hear this and he doesn't like to take responsibility. Senator Carr, these are the facts. In 2013, when Senator Carr was Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, automotive employment was down one-third from when Labor came into government in 2007. That happens to be a fact, Senator Carr. Motor vehicle production in 2013, when Senator Carr was the relevant minister, was down nearly 40 per cent. In fact, as Senator Carr himself said back in 2012:
