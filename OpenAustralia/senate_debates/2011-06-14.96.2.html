           I thank the Senate. The coalition will not be supporting this motion, for two reasons. Firstly, the time to set up a sovereign wealth fund is when the budget is in surplus and at least government net debt has been paid off. That is exactly what the Howard government did—what
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
            John Howard
           </a>
           and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
            Peter Costello
           </a>
           did—back in 2006. They paid off $96 billion worth of Labor debt. Then, after delivering successive surpluses, they set up the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
            Future Fund
           </a>
           . The Future Fund was exactly that—a sovereign wealth fund. It is true to say that this government has been blessed with the best terms of trade in 140 years. The budget should be in surplus. The budget should be in a much stronger position. Instead we are looking at $107 billion of government net debt—and the government has asked the parliament to raise the debt ceiling by another $50 billion to $250 billion. We are looking at the second highest deficit this financial year. So, unless the Greens are suggesting that the government should borrow in order to invest in a sovereign wealth fund, this is really not the time to go down that path. That would be Greenonomics rather than economics, if we went down that path.
          </p>
          <p>
           Secondly, there are some unresolved issues about the Senate's authority to order the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Productivity Commission
           </a>
           to deliver certain reports. In November last year, the Senate passed an order requiring the Productivity Commission to deliver a report on the anticompetitive, closed shop arrangements that are currently in place in relation to the selection of default superannuation funds under modern awards; we were seeking to implement Labor Party policy.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
            The Senate
           </a>
           ordered the Productivity Commission to deliver a report, with a more open, transparent and competitive process recommended around the selection of default superannuation funds on the modern awards which has still not been delivered—
