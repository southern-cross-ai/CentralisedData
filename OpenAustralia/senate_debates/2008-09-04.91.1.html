        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. The minister would be aware that last Friday the Minister for Resources and Energy took responsibility for the damage an emissions trading scheme could do to industries in his portfolio, and he consequently convened a summit of companies that could be forced to shut down or to shed jobs because of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">
         ETS
        </a>
        . I ask the minister: when is he going to take similar responsibility for the impact on our manufacturing sector of a rushed and poorly designed emissions trading scheme, and when is he going to call a summit of manufacturing companies to talk these issues through?

           . Senator Macdonald starts from a fundamentally flawed proposition in attacking Mr Ferguson. He unfortunately has fallen for the old trap of believing what he reads in newspaper headlines. He has some fundamental problems in understanding these basic principles. What has occurred is that this government, right across the board, is consulting with industry. The government is ensuring that the fundamental challenges faced by this country in regard to climate change are addressed squarely, because what we had was 12 years of neglect and 12 years of negligence from those opposite in regard to facing up to the responsibilities this country has had to deal with on issues of climate change.
          </p>
          <p>
           Before the release of the green paper, of course, there was discussion with industry and after the release of the green paper there has also been discussion with industry. Australia’s heavy manufacturing industries such as aluminium and steel are significant contributors to the Australian economy. As a consequence I have established working groups within my department, which have been operating for several months dealing with these matters on a daily basis. The level of consultation with industry and the level of access has probably been greater with this government than they were in the last 12 years of the previous government.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course one acknowledges that heavy industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas in this country. So it is appropriate that the introduction of a national emissions trading scheme ahead of global carbon constraint may, of course, affect the competitiveness of emissions-intensive, trade-exposed heavy manufacturing industries in Australia. That is why we are providing the certainty necessary for these industries to be able to make the adjustments. We are providing the certainty that is necessary to attract new investment and to provide opportunities for increased employment in this country. And of course we are committed to ensuring that Australia—

             <p>
              The question is: how does an advanced industrial economy like ours adjust to the challenges of climate change? The answer—it is a pity the opposition does not understand this—is to attract new investment, to find new technologies, to develop new processes and to ensure that our industries are able to meet these challenges head-on and maintain their international competitiveness. We will establish a
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
               Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
              </a>
              that will provide the certainty to enable industry to invest in long-lived assets like power stations and of course steel plants. Taking the lead ahead of some countries we understand how important it is not to undermine competitiveness. In fact we understand that climate change is a global challenge and the design of the scheme, as Senator Wong has outlined, will address the competitive challenges facing emissions-intensive trade-exposed firms. We will work in partnership with energy-intensive industries on research and development and on the application of new technologies to reduce emissions wherever possible.
