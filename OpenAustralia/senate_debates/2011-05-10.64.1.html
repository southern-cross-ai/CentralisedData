          Villawood staff said the fire and bomb was reported to the department but no action was taken because it was classed as a minor incident.

          If a fire resulting from a bomb is considered a minor incident generating no action, what would the minister consider a major incident that required action?

           police took possession of what they have referred to as a bomb. Importantly, the department did act appropriately in calling the fire brigade in the first instance and then alerting the police, who are now investigating the incident. Whether the device was actually a bomb or not is a matter for police investigation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The fire was discovered and extinguished by Serco officers at 3.20 am on Saturday, 19 March 2011. Local emergency services were immediately called. The New South Wales police attended at approximately—

             , on the point of order. It is clearly appropriate for Senator Carr, as a representing minister, to provide information from the brief he has from the responsible minister. It is directly on the topic that Senator Cash addressed to him. She has two supplementary questions to follow up with if she wishes further inform­ation. But he has been directly on the topic, providing what information he has about the incident, and it is quite outrageous to suggest that he is not being relevant. If there are other matters that are not covered in his primary answer, the senator has the opportunity to ask two supplementary questions. Senator Carr is being as helpful as he can be by providing the information that is supplied to him.

               , I have been asked by Senator Cash about an incident that occurred at the centre on 19 March 2011. I am providing information. She has sought to rely on a newspaper report of the allegations as to what occurred on this occasion. I have provided information to the Senate on the basis of the information that has been provided to me by the minister. What I can indicate is that the

               police are making inquiries into the nature of the events that occurred and that no person of interest in relation to the incident has been identified at this stage. The department advised the minister's office of the fire at the time but not of the discovery of the device or that the police had taken it for examination as possible evidence. In terms of what the senator seeks to assert is a matter of priority, that is entirely hypothetical.

Why was the minister not aware of the homemade bomb and what steps has the minister taken to ensure he remains fully informed on the vital issues within his portfolio?

                <p>
                 In terms of the radio interview, the minister has already expressed his view that it was unacceptable that he was not informed of the discovery of the device, and he has made his concerns very clear to the department about the discovery of this homemade incendiary. The minister has instructed the secretary of the department to investigate why he was not informed and ensure that this does not happen in the future. There is not much more I can add to assist Senator Cash in that matter.

                   What I have indicated is that whether this device was actually a bomb or something other than that is the subject of an ongoing police inquiry. The fire that was the subject of the incident itself was discovered and extinguished by Serco officers at 3.20 in the morning. The local emergency services were called immediately. The

                   police attended at 4 am and they took possession of what is now referred to as a bomb and returned later in daylight hours to take photographs. No person of interest has actually been identified at this stage as a result of the police inquiry. The department did not advise the minister at the time and the department secretary has been instructed to find out why not.

                    My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Senator Carr. The Malaysian High Commissioner today declared that Australia cannot simply dictate which people will be sent to Malaysia under the Gillard government's Malaysian solution. Will the Malaysian government officials come to Australia to select which asylum seekers they will take or will it simply be conducted through paperwork? How will the Malaysian government decide who is sent to their country?

                     I thank the senator for her question. The government has announced that the Australian and Malaysian governments have committed to enter into a landmark transfer agreement under the regional cooperative framework and that this process undermines the efforts of people smugglers to seek to encourage people to undertake very risky journeys to Australia. This in fact is a new initiative to ensure that we are able to take all the necessary steps to highlight the extra­ordinary dangers of undertaking such a voyage and to indicate to people that this is a counterproductive move and is unlikely to produce the results that people are looking for in terms of finding settlement here, because people will be sent to Malaysia, from which many of them come originally, and will be placed at the back of the queue.

                         will be involved in the processes involving the Malaysian government. The reports today that the Malaysian High Commissioner is wanting the right to refuse people entry are inaccurate and misleading. While the government cannot comment on the specifics of current diplomatic negotiations, the reports that appeared today are incorrect. What I would have thought the Greens would be particularly interested in is that, for the first time, the UNHCR is involved in terms of the Malaysian government, a point which the UNHCR have made and indicated is a matter of some significance to them. The public comments by their spokesperson have highlighted that fact.

                                   , the minister is flagrantly defying your ruling. You pulled him up when he went completely away from the answer to the question and started politically attacking the Liberal Party. You pulled him up and he has treated your ruling with complete contempt.

                                     There is no point of order in that, in that Senator Brandis simply wants to re-agitate an issue. Of course, that gives him using a point of order as a platform to challenge your ruling. This matter is a matter for the President and the President has ruled on the matter and therefore there is no point of order.

My question, as you have accepted and twice pulled the minister up, was clearly about the date upon which this took effect. It did not ask anything about the Liberal Party; it did not ask anything about philosophies or policies. I simply want to know the date on which this will take effect.

                                          . What I have indicated is that the government will finalise the agreement with Malaysia in the coming weeks, depending on resolution of certain operational matters. I also indicated that it was a bit rich to argue the toss about increasing the humanitarian target, which we are quite proud of, when the Liberal Party during the last election sought to increase it to 15,000 and double it in their conversations when they were trying to secure a majority in the House of Repre­sentatives—a proposition which would have cost $3 billion. That was the claim when they were discussing the matter with Mr Wilkie—$3 billion to get one vote. And they want to argue the toss about increasing slightly the refugee intake numbers that we are doing at the moment! We see here a little of hypocrisy even by Liberal Party standards that sinks to new depths.

                                              , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for saying initially that they were in the process of developing arrangements and later then saying that it would be a number of weeks, dependent upon certain operational matters. Thank you, Minister. What this really means is that we have no idea—it could be weeks, months, years. So I asked the minister: what additional steps is the government proposing to stop the flood of boat arrivals who will try to get in in that interregnum—that one week, three months, two years or whatever it is—until this arrangement is finalised?

                                                , I ask a further supplementary question. I thank the minister.

                                                 What I can draw Senator Macdonald's attention to is—and I am not quite sure what the nature of the question was—is the fact that the government will be working with the government of Malaysia to ensure that we are able to treat people properly and, as the

                                                 has indicated, that the nature of this agreement, a bilateral agreement, has been negotiated within the broader regional context with the involve­ment of the UNHCR and with the involve­ment of the International Organi­sation for Migration. This is the first time this has happened with respect to Malaysia and we hope that there will be other important actors as well, which will include non-government organisations. So there is a real opportunity here, an opportunity to deal with these issues in a humane and fair but firm way to ensure that the agreement between this government and other countries involved in refugee issues are treated properly.
