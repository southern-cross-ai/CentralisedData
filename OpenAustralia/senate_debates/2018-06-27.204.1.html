        Several key policy elements in the Bill result from public feedback given during a review of 'the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 and Australia's consideration of ratification of the

        Subject to consultation with the relevant coastal State, this Bill enables the protection of underwater cultural heritage significant to Australia that is located outside of Australian jurisdictional waters, such as

        Other policy elements, continuing from the 1976 Act, include: the capacity to give effect to the

       <p class="italic">
        All shipwrecks that have been underwater for 75 years remain protected and this level of protection will now be extended to sunken aircraft and their associated articles. Shipwrecks and aircraft that have been underwater less than 75 years, and other types of underwater cultural heritage, can be protected through individual declaration based on an assessment of heritage significance.

       <p class="italic">
        Consistent with recommendations from the 2015 review of the
        <i>
         Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986
        </i>
        , this Bill enables the regulation of Australian and foreign persons in regards to importing and exporting protected underwater cultural heritage.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In line with the Government's commitment to minimising regulatory burden, this Bill simplifies the sale or transfer of protected articles by introducing a transferable permit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also aligns with Government compliance policy, strengthening and broadening the range of investigation and enforcement powers, and includes a graduated approach to compliance and enforcement to better protect underwater cultural sites.
