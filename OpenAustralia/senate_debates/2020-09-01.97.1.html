        [by video link] My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. Does the minister agree with the counsel assisting the aged care royal commission, Mr Peter Rozen
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">

         The government and the health officers, the

          CHO
         </a>
         s, from around the country were all very well aware that senior Australians were extremely vulnerable to this terrible virus, COVID-19. We all very much knew that it could have a devastating impact. We all knew that. That's why in our plan to deal with COVID-19 in this country, including in aged care, the national COVID-19 healthcare plan, aged care was a significant component. That's why the AHPPC put that document together, to support the government's response to COVID-19 across the country, including in aged care, supported by the guidelines provided by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDNA" rel="nofollow">
          CDNA
         </a>
         to the aged-care sector. It was all part of our plan to deal with COVID-19 across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         So from the beginning of the year, from January, we started working closely with the aged-care sector, providing advice on how providers would improve their infection control plans, how they should upgrade their procedures with respect to the utilisation of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
          PPE
         </a>
         and how they should upgrade the plans within their facilities so they could be prepared in the circumstance of an outbreak.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission also started working with providers to test their preparedness. So, yes, we were well aware of the vulnerabilities of the aged-care sector and of those who reside within it, very well aware. That's why our plan, right from the outset, contemplated a number of actions, based on the AHPPC advice through the COVID-19 health management plan that was issued during February.

           [by video link] Given the warnings of Dorothy Henderson Lodge in March and Newmarch House in April, why did the minister still wait until June to advise aged-care providers that 80 to 100 per cent of their workforce might need to isolate in a major outbreak?

What we saw as the pandemic proceeded was the circumstance at Newmarch, where that number grew significantly. In fact, even the report into Newmarch that we received said that that level of staff isolation was not contemplatedâ€”couldn't be.

                 I completely reject the premise of the question. We acted very quickly to bolster the aged-care workforce through the surge capacity we announced on 11 March this year. So we acted very quickly. Before Dorothy Henderson Lodge was over, we acted extremely quickly because we saw what had happened. We had received the advice of the AHPPC, so we put in place over $100 million in capacity for surge workforce early in March. So I completely reject the premise of the question. We acted quickly to make sure that resources were available to residential aged care in this country so that any facility that was impacted had the capacity to be supported by the government in the form that it needed to continue to provide quality care.

                  My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. How many residents of aged-care facilities funded and regulated by the Morrison government have passed away from COVID-19? How many active cases of COVID-19 are there currently in Australia's aged-care system?

                              , the minister told the Senate he first realised he hadn't got it right. He said:

                                 She makes a very, very unfortunate and, I think, dishonest correlation between the circumstances at St Basil'sâ€”the government has acknowledged that, with 24 hours notice, we didn't have in place the staffing requirements to replace the entire staff of that facility, and there were some things that occurred there that we would have wished had not occurred.
