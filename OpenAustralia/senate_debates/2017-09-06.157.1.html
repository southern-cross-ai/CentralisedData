        Elderly Australians have contributed valiantly to society, and throughout their lives have helped make Australia the great country it is. They have worked, volunteered, paid taxes and raised families. Some have been to war, and many live with the scars. Unfortunately, many of these Australians who have given so much to society are highly vulnerable, and are not currently guaranteed the standard of care they deserve within our aged care facilities.

        , Queensland and Victoria prescribe staffing requirements for some residential aged care facilities, but all elderly Australians deserve the best level of care when they can no longer live independently, and instead rely on others for their health, protection and wellbeing.

        It's hardly surprising that international research suggests that higher

        s) over the last decade or more. In 2016 the average total care hours worked per resident per day were 2.9 hours.

        This
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Bill
        </a>
        introduces the concept of a mandated ratio of skilled staff to care recipients in Australia's aged care residential facilities. The task of calculating a safe and specific ratio (including providing for variables such as day and night shifts, higher and lower care residents, and for metropolitan, rural and regional areas) should be undertaken by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        in consultation with the aged care sector, and included in the Quality of Care Principles.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The passage of this Bill would be an important step in moving towards an aged care system that is more focussed on the protection of the elderly than on profit margins of aged care facilities.
