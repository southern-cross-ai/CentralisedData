         I would like to thank Senator Seselja for his interest in the positive work that is being undertaken in this area. There are many unsung heroes working in the community. Today, I would like to congratulate Aboriginal Hostels Limited,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHL" rel="nofollow">
          AHL

         , for 40 years of continuous service to Aboriginal and

         Australians. It opened its first hostel in Yumba in Brisbane in 1974. It is now operating a national network of accommodation facilities. It has over 2,000 beds available to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         each night of the year. AHL provides safe, affordable, culturally appropriate accommodation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who need to be away from home to access services. In meeting Indigenous Australians in urban, regional and remote Australia, many of them relate to me their stories and fond memories of being away from home spending time in AHL hostels. Whether that was to attend school or training, whether they were looking for work or accessing health and medical services, it is clear that the contribution these hostels have made and are continuing to make is a strong and lasting one. The company also makes a contribution through its 11 medical facilities for those requiring renal dialysis and general medical and antenatal care. I take this opportunity to congratulate AHL on their 40 years in business. There is no point governments of all types providing services when people cannot access those services because of the impediment of a lack of accommodation.

            Torres Strait Islander
           </a>
           Australians, providing development opportunities in tourism, catering and other areas of the hospitality industry. AHL has the highest proportion of Indigenous employees of any Australian government organisation at some 73 per cent of their employees. One particular story is very noteworthy. A student from the remote community of Doon Doon in north-west Australia who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy has never let his condition affect his life. The tough decision was made that he should leave home and move to the hostel in Kununurra to complete school. I understand this has been a fantastic decision. This particular student is now excelling at the school. He has rarely missed a day and is determined to complete year 12. Again, congratulations to AHL.

             has undertaken to work with the government to meet our key priorities in education, employment and creating safer communities. It is interesting to note that their new strategic plan from 2014 to 2017 will ensure that a consistent standard of service excellence applies right across those 2,000 beds every night in Australia. It will also increase focus on opportunities for new and innovative approaches to support through-life opportunities where they are needed most. One of the greatest tests of a program or a facility is to think: if you took that away, what would happen? Sadly, sometimes that is nothing, but certainly in the case of AHL it is significant. The Trilby Cooper facility in Kalgoorlie needed to undergo some renovations for a period and sadly many were adversely affected during that time, but I am very pleased to say that the facility reopened on 14 July, indicating what an absolutely essential service this is.
