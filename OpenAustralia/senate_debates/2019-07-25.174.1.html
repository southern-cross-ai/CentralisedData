        My question is to Senator Birmingham, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Energy. Whilst trying to justify his decision to vote for the government to protect Minister Taylor, Senator Patrick today said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        â€¦ I've been shown evidence that Minister Taylor was asked to make representation on behalf of some constituents.
       </p>
       <p>
        What evidence was Senator Patrick referring to? Will the minister undertake to table a copy in the Senate?

           Perhaps you might wish to talk to Senator Cormann. Minister Taylor's brother is a director of Jam Land Pty Ltd, the company in which Minister Taylor has a financial interest and which owns land at the centre of the allegations against Minister Taylor. Was Minister Taylor's brother one of the constituents who raised concerns with Minister Taylor?

            If there's anything further to add in relation to constituent representations I'll bring that back to the chamber. As I have stated to the chamber before, very clearly, Minister Taylor's interest in Guffee Pty Ltd has been declared appropriately on the register of members' interests. His interest in Jam Land Pty Ltd is held indirectly through that interest in Guffee Pty Ltd, but is certainly a matter of the public record.

              The meeting that took place following representations by Minister Taylor, then Minister Frydenberg's office and members of the Department of the Environment and Energy was revealed as a result of documents released under freedom of information. Can this minister explain why the evidence Senator Patrick referred to earlier today as a basis of justifying his protection, with the government, of Minister Taylor was not released or referred to in any part of that freedom of information request?

               That of course depends on what the scope of that freedom of information request was. Having taken the first and primary question on notice, if there's anything that informs an answer to that further I will bring that back to the chamber, too, Senator Wong.
