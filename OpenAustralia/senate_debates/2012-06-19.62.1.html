        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to the fact that Australia has the world's third largest ocean territory, at 8.5 million square kilometres, but from our territory we extract less than 30 kilograms of marine catch per square kilometre. Because of this we import 70 per cent of our seafood from other nations. We import the most from Thailand, who extract almost 6,000 kilograms of marine catch from their oceans—more than 200 times the rate of our extraction. Why is the government simply exporting an environmental issue to another country by further shutting down Australia's fishing industry through its declaration of 1.3 million square kilometres of marine reserve parks? And what guarantees can the government give that the lower fishing production in Australia will not simply be displaced to other countries with a less enviable environmental record?

         : at the risk of making a habit of this, the minister for fisheries, Minister Ludwig, is in the chamber and, quite frankly, is probably better placed to answer that question as most of it goes to Fisheries. Senator Conroy is happy to take it but, as the fisheries minister is—

         The question was all about fisheries catch and the impact on the fishing industry. But if you would rather have an answer from Senator Conroy, in representing the environment minister, we are very relaxed. I was just trying to help Senator Boswell.

           can help the fishing industry! But for generations Australians have understood the need to preserve precious areas on land as national parks. Our oceans contain unique marine life which needs protection too. We have an incredible opportunity to turn the tide on protection of the oceans and Australia can lead the world in marine protection. The government's network of marine reserves is the most comprehensive network of marine protected areas in the world and represents the largest addition to the conservation estate in Australia's history. This new network of marine reserves will help ensure that Australia's diverse marine environment and the life it supports will remain healthy, productive and resilient for future generations. The development of a national system of marine reserves has been underway in Australia for 20 years since the signing of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment in 1992. A national agreement to establish a national representative system of marine protected areas was reached in 1998 by Commonwealth, state and territory environmental ministers meeting under the chairmanship of the then federal environment minister, Senator

              , I have a supplementary question. I refer the minister to the ABARES fisheries status report. On page 52 of that report there is a table reporting the status of fish stocks in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Sea" rel="nofollow">
               Coral Sea

              and it says not one fish species is listed as overfished. Why then is the government locking up the Coral Sea from all fishing? Can the minister name one fish species that is currently threatened from overfishing other than the commercial fishermen?

                As I was saying, there is a representative system of marine protected areas in Commonwealth waters. They are the guidelines by which the marine reserves are being identified. The guidelines were set out in the bioregional profile for the south-west marine region, a document released by the then Minister for the Environment and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
                 Water Resources
                </a>
                , Mr Malcolm Turnbull. But there is recognition, too, that marine reserves are not the only way to protect a marine environment and they must work in tandem with effective fisheries management, where Australia is an acknowledged leader, and the effective regulation of other marine industries. It would be unfair of me not to acknowledge the contribution in this area of the then fisheries minister, Senator Abetz, who was also involved in many of these initiatives. Perhaps you have not met him recently.

Can the minister justify why the government's announced policy is almost a carbon copy of the Greens Coral Sea policy announced at the last election, which proposed a Coral Sea marine reserve which was no-take, with only two specific zones open to recreational fishing?
