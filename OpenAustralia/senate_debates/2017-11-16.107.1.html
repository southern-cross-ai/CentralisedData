        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. Yesterday the ABC reported that as part of Operation Manitou, the

         I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for his question. Australia is part of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         -led Combined Maritime Forces, as you would be aware, in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         and has been for a number of years. In fact,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Newcastle
         </i>
         , which I believe to be the vessel that you're referring to, is the 65th rotation in which Australia is participating in the Combined Maritime Forces.
        </p>
        <p>
         When the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMF" rel="nofollow">
          CMF
         </a>
         is active and the members thereof are active, it's a 32-nation US-led partnership. It's focused on countering terrorism, on preventing piracy, on encouraging regional cooperation and on promoting a safe maritime environment in international waters. When participants in the Combined Maritime Forces are active, they engage opportunistically, as it were, from time to time in joint activities such as the one to which Senator Whish-Wilson refers. That is the basis upon which the engagement occurred between Australia and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" rel="nofollow">
          Saudi Arabia
         </a>
         and their respective navies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our contribution to maritime security in the Middle East region does not include enforcement of any blockade on Yemen. We are in no way involved in that process. I'm not aware of the status of the correspondence from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">

Seven million people are on the brink of starvation and more than 50,000 children are expected to die of cholera this year alone. What is the Australian government's position on the Saudi blockade, and will you take this opportunity today to condemn the blockade and this impending human rights catastrophe?

            I have sought advice from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to this issue. Senator Whish-Wilson is indeed correct when he refers to the United Nations' concerns that have been raised in relation to the situation in Yemen as a very significant humanitarian crisis. Australia has made contributions to support in Yemen since the beginning of this year. Minister Bishop announced the most recent contribution of $10 million on 16 September. That assistance has helped to deliver food, health care, water and sanitation to the many people who are in need of urgent assistance.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are also contributing to the humanitarian response in Yemen through our funding of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
             UN

            Central Emergency Response Fund. We've provided $33 million to UN

            , as it is known, over the past three years, which has helped UN CERF provide $20 million in 2016 and $60 million in 2015 to Yemen. We have urged all those engaged in the conflict—

                   led negotiations aiming for a permanent end to the hostilities. Australian officials have made representations to the parties to the conflict regarding the importance of allowing unhindered humanitarian access and the need to respect international humanitarian law. In relation to the position of the ADF, Australia does not conduct operations in Yemeni territorial waters or Yemini airspace. Nor do we currently have a defence relationship with—

                     It is a point of order on relevance. I've waited until 18 seconds are left to go. My question was very clear: were there discussions within Defence and between government about the dangers of conducting this exercise now, with a blockade going on that's forcing the starvation of seven million people?

                      Senator, please don't restate the question. Again I make the point—and we had an example earlier in the week—that, when there are prefaces to questions, ministers are allowed to address the preface to the question as well as the final words of the question.
