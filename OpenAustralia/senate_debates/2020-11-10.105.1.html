        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. Can the minister advise the Senate on how the Liberal-National government's strong budget management is delivering vital capability to our

         I thank Senator Abetz for that question, and I also thank him for his tireless commitment to the ADF. Protecting our nation's security and also our nation's sovereignty are essential preconditions for our nation's prosperity. The Morrison government is investing over $270 billion in Australia's defence capability over the next decade alone. This is the biggest investment in the ADF's capability in many generations. This investment is meeting the challenge of our region's rapidly changing and also deteriorating strategic environment. As Minister for Defence, my focus is now on ensuring Defence delivers the three new strategic objectives we have set themâ€”that is, to shape, to deter and to respond.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm particularly proud our government has restored the defence budget to two per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         , achieving a commitment we made in 2013. Defence and defence industry now have the certainty, the funding and also the road map they need to deliver the 2020 Force Structure Plan. The defence budget is also providing an important contribution to the Australian economy and to Australian jobs. Over 15,000 companies now support defence, and that is over 70,000 Australian workers. That number is increasing, even during COVID-19 this year. We've got a $1 billion COVID-economic-recovery package supporting 4,000 Australian jobs, and our local industry capability plans are now awarding 73 per cent of infrastructure work to local businesses. Defence, through the leadership of this government, is rising to the challenge to build a stronger nation and provide an important and enduring contribution to our nation's economy.

            I thank Senator Abetz again for that question. Since the
            <i>
             2016 Defence white paper
            </i>
            , this government has approved more than 400 capability decisions worth over $122 billion. We are building a stronger nation by bolstering Australia's defence capability. This is backed by real funding with a belief, an absolute belief, in Australian companies and in Australian workers. The Morrison government's national security agenda unashamedly puts Australia's defence capability first for now and for many decades to come. Unlike those opposite in government, we are getting on with the job. We are building over 70 ships in Australia, we are manufacturing hundreds of combat vehicles in Queensland, and, as I said, we are supporting the jobs of over 70,000 Australians. Australians can trust this government to deliver the ADF capability we need.

               I certainly can. It is critically important to make sure that defence and defence industry in this nation have funding and program certainty, because that allows us to back in our defence strategy with credible force. It allows us to maintain our capability edge and it also allows us to invest in a far more resilient Australian sovereign industrial base here, right in Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let us never ever forget the legacy we inherited from those opposite in 2013. Under those opposite's two white papers, they stripped out $18 billion from the defence budget. The defence budget was cut to its lowest level since 1938, to 1.56 per cent of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
                GDP
               </a>
               . Not only did they take $18 billion out; they cut, delayed and cancelled 170 capabilities: deployable health, Collins sonar upgrades and maritime strike weapons. Under them, not a single submarineâ€”
