        I rise with sadness this evening to offer my condolences to the Scanlon family of the north-west coast of Tasmania for the loss of their daughter, Kate, who on Tuesday was the victim of a tragic train accident in India. Kate was one of four Tasmanians who had travelled to India seeking new experiences. On their way to the holy city of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodh_Gaya" rel="nofollow">
         Bodh Gaya
        </a>
        , two coaches of the train caught alight. In the ensuing fire, seven people were killed, including Kate. Kate was a beautiful and vibrant 21-year-old who moved from her home of Forth on the north-west coast of Tasmania to Melbourne to pursue her studies in physiotherapy. Her loss diminishes us all.
       </p>
       <p>
        With Kate were three other Tasmanians. My thoughts are with their families, and my hopes for a quick and safe repatriation home. This group of young women are like so many young Australians. Driven by curiosity, wonder and excitement for a world that has opened up to them in the early years of their adulthood, they were simply looking to explore. And like so many Australians—our country has such a reputation for travelling the globe—they wanted to taste some of the culture that makes our world such an amazing place. Tasmania is a close community, the north-west of our state most of all. I know that in this difficult time for the families of these young women they will be supported by their friends and neighbours, and I am sure I speak for all my Tasmanian colleagues when I say that our thoughts are with them.
