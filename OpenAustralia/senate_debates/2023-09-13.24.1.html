          The opposition has already made their position clear in relation to the Housing Australia
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
           Future Fund
          </a>
          Bill 2023, and that is that we're not supporting it for the reasons that have been articulated on many occasions. But I am particularly keen to understand from the government exactly where the Housing Affordability Future Fund and associated bills actually are in terms of the financial commitments and the other commitments that have been made by the government in order for them to be able to seek the support of the necessary number of people in this chamber for the passage of these bills. Clearly, they have been able to do that, otherwise we wouldn't be standing here today.
         </p>
         <p>
          We started off during the election with a $10 billion fund that was supposed to generate $500 million per year to go towards certain housing. We're not exactly sure about what that housing is because there doesn't appear to be any definition in the bill about what particular types of housing products actually are. Subsequent to the election commitment of a $10 billion off-balance-sheet, financially engineered, weird fund, we've seen a $2 billion commitment to the states and territories that was made some time ago in relation to housing, and this week we saw that the government has agreed to an additional $1 billion package in order to secure the Greens' support for this. So we now have a $13 billion housing fund. As we stand here today, we haven't even passed this legislation through this place. We have seen a 30 per cent blowout in the cost of this fund, and the legislation has not even been voted on yet.
         </p>
         <p>
          What I am very keen to understand from the Minister is: is $13 billion all that has been committed to the passage of this piece of legislation, or have there been other deals done that we are unaware of? The reason I'm asking that is that I noticed yesterday and the day before, when the Greens made their statements publicly about their intent to now support this particular bill, that the Greens shadow housing spokesperson representative—or whatever they call them in the Greens—Mr Chandler-Mather made some comments in relation to some commitments he was seeking in relation to rent-capping. The first question I'd like to ask the Minister is: has the government made any commitments in relation to supporting rent-capping in order to get the support of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Greens
          </a>
          for the passage of this particular piece of legislation through this place?

           I think the simplest way of answering the question is to say that the additional commitment that has been made over the course of the last few days and week is an additional $1 billion. The commitment that the government made earlier this year was in the context of the national cabinet discussions, and that was very public. I think everybody understands what the nature of that commitment was.

            Unfortunately, I don't think everybody does understand the nature of some of the deals that have been done, because, I've got to say, transparency doesn't seem to be a hallmark of this government. Whatever dirty deals that were done with the Greens in order to support this, I note that the Minister said the support was a $1 billion package. I wonder if you are able to provide details of what that $1 billion package actually looks like so the Australian public can get some sort of understanding about what the government is prepared to pay for in order to get these particular bills through this place.

               The only arrangements the government has made will be reflected in the amendments that are before the Senate. The government has made a range of agreements in terms of issues like accessibility issues that will be reflected in the amendments and the voting position of the government in relation to those questions. Beyond the publicly available measures that the government has identified, there are no other measures—and not in relation to particular states, beyond what has been publicly available.

                      That's really good news, because clearly the Australian public deserve to know the basis behind any of these deals. But obviously the proof of the accuracy of those responses will be in any decisions that get taken into the future in relation to those really important issues. We know the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                       Australian Labor Party
                      </a>
                      went to the election making a whole heap of promises to the Australian public about their behaviour, and subsequent to the election we have only seen them change their mind and backflip on so many of these things. The Australian public should be very concerned about the willingness of this government, what it's prepared to do, when it needs to get some piece of legislation through.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The reality is that as we're standing here today we've got a piece of legislation that we know is faulty—and I'll ask some questions of the minister in relation to that in a minute. We know it's a really dodgy piece of legislation, because if the government was really determined to put through and provide additional funding to this type of housing then why on Earth is it not on the balance sheet? That is the question every Australian taxpayer should be asking: why have they gone and engineered this weird financial instrument, which is only ever used in quite extreme circumstances like the future fund? Why on Earth have they put it off balance sheet, particularly at a time when they're making a whole heap of commitments in relation to the amount of money that's going to be expended each year as a result of this particular fund? Yet anybody who's done economics 101 would understand that what the government is promising here is not able to be delivered.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      To that end, Minister: during your second reading concluding remarks you made a commitment that $500 million would be disbursed every year, plus indexation. First of all, I believe it was a funding cap of $500 million. In your contribution, Minister, you were quite clear that $500 million would be disbursed every year. So, I'm just seeking clarification from you: is it a funding cap of up to $500 million a year? Or is it that, as you said in your second reading statement, $500 million a year plus indexation will be disbursed every year subsequent to 2024?

                       There was a range of questions in there that went to, firstly, the bona fides of the government's arrangements that have been made in order to collaborate with colleagues on the crossbench to ensure the support of this legislation. The government has been completely transparent about those matters, entirely consistent with the government's approach on not just a range of issues that you raised there but on all the issues. Senators and the public can be absolutely confident that the arrangements that the government has reached are entirely public and entirely transparent. That stands in contrast to the efforts that were made in the passage of pieces of legislation over the course of the last three unhappy governments, and it stands in contrast to the secret arrangements that the Liberals have with the Nationals, which is never revealed. It is kept locked tight in a crypt somewhere over there in somebody's office. So we won't be lectured about transparency in relation to the arrangements here. There will be a series of amendments that will be dealt with by the Senate. The government's voting decisions on that will be entirely public.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I think your second broadly grouped set of questions, Senator
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruston" rel="nofollow">

                       , went to the nature of the fund itself. This is not an unusual arrangement. It's a very similar arrangement to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the National Reconstruction Fund, the medical research fund—I'm not calling it by its proper name, but I think we know the fund that I mean—and the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
                        Future Fund
                       </a>
                       established by Mr Costello and Mr Howard. These are all allocations of funds that are designed to earn income in perpetuity, essentially—unless the parliament changes its approach to those funds—and to provide a source of income that is dedicated to a particular public policy purpose. The public policy purpose that is set out here is to build affordable homes to lift the supply of housing for low-income Australians who are experiencing housing stress. That is the public purpose. That is what that income will be allocated to.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In agreement with the crossbench, in order to be absolutely clear about what is going to be provided here, there is a minimum $500 million disbursement. As I've discussed, it may, of course, be more. If the income of the fund is higher, it is open to the fund to allocate more. There are arrangements that are dealt with in the second reading speech that go to the reviews and the capacity of those amounts to be adjusted over time for indexation purposes and other purposes.

                          I'm keen to understand what would happen in circumstances where the fund doesn't make a profit. Last year, for example, the fund wouldn't have made a profit, based on the information that's been provided in relation to how the fund might work—but we haven't seen the fund's mandate, so we actually are still a bit in the dark about exactly how you're going to run this fund. Minister, we know that there could be a situation where the fund actually loses money. There are quite clearly many opportunities for a fund of this nature not necessarily to make a five per cent return—a net return, because of course we have to pay interest on this fund before we actually start drawing any benefit from it. So I'm keen to understand: what is the mechanism for the guaranteeing of $500 million per year plus indexation? In circumstances where the fund does not generate the necessary $500 million, where is the money coming from?

                           . The mechanism is that the legislation provides for a minimum $500 million disbursement. The nature of these kinds of funds, of which there are many in Australia and around the world, is that they have investment objectives and are designed to exist for a very long period of time. The investment objectives are set with regard to what is an expected and reasonable rate of return. The government will monitor the operations of this fund closely, as I'm sure the government of the Howard and Costello period monitored the operations of the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">

                           </a>
                           . That fund also had requirements it had to meet in relation to the superannuation obligations that the fund was designed to provide for. Subsequent governments—the Rudd and Gillard governments and the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments—have all had a responsibility to monitor the performance of those funds over time.

                            Thank you for the history lecture, but I was quite keen to understand something specifically from you, Minister, with specific reference to this particular fund. In the circumstances where the fund does not make a profit sufficient to enable the full $500 million disbursement to be made out of the profits, how will the fund provide those disbursements?

                             It will provide the minimum disbursements in the event that the rate of return that is anticipated is not met in any given year. That minimum disbursement will be made over the long term. As is the nature of all these funds, the investment objectives will be met over time. That is in the nature of all these funding arrangements. They are not novel, and they're certainly not new to governments of various persuasions that have administered these funds over the course of many decades.

                              Thank you, Minister, but I don't know that I can be much clearer. How will the funds that are going to be disbursed be provided for in the absence of the fund providing them? Are they going to be disbursed from the $10 billion? Are they going to be provided through other government appropriations or other budgetary mechanisms? If we do not have sufficient profit made in a particular year, where will the funds come from?

                                 That same question could be directed to a range of these funds that are allocated for these purposes. That is why, indeed, the amount that the government has allocated to the fund is the $10 billion amount. It is designed to be an amount sufficient to meet the publicly stated purpose of the fund—that is, to disburse a minimum of $500 million every year. A significant upfront credit of $10 billion provides an enduring source of funding for social and affordable homes. You would anticipate that the nature of setting investment objectives is that the task of the fund is to meet the investment objectives. It is also true to say that no matter what the investment vehicle is, public or private, that investment objectives are not always met in any given year. That's why, in order to provide clarity here about the fund's capacity to meet its public policy objectives, a $500 million allocation is made.

                                     or AYRES (—) (): Thank you for repeating that. The draft investment mandate will be released over the course of the coming weeks—not months. It will be in draft form and there will be a consultation process to provide not just visibility of the government intentions in terms of the draft mandate but also an opportunity for stakeholders to engage with the government if there's a view that any amendments ought to be sought.

                                       Of course, the decision for a minimum $500 million annual disbursement from next year and the decisions around the investment mandate all come together. The government has sought a range of advice, including about setting an appropriate level to achieve the government 's objective here, which is a minimum of 30,000 homes being built over the course of the next five years. That's the objective, and the government sought a range of advice, as you would expect.

                                         I think a question about the government providing modelling and advice to cabinet meets with a predictable response—I recall asking a similar question a few years ago and meeting what I thought was a stonewall from former Minister Cormann. The government has sought a range of advice in making decisions around the drafting of this legislation in our discussions with the crossbench and stakeholders as the Senate committee proceeded, in order to meet our public policy objectives.

                                             It is clear in the budget that those expenses in relation to providing the $10 billion allocation are provided for in the budget in the normal way, in the way that all other expenditures of the government are provided for in a budget context. Of course, the May budget is a budget in which the government has returned to surplus—not a projected one, but a real one. All of the allocations that the government has made are there for everybody to see in the context of the budget. We didn't project a surplus and then not deliver it; we delivered a surplus and returned most of that surplus to savings, and we've made some prudent allocations to meet the public policy objectives that the government made clear in the election.

                                             In fact, the passage of this legislation through the Senate today would mean, in terms of the substantial commitments that the government made during the course of the election, that we have, despite the trenchant opposition of those opposite, worked our way through all of those election commitments. This is a government that does what it says it was going to do. In fact, in relation to the Housing Australia

                                             , this is a commitment that we made in the context of what was not recognised by the previous government as a problem. We have made a significant commitment here and a significant series of commitments more broadly in terms of our housing policy.

                                               As we made clear yesterday, the Greens will be supporting the passage of this bill through the Senate after reaching an agreement with the government on an additional $1 billion in immediate funding for public and community housing, which is on top of the $2 billion that we had already forced from this government. Importantly, instead of the government's gamble on the stock market, we also secured an agreement from the government to guarantee a flow of $500 million in annual disbursements from the Housing Australia

                                               I'm also proud that the Greens have been able to push Labor to build these homes to a high disability standard as part of these negotiations. From day one, we have been crystal clear and completely transparent about what we have been asking for to tackle this housing crisis that millions in our community are struggling and suffering under, and the agreements with the government move us in that direction. There is nothing sinister about these agreements, as the opposition seems to imply—probably because they judge everyone from their standard. I also want to make clear that while many of the non-government amendments before the Senate have merit, because of the agreement with the government, we will only be supporting amendments that give effect to that agreement. Finally, as our second reading amendment makes clear, we will continue our fight for a rent freeze and for rent caps. The community movement for renters' rights has grown immensely over the last nine months, and the Greens will not stop until the federal and state Labor governments are forced to respond to the scale of the rental and housing crisis in this country.

                                                Minister, I'm a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia. In that capacity, I note that this bill is completely unnecessary. It's not needed. Here's why: if the government cut Australia's immigration intake by just 10 per cent of the current one million arrivals, it would save the building of many more houses than Labor claims this fund will build. The housing crisis will lessen. Instead, we are here dealing with dirty deals done dirt cheap. The deals are cheap for the Greens, yet taxpayers will be paying billions. As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I note that the people of Australia are disgusted to look at this parliament and see the rotten horse-trading and deal-making going on.

The goal of the Greens and Labor is to come into this chamber to preach to the world that they're helping Australians—helping you. The Greens' rent caps have already led directly to faster rent increases, because landlords understandably want to get ahead of the rent caps. The Greens are already hurting renters. The housing crisis is a problem that government created entirely.

                                                The government is now claiming to have the solution. That's a fraud, Minister. The Albanese Labor government has allowed one million people to arrive in this country in just one year. That's 460,000 in net migration and 540,000 students visas. Every one of those needs a bed and a roof over their head. That's not to mention the additional 200,000 other visas. That's 1.2 million. A population flood the size of Adelaide has hit this country in 12 months. That's the cause of the housing and rental crisis. It's completely government made. If your rent has gone up, you can't afford a house or you can't even find a place to live, like the people in regional Queensland towns living in caravans, tents, parks and cars and under bridges. Just remember this: the Albanese Labor government brought one million people into this country in one year.

Trying to flood this industry that is already at capacity with huge amounts of taxpayer money is only going to make the funnel spill over. That will mean millions and potentially billions of your taxes wasted. Let's not forget the government's figures. They think they can build a house in Australia for $83,000. What kind of house is that? They must be smoking some powerful stuff over in the ministry for housing. It doesn't matter how many billions this government wants to spend; we will never be able to build enough houses to catch up with the current rate of immigration. That is a clear fact. It's basic arithmetic. It's practical.

                                                right now that the Greens introduced to end sustainable forest logging. Timber is the only resource that's truly renewable, yet the Greens have a bill saying we can't harvest the wood used in house frames while claiming with this bill that they want to build more houses. I guess that is okay. We can just build houses with steel frames, right? Not according to the Greens. Too many ingredients in making steel are coal and iron ore, Australia's two major mining commodities. The Greens want to end mining in Australia, so we would have nothing with which to make the steel. So the Greens say they want to build more houses—virtue signalling—yet if Australia implemented their policies we would have no steel, no wood with which to build houses. And if our coal, iron ore and timber industries survived the Greens blight, prices of house timber and steel will be far higher thanks to the Greens restrictions. The hypocrisy is so damn thick we could cut it with a knife.

                                                The Greens policies are antihuman. One Nation's policy includes many solutions to the government-created housing crisis, taken together holistically because the problem is many factored. Among these immediate solutions to the housing crisis is that we must cut immigration immediately, reduce our arrivals to zero net immigration, meaning only allow the same number of people into the country as the number that leave so departures cancel out arrivals. As Australians know, this country is already bursting at the seams. A cut to immigration would allow our housing stock, our essential services—hospitals, our schools—and other services time to catch up. If we don't stop immigration or cut immigration, life is going to get far, far worse for Australians, and it is already getting bad with the cost of living being the No. 1 problem on people's minds. To continue this unprecedented immigration intake in the face of the housing and cost-of-living crisis is an act of criminal negligence against the Australian people.

How many houses does the government expect the million student and permanent migrant arrivals will need? How many houses does the government expect to build in 12 months? How many houses will the government's allocation of taxpayer funds build?

                                                 There was, in fact, a question at the end there. The government does not support the policy prescription that you've offered on migration. While you can hear echoes of the proposition that you've just put in relation to migration in some of what is best described as circular comments of the Leader of the Opposition on migration and housing, in fact, migration will be an important part and has been an important part of the housing industry in Australia since World War

In fact, if you spend time on any building site in Australia, what you will find are migrants, permanent and temporary—mostly permanent—who in fact make up a very large part of the labour force building homes, building apartment blocks, building shopping centres all over Australia.

I hear your argument with your colleagues down here in the Greens' political party. The government has always made it very clear: where there are constructive suggestions from anyone on the crossbench we will work with people—senators and members—across the parliament in the national interest where there are sensible amendments proposed to reach agreement on legislation in its passage through this parliament.

I'll just assure you, and all of the crossbench senators, that the government's approach has been consistent in terms of this legislation and will be consistent in the future. Where there are opportunities for constructive discussion about government legislation then we will engage in that.

As I said in my previous contributions in this place, it's really disappointing that, once again, we see the Australian taxpayer having to be the one who forks out because of Labor's botched policy development. If only the Labor Party had actually bothered to put together an appropriate product to take to the market to address the issue they were seeking to deliver on, instead of just coming in with this ridiculous $10 billion off-balance-sheet financially engineered thing that we know is very unlikely to deliver the kinds of funds which would enable the disbursement that Senator

                                                  . The legislation hasn't even gone through this place yet! We're also having a guillotine, because, clearly, those opposite don't want us to continue to ask questions about where they're getting the money from, what the modelling is and why they've failed to define terms such as 'social housing', 'affordable housing' and 'acute housing'. These are really fundamental definitions in order for us to understand what this particular legislation is going to do. In the absence of those definitions, we can only imagine the opportunity for the states and territories to use these disbursements and to use this fund as a slush fund. They could do whatever they like with the money that this government is obviously going to channel through to them.

                                                  This is just another classic example of a rushed, headline policy that has not had the detail dealt with and, once again, Australian taxpayers and the people who are impacted by this will be the ones who suffer. We actually don't know whether there will be one house delivered by this. Clearly, the Greens have managed to convince the government to put in a minimum disbursement of $500 million. We have no modelling to understand whether that $500 million is even a realistic amount of money to be delivered as a net gain from this fund over a period of time. And we're not talking about this fund generating $500 million, because of course the interest has to come out of it. We don't know what the modelling is around the interest and we don't know what the government is expecting. But what we do know is that if we base it on what happened last year—if this fund had been in place last year—not only would it not have made any money it would actually have lost money. So the question the government needs to answer for the Australian public is: how long is this $10 billion actually going to last under the current circumstances? We have great volatility in our markets and there are no security provisions in there in order to save for a rainy day. That's because they have agreed with the Greens that the disbursement is a minimum of $500 million. If the fund makes more than that—please, it would be great if it did—they're going to disburse all those funds. So they will disburse the extra funds in the years they make more than the net $500 million—if they do—but there's no provision for what they're going to do in putting money away for the years when they don't make the money.

Why is the government allowing one million students and permanent migrants into the country in just 12 months? How many houses does the government expect a million students and permanent migrant arrivals will need? How many houses does the government expects to build in 12 months?
