        The coalition supports this amendment to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security Act
        </a>
        to assist with the transition to digital television for households eligible for assistance. The measure was announced as part of the recent budget in a package of measures targeted at regional areas in Victoria,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and Queensland. These of course will be the first regions where the analog signal will be switched off under the government switch-over timetable, commencing in Mildura in the first six months of next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4106" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security Legislation Amendment (Digital Television Switch-over) Bill 2009
        </a>
        amends the Social Security Act to allow for eligible households to be identified for the purposes of the proposed assistance measures. These households include those where one or more residents are in receipt of the maximum rate of the age pension, disability support pension, carer payment,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        service pension or income support supplement. The assistance is described as ‘practical, in-home assistance’.
       </p>
       <p>
        Though no detail is provided in the bill, the department confirmed during budget estimates that the assistance would include a high-definition digital set-top box, delivered and installed; any necessary cabling in the home; and some instruction on how to use the set-top box. During questioning at Senate estimates, the department advised that they are currently putting together tender documents for the rollout of the assistance in Mildura, the first place for the switch-off, where they estimate that there are approximately 3½ thousand eligible households. They anticipate one tenderer to source the boxes, contact eligible households and arrange installation of the equipment. We trust that the department will ensure that the successful tenderer or tenderers approach the task with what will need to be the appropriate sensitivities in relation to these social security recipients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Discussion at estimates also—and properly—touched on how any potential to abuse this assistance package is minimised, and we encourage the government to ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to protect the integrity of the package and ensure it successfully reaches its target audience. The coalition supports the government’s commitment to protecting personal information, particularly in relation to the arrangements with contractors delivering this assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition has long been calling for the government to provide certainty for viewers as this switch-over deadline rapidly approaches. For eligible households in Mildura, such as pensioners, this measure will provide some certainty about their capacity to access and utilise the equipment needed to view a digital picture. I note and draw to the Senate’s attention that, if the eligible viewer does not own the establishment, they will not receive assistance in relation to cabling and the antenna. While I understand the motive behind that decision, I think it is something that the government will have to monitor to ensure that eligible social security recipients are not inadvertently denied the opportunity to access a digital signal when the analog is switched off.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is, of course, only one of many aspects required for certainty for all regions as they approach the switch-over. There is still some significant uncertainty in these regional communities, particularly in my state of South Australia but also in Victoria and Queensland, about their ability to receive a digital signal and the steps they need to take to ensure that they are not left behind in relation to the switch-over. While supporting this bill, we continue to encourage the government to provide further detail to regional communities in these states, the first to be affected by the switch-over, about their ability to receive a digital signal.

         I thank all senators for their contribution. I know that Senator Minchin is raising these issues out of genuine concern, to make sure that the government’s program works as effectively as it can, and we welcome that. Thank you to all senators who have contributed to this.
