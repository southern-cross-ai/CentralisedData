        I move:

       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to a question without notice she asked today relating to native title.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians be aware, be very aware of the Albanese Labor government, which is coming to take your land. Do you know why I say this? In my question to the minister representing the Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        commission I asked why funding was given to a Queensland Aboriginal group to make a native title claim against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redland_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Redland City Council
        </a>
        . I asked how much funding was given to the group and how much funding was given to the other side, Redland council—absolutely nothing.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are funding the Queensland native title body to the tune of $71 million over the next five years, yet the funding has been withdrawn from any respondent to defend themselves against this. We're talking about Redland City Council, of 3½ thousand council owned or managed properties. That means the ratepayers are going to have to fund this. How deceitful are you? You are quite happy to see Australians' land being challenged and be taken up under the consideration that there is already 50 per cent of native title land owned in this country by native title and another 10 per cent under determination. A fund was even set up to buy back land as well, and you are funding them to make claims. We heard of another council, in Sydney, that has been attacked. There is 4,000 square metres of land that is worth about $100 million, and you are funding this.
       </p>
       <p>
        This $71 million—I'm warning Australians—is only to do with Queensland. Go and have a look at what funding is for the rest of Australia. Yet they're not giving any money. They pulled the funding for Australians to be able to stand up and fight these claims. This Labor Party government that we have here has no concern about this country or you or your interests or that you were born here and that it is your land as well. She couldn't even answer my question 'when will these native title claims end?' She couldn't even answer the question and she didn't want to.
