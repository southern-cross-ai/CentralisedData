         flag is a powerful and respected symbol for all Australians. The Australian government is aware of the concerns around the copyright of the Aboriginal flag and would like to see a resolution to this issue in a way that respects the rights of the flag's creator while ensuring the flag continues to be a powerful symbol of unity for Aboriginal people. It is a delicate and sensitive issue, and the government respects the copyright of Mr Thomas and the interests of all parties. We do not want to see the process currently underway jeopardised. It's important to note that the Australian Aboriginal flag can be flown freely, as per the intention of copyright holder Mr Thomas.
