        It hasn't been easy for our local wine producers these last few years. They've been trying to grow their businesses, but how can they? There have been COVID lockdowns and low tourism. There have been natural disasters, and Tassie wine producers have been struggling to keep their businesses afloat. They've got bills to pay, just like the rest of us. That's why I've been so supportive of the Australian Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grant program. It's why I was so concerned when the future of this program wasn't clear. I called for the government to give winemakers some certainty over their future, and I'm very happy to see that the government listened. We got confirmation in Tuesday's budget that the program is continuing. This is very welcome news for our Tassie wine producers.

        from Bream Creek Vineyard was so relieved when we called him to tell him the news. He's building a brand-new cellar door near

        . With this grant continuing he can employ the staff he needs to ensure the best possible visitor experience. It's also a relief for businesses around Fred. They're reliant on his new cellar door to help bring tourists to the area. These tourists will spend money at local hotels, cafes, restaurants and shops. It shows how important these grants are to rural and regional communitiesâ€”not just for the flow-on effect of tourist dollars but also for the job opportunities they create.

        I want to thank Minister Watt and the government for continuing this program. I promise you, these businesses are worth investing in. I know they are, as do you. Next time you're in Tassie, Senator Watt, give me a call. I'll make sure that you get to see the best and brightest of the wine cellar door industry here in Tasmania, and I'm sure Fred will look after us.
