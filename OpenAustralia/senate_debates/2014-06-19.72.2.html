        My question is to the Minister for Defence. Following the minister's recent trip to Japan with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Foreign Minister
        </a>
        , the Foreign Minister was quoted in
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        newspaper as saying that discussions with the Japanese government included 'the prospect of purchasing even an entire submarine'. Will the minister rule out the purchase of submarines from Japan for Australia's future submarine fleet, or are you afraid to contradict your protector, Ms Bishop?

          We all know that, in 2009, the then Labor government made a commitment to buy 12 submarines with an initial operating capability due in 2025-26. Of course, that plan was never adhered to and, indeed, Labor did absolutely nothing to further that program. In 2013, because of its own inactivity, Labor was forced to move the initial operating date for capability by four years to 2029-30. In doing so, it removed nearly $20 billion from the program leading up to that date. So submarines, under Labor, were in a state of complete and utter shambles.

          In the recent two-plus-two defence and foreign ministers meeting in Japan—a very, very successful meeting—Australia and Japan discussed proposals to enhance practical bilateral defence cooperation between the two countries, reinforcing messages from the Shangri-La dialogue in Singapore the week before. Security and defence cooperation with Japan is a very important cornerstone of our bilateral relationship, which builds upon the 2007 joint declaration—

             In order to strengthen our defence cooperation with Japan, we are examining a number of areas to enhance that cooperation through exercises bilateral and trilateral and the exchange of defence science and technology. One of those areas is in submarine hydrodynamic technology. But of course we are talking to many other countries about this because—

If the senator had the faintest idea what he was talking about—which he does not—he would understand that it is simply not that simple. In dealing with the matter of submarines—having seen the Labor Party, with huge fanfare, announce a program that had no money and no work done over five years—we are starting, as I said, with a very clean sheet of paper. We are consulting the Germans, the French, the Brits and the
