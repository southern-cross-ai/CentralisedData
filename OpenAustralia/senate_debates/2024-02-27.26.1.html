        Today I want to shine a spotlight on an individual who embodies the spirit of dedication, community service and resilience: Nathan Conroy. Nathan has an incredible backstory. His journey is one of remarkable perseverance and commitment to public service. He's an Irishman who has chosen to make Australia his home. He married a local girl, Steffie, and they have a young son, Callan, and they've settled down in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_South" rel="nofollow">
         Frankston South
        </a>
        , just around the corner from where she grew up. They are typical of many Australian families; they're working hard to pay their mortgage and they've got skyrocketing bills. They do that to ensure there is a bright future for their children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nathan stood for council in 2020 because he wanted to change his community for the better. For three years in a row, Nathan has been selected by his peers to be mayor. They voted for him because they knew he had a plan for his community, and he's been able to deliver on that plan. He's demonstrated himself to be a leader in his community. He's delivered more infrastructure, better services and greater financial accountability for his council.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nathan knows that the cost of living is the No. 1 issue for the people of Dunkley because he's spoken to thousands of residents—thousands of residents—whether it be out doorknocking, or on listening posts, or, in the last week and a half, on the early voting pre-poll. I've been out in Dunkley with him, and there is white-hot anger out there on the ground towards this Labor government for their wrong priorities and their broken promises, whether they be on groceries, electricity and gas or, now, on cars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nathan Conroy, as an alternative, has such a strong track-record of fighting for the people of Frankston, and, if he's elected on Saturday, I know that he will also deliver for the people of Dunkley.
