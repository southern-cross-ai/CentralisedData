        These amendments give effect to the parliamentary joint standing committee on nation building, to which I referred in my speech in the second reading debate. As I indicated, it is essential that there is parliamentary scrutiny over the disbursement of taxpayers’ funds to be spent on infrastructure in excess of $50 million and that the priorities that have been recommended are reflected. These amendments essentially establish a joint house committee that will consist of 12 people—six from each house and with each house having one independent committee representative—that is, five coalition, five Labor, one Independent and one representative from the crossbenches of the Senate. The committee members would scrutinise the three funds that are being set up.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments enable the setting up of the joint house committee and provide for its reference, which pertains to the three funds. The amendments also provide that the advice on which the advisory bodies makes their decisions, those decisions and the advisory bodies’ reports to the minister be laid on the tables of the houses of parliament within three sitting days after that report to the minister has been made so that the parliament has the ability to scrutinise the advice and the basis on which that advice was made. That advice would then clearly inform the deliberations of the joint house committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are extremely sensible amendments that go to transparency, and we have heard a lot from the government about the need for transparency. The amendments go to the heart of accountability and will enable the community to see within a short time the recommendations of the advisory bodies for each of the three funds. Having given the advice to the minister, that advice is then made available to the parliament and to the people so that they can read the basis upon which the advisory committee’s recommendations to the minister have been made. The joint house committee will then be in a position to scrutinise that. Of course, that means that the community, through the joint house committee, will be involved in the process of nation building and of making determinations about nation-building priorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This process will take away the temptation of government to pork barrel with taxpayers’ money for the purpose of influencing election outcomes and providing election sweeteners. There has been way too much of that in this country. The amendments provide for transparency, accountability and proper parliamentary scrutiny. I urge the support of the Senate for these amendments to establish the joint standing committee on nation building.

         On behalf of the coalition, I indicate our pleasure to be moving these amendments jointly with the Greens. We think that this is a very important initiative to ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny of these three new funds. We think that it is in the government’s own interest to support these amendments. Any rejection of these amendments by the government for the very important element of parliamentary scrutiny of these funds will, in the public’s mind and indeed in the minds of members of this chamber, suggest that the government has something to hide.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we were in government we were lectured for 11½ years by the Labor Party about the importance of parliamentary scrutiny, transparency and oversight of activities of this kind. I would be amazed if the government had any credible arguments about a joint committee of this kind between the two houses, with neither the government nor the opposition having a majority of members. It is appropriate that there be a specialist committee of the parliament that pays close and particular attention to the activities of these funds and to which
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         is accountable. It is important to have a committee dedicated to this task rather than only having, as we heard from the government, general parliamentary oversight.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to stress that we are not submitting here any proposal that involves a committee having veto power over expenditure from these funds. That is not what this is about. We are not trying to prevent the government exercising its proper executive authority but we are saying that there should be a mechanism of this kind to ensure proper transparency, accountability and parliamentary oversight of the activities of the government with respect to these funds, which at least initially do involve some substantial sums of money. I would have thought it would be in the government’s interest to be able to avoid any suggestion, which will arise if this is not in place, that there is partisanship involved in expenditure from these funds. Having been in government I am well aware—and certainly the Labor Party accused us of this—that governments can be tempted to use these as ‘slush funds’. If the government wants to avoid that sort of accusation, the best way to do so is to accept these amendments. They do not cramp the government in any way. All these amendments do is ensure that there is parliamentary oversight and parliamentary scrutiny, without any veto being applied. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

          The government will be opposing the jointly sponsored amendments. There might be some validity in the claims made by the opposition and the Greens if, in fact, we had not sought to increase transparency, over and above that which we saw from the former government, in the assessment of these projects. The point I would make is that we have gone well beyond what the former government did in this regard in other areas. The

           Bill
          </a>
          2008 already provides for rigour and transparency in relation to payments from the funds—much greater levels of rigour, I would argue, than we ever saw from the former government with respect to other allocations for particular projects. We have improved transparency and accountability.
         </p>
         <p>
          The spending on specific projects is to be assessed by independent advisory bodies against evaluation criteria, and that is a significant change. The projects will then be considered through the budget process, and the infrastructure projects will be reported in the budget papers. Having improved the rigour and accountability of projects through an independent advisory body, we do not see why it is then necessary to add to the existing accountability processes, which are significant—all of us from the government and the opposition are very well used to the rigours of the estimates process. We fail to see why it is necessary to add yet another duplicative parliamentary process to the existing rigour of the Senate estimates process, given that we have included independent advisory bodies in the bill—which, as said, we did not see from the former government.
         </p>
         <p>
          The annual appropriation acts will include the maximum limit on the amount that can be paid out in a particular financial year. The annual limit on expenditure will provide that parliament has the mechanism to oversee the rate at which amounts are being expended. As we all know from estimates, there are a whole range of projects which are funded through the appropriation bills and which are subject to enormous rigour at estimates. So we do not see why there needs to be the creation of yet another parliamentary committee beyond that which exists at the present time.

           I am disappointed that the government is not supporting these amendments. I think it is disingenuous to say that there is a rigorous assessment of government spending through the estimates process. I remind the parliament about the grants that were made under the last government and the absolute rorting of some of those, particularly those regional grants and also the forest industry grants. I have been pursuing those through estimates. The Auditor-General wrote scathing reports on both sets of grants programs, saying they were appallingly administered.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">
            DAFF
           </a>
           ’s oversight of grants, particularly those forest industry grants, DAFF have of course had to change their assessment procedures and so on. They were in a situation where grants were made without any kind of proper scrutiny at all. Getting the information out of them as to what happened has been like drawing teeth. There has been money spent in Tasmania in terms of the bushfire expenditure that the Commonwealth made after those terrible bushfires that happened. I have been asking for the last six months: how was the money spent? That is not an unreasonable question. Where was the money spent? How was it spent?
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
            The Commonwealth
           </a>
           minister says to me: ‘We’re awaiting a report from Tasmania. Tasmania hasn’t provided that report.’ The people of Tasmania do not know where the money is spent. The federal parliament does not know how the money is spent.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, whilst you might say that there are technically processes for securing this kind of information, they are long and drawn-out processes. It can take a year to get that information after the money is expended, or even longer—if you ever get to the bottom of how the money was spent. But the issue here is not that those processes do not exist; it is that it is important that those advisory boards—they are appointed with expertise and they are going to make recommendations to ministers—make their advice public in a timely manner and that it is scrutinised by the parliament. If that advice is not public, how do we know, when the minister announces his infrastructure project, whether in fact that was what was recommended?
          </p>
          <p>
           I remind this chamber that, just before the last election, the then Minister for the Environment and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
            Water Resources
           </a>
           ,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
            Malcolm Turnbull
           </a>
           , now the Leader of the Opposition, changed a recommendation that came in about a university grant process. He crossed out ‘
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">
            ANU
           </a>
           ’ and put in the university of his choice, in the lead-up to the election—after an assessment process had been gone through and a recommendation had been gone through as to which universities should get this research funding, he just put his pen through it. We could not get that information for a long time—and now we have. The point I am making is that the people of Australia want the recommendations that the advisory boards are making, and any documents pertaining to that, to be available for people to scrutinise and for the parliament to scrutinise. So, whilst I totally accept the processes that the parliament has, they are neither timely nor particularly efficient in providing all the information you need. Whilst the grants I have spoken about were important, in terms of their dollar value they were small, compared with what we are talking about. That is why I have said that, where the expenditure is $50 million or more—we are not talking about every grant that is made; we are talking about grants where a significant sum is being spent—it is appropriate that the parliament scrutinise the grant.

            I will not be repetitive because of the time constraints but, on the logic that is being advanced, where we have significant expenditure in any government department on a major program, under these amendments we would set up yet another committee to oversight a program. We have got committees to do that and the process works very well—that is, the estimates process. We do not support the amendments. I recognise the numbers and we will not be calling a division.

I note the arguments of the government in relation to this matter and what the government said occurred when they were in opposition. I also note the criticisms of the Commonwealth Auditor-General in relation to the Regional Partnerships grants. I think it is important that we learn from what has occurred in the past and these amendments give an added degree of accountability and transparency. I therefore welcome and support these amendments.

              I want to take this opportunity to reject completely the accusations by our co-sponsor on these amendments of any rorting of programs under the coalition government. I want to place on record our complete rejection of those suggestions. Nevertheless, I do think Senator Milne is absolutely right about the virtues of increasing parliamentary scrutiny of these three funds.
             </p>
             <p>
              These are three brand new capital funds, the like of which the Commonwealth government has never had before, that I think would benefit considerably from a committee of both houses specialising in the scrutiny of their activities and taking a proactive role in examining the virtues of prospective decisions. We have the estimates committee process but that is all after the event, and in the short time they have available to them estimates committees often get diverted by a whole lot of other issues that deny them the opportunity to properly scrutinise the sort of activities which these funds are undergoing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course at some point down the track, if Senator Sherry was right and it was the case that other parliamentary oversight was sufficient to mean that this committee was no longer serving a proper purpose, that could be considered by the parliament. But we think that, given the uniqueness of these funds and the moneys available to them, specialist parliamentary scrutiny is entirely appropriate.

              While these are lengthy amendments they all go to the one purpose and that is to improve transparency. I would have thought the Labor Party, given its track record and rhetoric in relation to transparency of executive decisions, should not have any objection to this series of amendments. All the amendments do is to seek to improve that transparency. All that is required is that when a minister chooses a project he or she table in the parliament a statement of reasons why that project was supported. The requirement would not go to all the supporting material but it would allow the public and the parliament to compare the project supported by the relevant minister to both the report of the joint standing committee, which the Senate has agreed should be established, and to the projects recommended by advisory boards.
             </p>
             <p>
              We think this is an important element in the establishment of these funds. This is not a great burden on the government but, of course, governments find these things a nuisance. By virtue of these amendments the parliament would be asking the government to ensure that, when the government chooses a project to be funded from one of these funds, they lay on the table in the parliament a statement of reasons why the project was supported. I commend the series of amendments to the Senate.

               As I have previously pointed out, the bill already provides for rigor and transparency. Spending on specific projects would be assessed by independent advisory bodies and I would point out that the Senate has added yet another body, a joint parliamentary committee, on top of the additional rigor of independent advisory bodies. Here we have a set of amendments that go to further requirements over and above that which this government has set out, which are a considerable improvement on the practices of the previous government. These amendments go over and above the joint committee that has just been supported by amendment. All the agreed infrastructure projects will be reported in the budget papers.
              </p>
              <p>
               I point out, as I did earlier, that as all of these projects are reported we have the capacity, which no doubt will be used, for each minister that is referred to in these amendments to be questioned—as I am sure they will be, very rigorously and vigorously—as is the Senate’s rights at estimates. We already have a process, so why do we need to add another? I note that there are other amendments that go to even more processes over and above what has already been agreed to by the government in the bill and over and above what has already been included via passage of the amendment that has just been added by the Senate. We do not support the amendments moved by the opposition.

                  We think this is a very important series of amendments to this bill which will improve it. The amendments ensure that any project recommended by a relevant minister must have taken into account the running costs of the project and prohibits any upfront fees being charged on a project, as we have seen occur in

                  where the government has required project proponents to pay upfront fees to the government. The wording is set out most clearly, for example, in subclause 25:

                  As Senator Sherry would now know, being in government—as I certainly experienced in government—one of the real traps in providing capital funding to particular projects is the issue of ongoing running costs of the project. We think there is a real risk to the budget in future and to the recurrent expenditures in the budget in future, if there is no account taken of ongoing running costs, and who is going to pay for them, in the assessment of projects. We had a dramatic example of this problem with the Labor Party’s glib promise at the last election to provide computers to everybody in schools. It is a promise that has not been honoured in full and there has now been a massive blow-out in the total cost of that promise because they did not properly allow for the associated running costs of such a capital expenditure, with the government having to find another $800 million to ensure that these computers can actually be used. That is a classic case of not taking full account. I saw, in sitting around the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSC" rel="nofollow">
                   NSC
                  </a>
                  with Defence projects, that taking into account ongoing running costs is critical.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We think this is a very important series of amendments and we see no reason why the government would not want to support them. In relation to the prohibition of upfront fees, that has been raised with the coalition by a lot of firms in the development and examination of this legislation. As I understand it, without this prohibition there is a risk of superannuation funds being involved in these projects because they cannot make such payments. That is the advice as I understand it. In any event, we think the practice of these upfront fees being paid to governments is wrong and should be prohibited. I commend this set of amendments to the Senate.

                  <p>
                   These amendments cover two broad thematic areas. With respect to the requirement that all project funding decisions need to ensure there are financial commitments from all asset owners and stakeholders to meet the whole-of-life asset costs, I would point out that under the evaluation criteria framework for the funds, a core principle is that proponents must demonstrate they can achieve established standards in implementation and management. They cannot get beyond first base unless they disclose that. This framework includes that a recipient can support infrastructure once it is built. I think it would be very obvious that, in that criteria framework, you would take into account that the recipient can support the infrastructure once it is built. There would obviously have to be some ongoing arrangement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The interim evaluation criteria for the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund require a demonstration of how the infrastructure proposal can continue to operate beyond receiving payments from the funds. It would seem to me to be fundamental common sense that you include that in the evaluation criteria, and we do that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   With respect to the prohibition of the payment of upfront fees on projects in situations where the federal government puts its money in but the state or the private sector do not, funding arrangements will be covered in funding agreements which will protect the Commonwealth’s interests. Prohibiting upfront fees could lead to less coinvestment from certain sectors, such as with the higher education institutions. The evaluation framework requires proponents to demonstrate that they can achieve established standards in implementation and management.

                   I do not know where Senator Minchin got his information about superannuation funds from. I do spend a fair bit of time with them in discussions around all manner of issues, but this issue around upfront fees and/or financial commitments over whole-of-life asset costs has not been raised with me by superannuation funds. I cannot recall one fund raising it with me. They have raised other matters about infrastructure investment generally, and a whole range of fronts where they experience some alleged frustration, I would have to say—sometimes a legitimate frustration and sometimes other issues I am not quite so sure about. But I have not had them raise any specific concerns about the government’s proposals in evaluation criteria. Indeed, superannuation funds that I have talked to overwhelmingly support the initiatives of the government and are not looking to this sort of amendment. Anyway, I suspect that Senator Milne is going to get up and support it, I recognise the numbers and I will not be calling a division.

                    I thank Senator Sherry for his remarks, but I am disappointed he does not see the purpose of making the amendments. In relation to the first part of the clause in relation to the ongoing running costs, Senator Sherry is the star witness for the prosecution. If he says it is obvious that all this would be taken into account, then he cannot have any grounds for objecting to this being a requirement placed upon the minister in relation to any payments. I would have thought that would be of no concern to the government if the government is confident that this will be a function of the way in which the payments will work. I thank him for his support.

                      Again, this set of amendments goes to appropriate accountability and parliamentary scrutiny and oversight. As is the case with many other functions of government, it ensures that determinations are disallowable, and those are the determinations that place funds into these three new infrastructure funds. We think it is appropriate that the minister should do so by virtue of a disallowable instrument. That will ensure that there is scrutiny on the money going into these funds and ensure that the source of moneys placed into the funds is open and transparent and able to be scrutinised by the parliament.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      We do not think this is onerous in any way. You would anticipate that, in the normal course of events, no disallowance would ever be moved. But we do think that it is appropriate that there is the parliamentary opportunity to scrutinise the funding sources of the funds in an open and transparent fashion. So I commend this set of amendments to the Senate.

                       Again, the government will not be supporting this new requirement. The arrangement for credits to the funds is consistent with the approach taken for the

                       </a>
                       and the Higher Education Endowment Fund. Credits to the fund are determined through legislative instruments which are required to be tabled in the parliament and are also registered on the

                       of Legislative Instruments. Normally such determinations would be regarded as administrative rather than legislative in character; however, to provide transparency to the parliament, these determinations have been made non-disallowable instruments. We will not be supporting the amendments.

                        <p>
                         This is quite an important issue. It goes to the matters that should be taken into account in giving advice on projects. The important issue here is that of competitive neutrality. It is always an issue when governments fund projects—and I saw this often through the 11½ years that we were in government, and I am sure Senator Sherry is well aware of this. It is quite an important principle that government funding of particular projects does not breach the very important principle of competitive neutrality and, either by design or inadvertence, disadvantage private providers of similar or equivalent services by virtue of taxpayers’ money being used to fund particular projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         It is an inherent principle of government—one not always necessarily properly observed by either side of the parliament at state or federal level, but one the coalition does believe is very important. It is one that I personally believe is critically important and, in my years as finance minister, it is one that I took great account of. So I do think it is quite important that, in relation to projects that are to be funded, there is this assessment of the question of competitive neutrality. It is quite important that the rights of private providers of services derived from infrastructure are taken proper account of and they are not commercially disadvantaged by the consequences of taxpayers’ money being used to fund particular projects. So I do commend these amendments.

                           I must say that I am surprised the Greens are supporting this—for a pretty obvious reason. It is not always easy to tell what is in fact competitive neutral policy. Competitive neutral policy requires that the Commonwealth does not use its legislative or fiscal powers to advantage its own businesses over the private sector. As I say, it is not always easy to tell, as we have seen with
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Learning" rel="nofollow">
                            ABC Learning
                           </a>
                           , for example—which is why I would have thought the Greens would have been a little more hesitant to jump in to support these amendments.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The government does adhere to the neutrality policy. Consistent with best practice, applications for payments from the funds will be managed on a competitive basis. Existing government policy will apply to the funds where relevant, including competitive neutrality guidelines. Therefore, we do not believe there is any need to legislate this requirement.

                            I will speak to opposition amendments (62) to (69) together because they all relate to the Communications Fund. I referred to this very important matter in my speech in the second reading debate. One of the most significant initiatives of the coalition government was to set aside in perpetuity an amount of $2 billion in the Communications Fund, as I recall, to be managed, separately and independently, by the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
                             Future Fund

                            board and to be preserved and set apart and unable to be tampered with for any partisan reason by any government of the day. It was set aside in perpetuity to provide in perpetuity the earnings from the fund—which, if you estimated at five per cent a year, would give you $100 million a year—to meet the telecommunications needs of rural and regional Australians.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Rural and regional Australians are the most underserved when it comes to telecommunications, as we all know, by virtue of the evident geography of this country. We set up—and I am pleased to see the government has continued—the regular Glasson reviews of the state of telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. The whole design was to ensure that, based on the findings of the regular Glasson reviews of telecommunication needs in this country, there was then available to meet the identified needs coming out of the regular reviews $100 million a year—every year in perpetuity—to assist rural and regional Australians approach metro equivalent telecommunications services. And that was going to be there forever, as I said.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The government are purporting to say, ‘We’re going to rip that $2 billion out of the Communications Fund and dump it into our Building Australia Fund. We’ll then run it down and it will be gone forever. But don’t worry about that because we’re going to provide in the budget $100 million a year. Trust us; it’ll be there.’ Well, frankly, rural and regional Australians do not trust the government when it comes to the ongoing provision of that $100 million a year. It may have appeared in this budget to get them through this electoral cycle, but, given that we are rapidly seeing the advent of deficits, you can bet your bottom dollar that the first thing to be cut out of the budget by a Labor ministry will be the $100 million per annum for rural telecommunications needs. It would be highly vulnerable to an expenditure review committee looking for easy money in a situation, like the one we are rapidly approaching, of deficit budgets. In stark contrast, the coalition’s provision was of an in perpetuity fund providing, separately and independently, $100 million to ensure that rural and regional telecommunications would be preserved in perpetuity.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            What we have here is a proposal by the Labor Party to breach the walls surrounding this Communications Fund and to grab the money. It will all be gone—the $2 billion—in a flash, and then rural and regional Australians will be left to rely on the charity, at their whim and pleasure, of the Labor government. As I said, having sat around the expenditure review committee myself for many years, you can bet that the first thing that will be targeted will be that $100 million for rural and regional telecommunications. We know that the Labor government has slim regard for the needs of rural and regional telecommunications users, having cancelled the OPEL contract in relation to broadband for rural and regional Australians. So rural and regional Australians need the protection provided by the ongoing status of this Communications Fund.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            These amendments seek to prevent this Labor government from getting its hands on the Communications Fund and from dissipating it within a few years. Therefore we urge the Senate to support these amendments to preserve the Communications Fund. This is the opportunity for the Senate to say to all those living outside metropolitan Australia that we do care for your vital telecommunications needs; we do understand how important this is to you. In my speech on the second reading debate I cited the fears of the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                            Farmers Association were the Communications Fund to be abolished. So I plead with the Senate to support all those that we represent outside the major cities of Australia who need this fund—to preserve it and protect it by supporting these amendments.

                             will not be supporting amendments (62) to (68), (65) and (69)—that double lot of amendments. I certainly agree that it is absolutely critical that we get broadband to rural and regional Australia. We are totally committed to that happening and in my view Senator Conroy should have made clear that the government was going to roll out broadband from the outside in, if you like—to go to those areas which are underserviced and make sure that the rollout starts in rural and regional Australia rather than in the more profitable large city centres. The way to ensure that happening would be to make sure that the tender guarantees access to broadband for rural and regional Australia. So there is certainly an absolute commitment to that.

                             Australia Fund is that there is a high level of compatibility between rolling out energy infrastructure, intelligent networks, smart grids and so on and rolling out information technology. In the same way, when Basslink was built, linking it to Tasmania, we worked to make sure that we were able to attach to that the information technology capacity and so on. Increasingly, as information technology works with new energy technologies and, as I said, intelligent networks, we are going to see a recognition that you have to plan both together and maximise the synergies that those opportunities provide.

                            <p>
                             So I do not think you can continue to see communications as being separate from other forms of infrastructure when there is a high level of compatibility and you can maximise effectiveness and maximise efficiency. But I would like to hear from the government, once again, their commitment to getting broadband to rural and regional Australia. We do not want to see the blowing of a big hole in the fund for rolling out broadband—as I think the coalition’s amendments would do. That is one of the other reasons we do not support what the coalition is proposing. But we certainly do support rolling out broadband in rural and regional Australia as a priority. So I would like to hear from the government exactly how they intend to reassure everyone that that is still going to be the case.

                              I can reaffirm that we have a commitment. It would best come from the minister, Senator Conroy, because that is a debate about which there has been constant questioning in the Senate. Frankly, it is not my responsibility to give those assurances; it is up to Senator Conroy on behalf of the government. But I can give those assurances. That is the purpose for the transfer of the funds. I am sure there will be a very lengthy debate about whatever is the outcome of the process that Senate Conroy is overseeing. I am sure there will be an extensive debate about that but I really do see that as a detailed debate to have on another day.

                              The blunt point I make is that we do not even get to that point, whenever that debate takes place, without the funds. I hope Senator Xenophon, in particular, takes note of what is taking place here. This is an attempt by the opposition to gut the funding so we do not even get to first base. This is an attempt by the former government, the Liberal opposition, a judgement having been cast by the Australian public at the last election—the coalition spent years and years struggling with this very issue and its failure was recognised by the Australian people—to override an election promise of the

I know many others in this country—perhaps for different reasons, not just the nature of the terrain—have experienced significant frustration.

The bill and the associated transitional provisions abolish the Communications Fund and transfer the balance of the fund into the Building Australia Fund. Other funding can be transferred by relevant ministers. The Building Australia Fund will be used to provide the government’s contribution of up to $4.7 billion to the national broadband network.

We have only just got to first base on implementing the election promise and they want to knock one of the legs from the stool that enables us to progress this very, very important issue. It is simply outrageous and it is just another example of the generally negative approach to a range of issues we have seen from the Liberal opposition since their ‘transition’ from government to opposition.

                                will not be supporting these amendments, for the reasons that the minister has just outlined. But there is a question that I think we need to put to you, Minister. Senator Minchin is correct in that the Communications Fund was earmarked for telecommunications services to rural and regional areas, and no such commitment has been made under Minister Conroy’s request for proposals that is afoot at the moment. For example, Telstra, one of the bidders to the process, have made no commitment to rolling the network in from the fringes, where services are extremely patchy, because they were not required to make any such commitment under the

                                . We do not know which way the other bidders are going. I think it is quite important and I would like to see that addressed. What guarantees can you give that the RFP will not simply lead to $4.7 billion being spent on broadband services in profitable inner city areas while rural and regional areas will continue to be disadvantaged—because there is nothing in the RFP that says that that cannot happen?

                                 As I have already indicated—perhaps not precisely enough, given I had a range of other commentary around—we are well aware of your concerns, but there will be a time for debate for you to determine whether those concerns are met when Senator Conroy has completed his process. I am not going to pre-empt the outcome of that process at the moment. The tender process has only just commenced. Whatever legislative requirements flow from the process that Senator Conroy has oversighted, there will be a judgement made. You may or may not be satisfied. I would contend you will be satisfied, without pre-empting that process’s outcome. But you will have a capacity to address whatever deficiencies you identify—hopefully you do not identify any—after Senator Conroy’s process is completed, when we consider effectively the outcome of the process he has been through in that legislation. I think that is the time for you to make your call. It is very difficult if we are expected not even to get to first base because the funding is not provided. That is what this bill goes to. I understand your concerns, but my hope is that you will make a judgement when Senator Conroy gets to the legislative requirements around his process, when it is completed.

                                  The coalition have had some salacious accusations from Senator Sherry on this matter. What is outrageous is what the Labor Party is doing here. This $2 billion only exists because the federal coalition government proceeded with the sale of the remaining 50 per cent of the shares of Telstra, something that the Labor Party bitterly opposed and fought all the way. But we had a clear mandate to sell those remaining shares. The shares were sold, and our undertaking with the Australian people and with this parliament was that $2 billion from the proceeds would go into the Communications Fund. That was our act of faith with people in rural and regional Australia who we understand had concerns about the sale of Telstra. But we said, ‘We’re going to take part of the proceeds of that sale and preserve them in perpetuity for the purposes of providing rural and regional Australians with ongoing funding in perpetuity to support them in their rural and regional telecommunications needs.’
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  So here is Senator Sherry on behalf of the government saying, ‘Isn’t it dreadful that the coalition wants to preserve this $2 billion?’ The $2 billion would not be there if Labor had had their way. If they had succeeded in preventing us selling our remaining shares in Telstra then this $2 billion would not exist. So for them to accuse us of hypocrisy on this and to be outraged is ridiculous. The money is there for rural and regional Australians because of a policy we pursued that the Labor Party opposed at every step. Our act of faith with the people of rural and regional Australia was that that money would be preserved to support their communications needs. I urge the Senate to support us in this endeavour of preserving this funding.

                                  Senator Ludlam, I think quite properly, raised the fact that Labor propose to grab this $2 billion and use it as part-payment towards Labor’s ill-fated and deeply-flawed national broadband network. This again shows the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. As I have said, the $2 billion comes from the proceeds of the sale. The other $2.7 billion also comes from the proceeds of the sale. What Labor have done is grabbed the second instalment of the payment for Telstra shares—and they have the capacity to do this. That was meant to go to the

                                  in fact. So they have deprived the Future Fund of the $2.7 billion to go towards paying the superannuation for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and public servants, and whacked it into Senator Conroy’s national broadband network.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  As Senator Ludlam has properly said, Telstra has made it abundantly clear that all the $4.7 billion is going to do is subsidise the provision of broadband in metropolitan Australia. Rural and regional Australians are not going to see the benefit of this $4.7 billion so they are double losers—they lose the $2 billion from the Communications Fund and then they see it go into metropolitan Australia to provide fibre in metropolitan areas. With the cancellation of the OPEL contract by this government, rural and regional Australians are going to be left hanging out to dry. This is a moment for the Senate to really stand up for rural and regional Australians. Do you care about them or don’t you? What are your priorities? If your priorities are to ensure that rural and regional Australians are protected from the ravages of this Labor government wanting to take away that $2 billion then you will support these amendments.

                                   I would like to add to what Senator Minchin has said. The minister used the word ‘outrageous’. I am going to use the word ‘outrageous’ too. The minister knows full well that that $2 billion was set aside for the future proofing of rural and regional communications. That is what it was put away for in the bank, to earn interest—to keep those services up in rural and regional areas. I find it appalling that the government now want to withdraw that money. They knew what it was put aside for. They knew the previous government put it there. I know full well that people like

                                   argued very hard, when it came to the debate on the full sale of Telstra, that this money should be put aside for the future of those country communities, and I think it is deplorable that you consider withdrawing it.

                                          Governments are not formed in the Senate. We gave a specific election promise. We have not done this after the election; we put it up there in lights. I remember the announcements made. I remember the discussion, as a member of the shadow ministry in opposition, about this and I remember the announcements about this. It was put up in lights well before the election. It is a fact of life that you lost the election. Learn to live with it. This is an election promise—an election commitment. I want to borrow a phrase from Senator Conroy yesterday—

                                              Well, we do not know, Senator Minchin, because it has not been concluded. You can assert a process is flawed but, as Senator Conroy has pointed out, well and very effectively, I might say—other than putting the cart before the horse—what you are trying to do is to bring a halt to a process that you claim is flawed by refusing to allocate the moneys, in large part. We gave an election commitment, a specific promise, which we went to the election on. We won the election—you lost the election.

                                                  You cannot call it a rip-off. Here you are alleging a rip-off. We sat down in a considered way and developed a policy which we believe will ensure the development of a national broadband network that will well service the needs of rural and regional Australians as well as everyone else who lives in Australia, as I said. It was a well-announced policy. As I recall it was very well received. The people of Australia voted on it, and they voted in favour of us.

                                                   I have some questions to ask of both the mover of these amendments and of Senator Sherry on behalf of the government. As I understand it, the $2 billion Communications Fund was set up by the coalition. I think it was supported by the Labor Party. And that fund arose out of the proceeds of the sale of Telstra—something I would have opposed if I had been in this place. But that is another debate that has been and gone. We would not have had this problem if it had not been sold. Be that as it may—

So, as I see it, there is no guarantee that that will occur. That is my principal reservation.

                                                       If there were an alternative approach that would see these moneys transferred into the Building Australia Fund but quarantined by legislation on the basis of how they were supposed to be used and subsumed in the processes that are in this legislation—improved on, I believe, by the amendments of the opposition and the Greens—then I would be more disposed towards that. I do not know what Senator Minchin’s views are in relation to that, but I think the important thing is to guarantee that the money that has been earmarked for telecommunications in regional and rural Australia is there for the purpose for which it was intended—and which, I note, the Labor Party supported, albeit in the circumstances of a privatisation that they opposed.

                                                        In relation to Senator Xenophon’s points, there are no guarantees. The only guarantee is preserving the Communications Fund under the legislation which was passed by this parliament—and which was not opposed by the Labor Party—to establish this Communications Fund in perpetuity in order to protect it from the passing whims of governments of the day and ensure that all of the earnings, which at five per cent would be $100 million a year, go to rural and regional telecommunications. The government has sought to provide some assurances about that, as I mentioned before, by providing in this year’s budget for $100 million a year over the forward estimates. But that lasts as long as each year’s budget. All of the moneys in the forward estimates can be taken away in next year’s budget. I am sure

                                                        and Mr Swan are right now looking for as many savings as they can possibly find to try to prevent the budget from going into deficit.

All we have is a glib promise from the Labor Party to use $4.7 billion to roll out a national broadband network. Those of us who have been on the Senate Select Committee on the

There is no commitment from the Labor Party on that score. All they can do is make glib assurances.

They have cancelled the OPEL contract, which was specifically to subsidise rural and regional Australians to acquire high-speed broadband. No such guarantees exist at all in relation to the $4.7 billion. The government quite glibly says that there will be no cost-benefit analysis of the expenditure of this $4.7 billion, unlike other expenditure from the

That was the purpose of our election commitment. To deliver, to meet the needs of rural and regional Australia through the NBN, we need the funding. It will cost up to $4.7 billion. We came to the conclusion before the election that transferring the $2 billion in the Communications Fund was the most effective way to deliver.

The process has just begun, effectively. We cannot make a judgement about that. What Senator Minchin is effectively doing is bagging the outcome before the outcome is known. I accept the political critique of the opposition and Senator Minchin, although it is a somewhat negative approach. They have reached the conclusion that it is a failure when the process has barely begun. I would suggest that that is not an appropriate way to make a judgement. As I said, there will be a debate about whether the national broadband network delivers to rural and regional Australia on another occasion, when Senator Conroy brings his legislation to this parliament. That debate will occur, but that process is not complete. What we do know is that, if the opposition’s amendments are adopted, that is the end of the funding. What hope is there for the current process that Senator Conroy is going through if the $2 billion cannot be transferred? I would suggest the implications of these amendments being carried would be very, very significant indeed.

It was not delivering the outcome. We established through our policy that an alternative approach was needed. We carefully researched our policy and we presented it before the people. At the end of the day, the Australian people liked our policy—the Labor Party’s policy—in this regard more than they did the Liberal and

It was an election commitment given very specifically.

                                                          Let’s cut to the chase. We have a situation here where $2 billion was set aside with respect to the communications fund. I think it would be fair to say that that money was supported in a bipartisan fashion. That money was earmarked, quarantined for regional and rural Australian telecommunications—which obviously would principally include broadband services and the like. My concern—and I believe it is a legitimate one—is that, if you transfer it into the
                                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building" rel="nofollow">

                                                          Australia Fund, there is no guarantee that the entire quantum of the money that was earmarked before will necessarily be earmarked for the purpose for which the communications fund was set out. That is my concern. I flagged that, if there were a way that that could be quarantined within the Building Australia Fund through a legislative guarantee, I would be quite comfortable with that. I invite the government, if they wish to report progress, to look at this as an alternative amendment. In the absence of that, I am inclined to support the opposition’s amendment.

                                                                 This amends the principles relating to the funds. In particular, it requires that the principles be amended so that the principles now have inserted in them that projects must address ‘climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity conservation’ and ‘prepare for the global oil production peak and subsequent decline in oil production’. These two insertions are critical if we are to make sure that these funds actually do not act as a counterpoint to our climate change mitigation efforts. What I am trying to do here is make sure we have a whole-of-government approach that is internally consistent. The government says its aim is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I have not heard it say so, but it should be saying that we ought to also be addressing energy security to make sure we reduce our dependence on foreign oil as that was certainly a recommendation of the Senate committee of inquiry into Australia’s future oil supplies and alternatives.
                                                                </p>
                                                                <p>
                                                                 What I am saying is that if the whole-of-government approach is to ensure we reduce greenhouse gas emissions and we reduce our dependence on foreign oil then the best way of doing that is to make sure that, in considering what infrastructure to support, we prioritise infrastructure which gives us a win-win situation as to the climate and the economy, which helps us make the transition to a low-carbon economy, and which helps us restructure our cities and redesign our cities accordingly. I cannot believe, in this day and age, with the climate crisis as it is, that anybody would not want to see infrastructure be under, as one of the principles of the fund, consideration as to climate change, greenhouse gas abatement and peak oil. I look forward to the support of both the government and the opposition for this amendment.

There are one or two elements of the six requirements that we might otherwise have been able to support, but we do believe it would be very difficult to apply appropriately several of these criteria. We also believe that all of these projects, being major infrastructure projects, will be subject to the normal laws of the land and of course there are, at a state level and at federal level, significant requirements in relation to infrastructure projects that go to environmental impact statements. So we believe the environmental scrutiny that will be applied to all these projects, by dint of existing state and federal laws, will be sufficient to meet the concerns of the Greens in this matter. While I have enjoyed supporting the Greens—and have enjoyed their support—on several of the amendments to these bills, on balance I am afraid the opposition is not in a position to support this particular amendment.
