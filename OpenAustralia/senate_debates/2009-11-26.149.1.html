        —finally, an opportunity to ask my question. My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib. Can the minister please update the Senate on how the education infrastructure program is supporting jobs in the building sector? Is the minister aware of a recently released

           I thank Senator Pratt for that question. I am happy to inform the Senate that construction through the education stimulus is going extremely well. I have talked about the number of tradespeople—electricians, plumbers, bricklayers et cetera—who are all being supported by the stimulus, but we now have the latest construction figures from September coming out of the ABS, which show a 2.2 per cent increase in total construction and 6.9 per cent annually to September, seasonally adjusted. We have also had further research from a company called Macromonitor, which predicts growth of 11 per cent in building starts across the entire non-residential building sector in 2009-10, after a 30 per cent drop last year.

                Macromonitor Director Nigel Hatcher puts it like this:

               <p class="italic">
                This rebound has been almost entirely due to the boost to education building coming from the Commonwealth stimulus package.
               </p>
               <p>
                He goes on to say:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                This is the first time that a program of government building work has been of adequate magnitude to offset a major downturn in commercial building in Australia.
               </p>
               <p>
                Peter Verwer from the Construction Forecast Council is in total agreement, saying that ‘the market is basically being held up by government spending and it is mainly education’. He says—and I think opposition senators will find this interesting:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                If you look at the last quarter ABS data of approvals, for the $12 billion of non-residential developments, $7.6 billion of the total approved was education. That’s amazing … it’s historically unprecedented. Without looking at any single number, that has not happened even when Curtin and Menzies were the prime ministers.

In particular, what is the government doing to address the incredible 20 per cent drop in apprenticeship commencements over the last year? I would like to know how—

                    In particular, what is the government doing to address the 20 per cent drop in apprenticeship commencements over the last year? How will Apprentice Kickstart help support young people seeking to enter traditional trades? Also, has the minister has any feedback from business about how they intend to use this initiative?

                     One of the worst aspects of the global recession has been the effect on training. I have said before in this chamber that apprenticeship commencements over the past 12 months have dropped by 21 per cent. The government has been doing everything possible to turn this around. That is why the government put in place in the stimulus package a 10 per cent target of contract labour hours for apprentices. This means that apprentices are keeping their positions on stimulus projects. That 21 per cent would be much, much worse if it were not for the stimulus package.

                     , we have been able to reconfigure the Jobs Fund to improve incentives for apprentices. We have been able to almost treble the commencement bonuses for apprentices—up to almost $5,000—for the summer period. That means that we are going to see more carpentry apprentices, more plumbing apprentices, more electrical apprentices, more fitters and turners et cetera. This is how we will get through the—

Given the minister’s response to my first question—that the education infrastructure program is supporting jobs in the building sector across Australia—I would like to ask the minister to provide examples of projects that are having an impact in communities around Australia.
