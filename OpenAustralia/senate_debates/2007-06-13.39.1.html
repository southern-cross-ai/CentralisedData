        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Johnston. What is the federal government doing to develop its international law enforcement operations both here in Australia and abroad? I further ask: what initiatives are being developed to combat transnational crime?

         I thank the learned senator for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in matters of law and jurisprudence. The story is a very successful one. As most senators would be aware, particularly on this side of the chamber, recently Australian fugitive Mr Tony Mokbel was arrested in Greece as a result of a quite exceptional level of cooperation between law enforcement agencies here in Australia and overseas. I congratulate the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Police
         </a>
         for their outstanding work in intelligence gathering to locate Mr Mokbel. I also want to pay tribute to the Greek police for their outstanding cooperation and the tangible operational success that this arrest and apprehension has brought.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Federal Police have been working for a number of years with Greek authorities, particularly in respect of an advisory role around the 2004
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Olympic Games
         </a>
         in Greece. The relationship has matured very successfully, culminating in this recent apprehension. Recently I discussed with Commissioner Keelty—who at the time happened to be in Cyprus—an opportunity for him to visit Greece and congratulate the Chief of the Hellenic Police Force, Police Lieutenant-General Anastassios Dimoshakis, for their assistance in the reapprehension of Mr Mokbel.
        </p>
        <p>
         As senators would be aware, Mr Mokbel is wanted in Australia to face prosecution for various Commonwealth and Victorian charges. He is also wanted regarding a jail sentence imposed upon him for his conviction for being knowingly concerned with the importation of a trafficable quantity of cocaine—three kilograms—into Australia. I can report that Australia has an extradition treaty with Greece. The Australian Attorney-General’s Department is working very expeditiously with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         and the Victorian police force to prepare the necessary papers for my consideration before forwarding a request to Greek authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
         I further inform the chamber that the story of the AFP’s international deployment to deal with transnational crime is a very successful one. A key strategy in the AFP’s fight against crime across borders is its international network comprising 80 officers in 33 cities in 27 countries around the world. Two additional offices will be opened in New Delhi and Vientiane. The role of the network is to work with international law enforcement agencies to promote information and intelligence exchange that will help combat transnational crime, with the overall objective of protecting Australia. The shifting focus of transnational crime has created new demands upon the Australian Federal Police overseas law enforcement activities. We have recently opened a new post in Bangladesh and, as I have indicated, two posts, in Vientiane and New Delhi, are anticipated.
        </p>

         An example of further positive relationships between Australian law enforcement agencies—the Australian Federal Police and international partners—was on show last Thursday, 7 June, when I presented a cheque for $3,372,000 to Minister Zhang Xin Feng, vice-minister for public security in the People’s Republic of China, in respect of money seized through proceeds of crime legislation. The sum of $55 million was taken by a person in China, and he was arrested in Australia.
