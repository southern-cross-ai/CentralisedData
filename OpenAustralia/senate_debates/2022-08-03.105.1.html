        My question is to the Minister for Women, also representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Minister Gallagher. Polling released today by Fair Agenda confirms that there's strong public support for improving abortion access, with 72 per cent of Australians agreeing that governments should make abortions more readily accessible. Fair Agenda,

        and Children by Choice have all proposed solutions, including expanding Medicare coverage, nurse-led abortion care and better access to long-acting reversible contraceptives. Will the health minister support including medical and surgical abortions as an

         I thank Senator Waters for her question on this very important subject. In terms of the work that is underway at the moment—and this is work that the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Minister Kearney, will be doing alongside the Minister for Health and Aged Care—it is looking at, essentially, access to health services for women and putting together a plan around that. I have had some discussions with her already about this.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also had discussions at the first meeting of women's and women's safety ministers a fortnight ago, where there was some discussion about looking at whether legislation that regulates access to termination of pregnancy services around states and territories could be aligned better—harmonised. That's work that we'll leave to the states and territories, as that's the appropriate place. But I did say that access to health services is really important to the Albanese government—making sure that we are looking at those areas, particularly for women living in rural and remote communities, who have less access to termination of pregnancy services or, in some cases, no access. Those issues will be discussed and examined through the work that the assistant minister for health will be doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         So I'm not in a position to answer your question directly, but the answer I give you is that there is work underway, consultations that will happen at the appropriate level, and then we'll go through a further process around that.

           The polling also showed that 69 per cent of Australians agree that the government should address barriers to access in rural and regional areas. As few as one per cent of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
            GP

           s in rural and regional areas are currently registered to prescribe medical abortions. What is the government doing to increase the number of GPs who are able to prescribe medical abortions and do you support nurse-led models of care to increase access?

            I think those really are questions that will come up through the stakeholder consultations that Minister Kearney will do, will undertake, so, again, it is too early for me to answer that question directly. But the work where it will intersect with my work is around the national gender equality strategy, and women's health will be a focus of that as well. Essentially, we are doing further work, both on the gender equality strategy and the work that Minister Kearney is dealing with, in terms of access to health services, and further consultations will be held. I know this is an issue that has been raised with me, and it's appropriate that we allow those discussions to happen.

              Research released today also shows an increase in women being subjected to reproductive coercion, including from partners or from counsellors that they seek pregnancy advice from. Will the government address reproductive coercion in the new national plan to end violence against women and their children, and take action to ensure that all pregnancy counselling is unbiased?

               The issue of coercion is dealt with in the national plan. I would have to go back and check. We are currently in the process—minister Rishworth is leading that work and finalising the details, of that plan, after our meeting with state and territory ministers. But the broader issue of coercive control is, absolutely, part of those discussions. I think part of your question would fall into that area, but I'm happy to take further advice on that and come back to the chamber, if I can provide an update.
