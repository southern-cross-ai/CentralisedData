        My question is to the Why did the minister fail to advise Senator Chandler that on this government's watch the number of apprentices and trainees in Tasmania has fallen by 1,190, a drop of more than 12 per cent?

         I really did thank Senator Chandler yesterday for what was an outstanding question on policy—policy that is, in fact, important to the economy. Senator Polley, you may not be aware, but I think that this was articulated exceptionally well by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. On this side of the chamber, let me assure you, we will not take lectures from Labor when it comes to skills—

                 On the point also, Senator Watt—and if I'm in error I will correct myself in the future—I did just hear the minister refer to some numbers in Tasmania. Again, I cannot instruct the minister how to answer a question. If the minister is answering the question asked, and that answer includes references to numbers in Tasmania quoted from a different source, I believe that is directly relevant.

Senator Wong, I do ask that point of orders be raised. On the point of order there, I would remind the minister of the question. I would also remind all others in the chamber that, while interjections are always disorderly—and I say that commonly at this time of the day—if people interject, they can respect the retort from the minister answering the question as well. So I'm not going to rule the minister is out of order, because the minister was responding to an interjection—

                                   On that point of order, the reality is that Senator Cash was entirely directly relevant to the question asked except that she was constantly interrupted by frivolous points of order, which weren't points of order, and persistent interjections.

                                    I'm going to interpret that the minister's comment on a state other than that raised in the question was actually in response to an interjection on multiple occasions. That is my memory of it.

                                    would have caught it all. Other than that, I actually think the minister was being directly relevant. If people don't want ministers to go off on a tangent—I think the minister was being directly relevant. I ruled so when she was talking about apprentice numbers from a different source, being the state government, than the one quoted in the question from Senator Polley. Senator Wong.

And, while they're always disorderly, I am not going to say ministers cannot respond to them when people do not respond to my call for order in the chamber. I have reminded the minister of the question, but I have also ruled her substantive answer, for which a point of order was raised, was directly relevant because she was quoting from a different source about the exact same issue, which was, I believe, the number of apprentices in Tasmania, which was contained in Senator Polley's question. So I will call the minister to continue her answer, ask for no interjections and ask for the discussion to not range north of

                                       As I was saying, if those on the other side actually care about apprentices, they may wish to ask themselves about how, when we introduced the apprentice wage subsidy, it was actually opposed by those on the other side. If you actually care about getting more people into apprenticeships, you would actually back the government's skills agenda, a commitment in excess of half a billion dollars to ensure that Australians are trained for the jobs of today and for the jobs of tomorrow.

                                          As Senator Payne articulated to the chamber, those on the other side left a legacy that comprehensively ripped the guts out of vocational education and training in Australia. In fact, I believe Senator Wong actually sat around the cabinet table when decisions were made to gut over $1.2 billion from employer incentives over just two years. We are committed to vocational education and training in Australia, and—

You ripped $1.2 billion of employer incentives out of the system. Do you know what actually happened? Do you know what happened? As Senator Payne clearly stated, the greatest fall in apprenticeship numbers on record occurred in 2012-13 when the number of apprenticeship commencements fell by 85,000 in one single year. Senator Polley, perhaps your question is better directed to Senator Wong because Senator Wong was actually sitting around the cabinet table at the time, making decisions to rip out of the system $1.2 billion in employer incentives. We are committed to this system and we will do everything that—
