          My motion relates to a $100 billion expenditure on submarines that has had very little scrutiny. I have moved the motion in circumstances where there have been three orders for the production of documents and the Senate has insisted on the provision of the documents but the minister has refused to do so. On two of those occasions, I then went and got an
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
           FOI
          </a>
          whereby the documents were released to me as a regular citizen. That tells you there's something very, very wrong going on here.
         </p>
         <p>
          This motion provides an opportunity for us to debate the minister's latest explanation and to impose a modest sanction if the Senate is not satisfied. This is a lesser motion than a censure but one with symbolic and practical effect. I understand Labor may move to separate this motion. I just ask Labor if they could provide some explanation as to why they wouldn't support enforcing the orders of the Senate?

             On behalf of the Labor Party, I seek leave to separate the motion so that section (3) be voted on separately. In doing so, might I explain that the Labor Party's view is that the orders for the production of documents should be taken seriously and that the proposition as advanced provides for the minister to provide a proper explanation to the Senate as to why this has not been complied with and whether or not additional information can be provided that has not been provided to date, particularly given that the minister is representing a minister from the House of Representatives and that material has been provided to the financial review which hasn't been provided to the Senate. As a party of government, we don't support actions being taken as outlined in section (3) of this motion and we will be voting against it. We would ask that the government take note of that, because what comes around goes around in these circumstances.

The disclosure of this may adversely affect the Commonwealth's ongoing contractual negotiations with Naval Group and the future supply of information or services to the Commonwealth. The release may also affect Australia's international relations, specifically with France.

To use a submarine analogy, it's not a good enough excuse for the Labor Party to come into this place in lock step with the Liberal Party under silent running, not being able to be scrutinised because you're going to be a party of government. That's the whole problem: being in lock step on national security when we're spending hundreds of billions of dollars on critical projects that the Australian people need information about. The more transparency the better, and we applaud Senator Patrick for bringing this motion forward today.

                    Following the wish expressed by the senator, I will be putting paragraphs 1 and 2 of motion No. 981 separately to paragraph 3. So the question is that paragraphs 1 and 2 of motion No. 981 be agreed to.

                    The question is that paragraph 3 of motion No. 981 be agreed to.
