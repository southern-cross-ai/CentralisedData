        My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Watt. Senator, yesterday in your answer to a question about the new drug laws introduced by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Labor, you said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … it is important to recognise that the changes that the ACT have made have been in relation to small quantities of these substances for personal consumption.
       </p>
       <p>
        These laws will allow people to carry up to a gram of heroin or 1.5 grams of ice. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        Department of Justice, that is enough heroin to kill five people, and yet, in the ACT your infringement would be smaller than the fine you would receive for parking outside your space at a shopping centre. Can you please clarify the government's position on how much ice or heroin it is appropriate to carry for personal use, and can you also advise whether other jurisdictions, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales

        , have raised concerns with these laws?

             Senator Askew has referred to part of my answer from yesterday. The majority of my answer yesterday was to point out that this is completely a state and territory issue. Whether or not drug use is criminalised is 100 per cent an issue for state and territory criminal law. As I said yesterday, most of us come to this place to debate serious national matters that concern the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Commonwealth of Australia
             </a>
             . We are, of course, taking the matter of the trafficking of illicit drugs seriously, as I mentioned yesterday. This bill was passed by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
              ACT
             </a>
             Legislative Assembly in October 2022, and a number of Liberal Party members of the ACT parliament voted for that legislation. Most interestingly, this morning on the radio the ACT Liberal leader, Elizabeth Lee, said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The Canberra Liberals will always stand up for territory rights and I am very concerned about any step to diminish that.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             I do not agree with this action taken by the federal Coalition to seek to overturn legislation that was passed by the ACT Assembly.
            </p>
            <p>
             So this stunt from the federal Liberal Party doesn't even have the support of the ACT Liberal Party! Did you pick up the phone and talk to the ACT Liberals before you decided to ask questions about this? Did you pick up the phone and talk to the ACT Liberals before you decided to introduce a stunt of a private senators' bill this morning? Your own party doesn't even support what you are doing. We know you don't have any ACT Liberals in the Senate anymore. You don't even have a Liberal Party member for the ACT in the Senate anymore—

                   President, a point of order: The minister has in the early stages gone to the 'I'm not going to get into a state or territory matter' response yet again. Yet the specific question asked by Senator Askew went very directly to the impact on matters outside of

                   territorial boundaries and the impact on Australian ships, Australian planes and other areas of law enforcement. I ask you draw the minister to the specifics of the question. Thank you, Senator Birmingham. I will draw the minister to the question.

                    for their hard work in ensuring that we keep as many of these substances out of Australia as possible. In fact, there has been an increased effort from the Australian Border Force on these matters. For the 2022-23 financial year, the

                      A further point of order on direct relevance. I appreciate the minister is talking about Commonwealth enforcement in relation to drug trafficking. However, again, the specific question asked by Senator Askew went to the enforcement of these laws and their applicability in other circumstances that are outside the

                           . They've done it to the ACT in relation to euthanasia laws. Now, they're doing it in relation to drug criminalisation laws. It would appear, as I say, that they don't even have support from the ACT Liberal Party when they decide to stomp into this chamber to trample on territory rights. There are other occasions when the federal Liberals have stood up for territory rights. In fact, one of them is sitting right there—Senator Birmingham. It was always anachronistic for the Commonwealth to have decided that the one limitation on the territories compared to the states would be on the questions of voluntary euthanasia or voluntary assisted dying. So there was a time when Senator Birmingham stood up for territory rights, but we know that Senator Birmingham stopped standing up for anything quite a long time ago.
