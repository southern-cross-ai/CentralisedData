        My question is to Senator Carr. I refer him to his embarrassing and rambling answer yesterday. Can the minister inform the Senate exactly how much new money the Labor government has committed to the new square kilometre array, or

         This is a major piece of scientific infrastructure. This is a project of immense importance which this government has determined to pursue with vigour. This is a project which the former government failed to pursue with any vigour and which the former minister for science failed to embrace. This is a project that the former minister chose to ignore, in fact, because the former minister did not appreciate how significant Australia’s role in radioastronomy is, did not appreciate how significant this piece of infrastructure will be to world astronomy, did not appreciate the leading role that Australian radioastronomers have and did not understand the industrial and research implications for this project.

                , I take some relish in answering it. I would have thought that an answer like this should have gone through the government’s tactics committee because it is the sort of question we enjoy answering. It demonstrates that this government is committed to international collaborations on major pieces of research infrastructure. It is true that the previous government did undertake some projects in this area. However, the previous government failed to acknowledge the role of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKA" rel="nofollow">
                 SKA
                </a>
                in terms of its pursuit of international collaboration. It failed to appreciate the significance of this piece of infrastructure. It failed to understand just how significant this piece of infrastructure is for industry and for manufacturing in terms of skills development. This is a project which will last for 50 years; it is a 50-year commitment. This is a project which Australia is uniquely suited to pursue, although I note that the international community will have to choose between Australia and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
                 South Africa
                </a>
                . So the bid is quite important. I invite the opposition to support the government in its determination to secure this project for Australia.

                 , I ask a supplementary question. It ought to be asked of the ‘Minister for Imitation’ because I remind him that the only money that has been committed to this project has been the $105 million committed by the former coalition government. I have a media release from former Minister Bishop indicating exactly that. Is the minister aware that trying to take credit for someone else’s work, plagiarism, is one of the most serious crimes for a scientist or a researcher to commit? Has the minister sought approval from the former science minister, Ms Bishop, to regurgitate her work and take credit for it? As Ms Bishop would say, ‘You’ve been a very naughty boy, Senator Carr, very naughty.’

                    I will check, Senator Brown. I am quite sure that the initial question complied. I am not quite so sure about the supplementary question.

                         to enhance that and additional sums of money have been allocated for that. There is a major international forum to be launched on 9 April in Western Australia with Premier Carpenter. I will be participating in that and we will be pursuing this bid with all the vigour that the Australian government can muster. I would invite the opposition to support this bid.
