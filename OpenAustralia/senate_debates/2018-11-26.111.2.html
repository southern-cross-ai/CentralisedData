         summit, which saw hundreds of meetings, and thousands of visitors, in

          Port Moresby
         </a>
         particularly, over the last year. They have done an outstanding job. I also welcome the release of Prime Minister O'Neill's chair's statement. APEC was a timely opportunity to engage with regional counterparts and to encourage closer economic integration, free trade and investment, and sustainable and inclusive growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was also a very important opportunity to engage leaders on the government's new Pacific initiatives. We are strongly committed to working closely with our Pacific neighbours to build a prosperous and resilient region. As the Prime Minister announced recently, the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific will significantly boost economic development opportunities and help to address major infrastructure financing gaps facing our regional partners. We will be expanding our diplomatic presence to every

         We're focused on strengthening our people-to-people links, which are so powerful between Australia and the Pacific, across a range of activities in sports—including rugby league, rugby union, netball, football and basketball—and at a community level we'll be working to build stronger church partnerships. In fact, I have already met with church leaders to share views on how they could work with Pacific churches further to provide community support and services. These are real demonstrations of our government's commitment to working with our partners across the Indo-Pacific to build a region that is more prosperous, more stable and more secure.

            Senators would be familiar with the government's Pacific step-up, which began in 2016, which puts the region front and centre—because the Pacific is where we live, after all. And as part of these plans we will now also establish an Office of the Pacific to enhance whole-of-government coordination as we deliver on our commitments to strengthen that engagement across the region. The office will bring together officials not just from

            I was also very pleased to announce that we'll expand the Pacific Labour Scheme to all Pacific nations and uncap the number of places offered each year. Uncapping the scheme builds on the powerful success of the uncapped Seasonal Worker Program, which has enabled more than 28,000 job opportunities for Pacific workers in Australia since 2012. They help build the skills and experience of Pacific workers and they provide an important source of income and help regional communities find the workers they need.

                East Asia Summit
               </a>
               in Singapore earlier this month, the Prime Minister announced that Australia will help to develop a new South-East Asia economic governance and infrastructure initiative, which is going to be able to provide countries with technical advice on taxation, competition policy and debt management. It will also support infrastructure project selection and help governments to mobilise finance. At the summit, we also committed to sharing Australian water management expertise with countries on the Mekong and strengthening our engagement on maritime security issues—also matters of great concern. We have signed a trilateral infrastructure
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOU" rel="nofollow">
                MOU

               with Japan and the United States, under which we'll work together to mobilise private capital to help address the region's significant infrastructure needs. This will enable greater opportunities for Australian business.
