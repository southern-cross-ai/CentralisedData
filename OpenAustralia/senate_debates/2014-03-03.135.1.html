        by leave—I rise to correct the record. In answer to a question I received in question time today, I incorrectly stated that I resigned as a director of Australian Water Holdings on 2 November 2011. The correct date is 9 November 2011, as disclosed in my statement of interests when I entered the Senate.

         by leave—I thank Senator Sinodinos for letting me know he was coming in to make that correction. I would make the point that both now and in Senate question time he has failed to answer very significant questions about how it is possible that he played no role in the awarding of the January 2012 contract and no letter has been tabled in the Senate in which he wrote to the Australian Water chairman, as chairman, in relation to the contractual relationship—

           I will take the interjection. He said it was before he entered the Senate. But the statement to the Senate was made as a senator, and that statement was that the minister played no role in the awarding of the contract. He ought to explain how he could have written a letter if he had played no role. He also has not sought to explain how it has been publicly reported that he was in fact in a meeting with Premier O'Farrell's chief of staff about this very issue. If that is the case, how is it possible that that can stack up with the assertion he has made to the Senate, in the chamber, as a part of his statement?

             The minister continues to interject. If he has something to add on this, I invite him—and the opposition will give leave—to stand up and explain those two facts.
