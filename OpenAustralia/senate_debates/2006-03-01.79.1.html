        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs. Is the minister aware of instances where gun collectors and enthusiasts in Australia have purchased gun parts from overseas to have them delivered from door to door without Customs intercepting them? Can the minister confirm that the correct procedure in these cases is for Customs to impound the gun parts at the border? Why are gun enthusiasts who notify Customs with a declaration still having the gun parts delivered to their door? If Customs cannot stop the gun parts, even when they are given advance notice of them by legitimate importers, how easy is it for criminals and potential terrorists to import small arms weaponry unchecked?

         There is a comprehensive regulatory regime in relation to the importation of guns and gun parts. In relation to the transmission of those by post, we have not only stringent regulations but also X-ray facilities. It is in relation to this very issue that gun collectors and gun enthusiasts, legitimate sporting shooters, have approached me about the transmission of gun parts via
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Post
         </a>
         . Indeed, they have complained to me about the fact that Australia Post will not convey these items. I can say that, in relation to any gun parts and guns which are listed, an import permit is required. You can appreciate that in some aspects it is hard to detect if you have merely a spring or one minor part of a gun which is sent in quite separately.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have introduced controls in relation to the importation and ownership of firearms, which no other federal government has introduced hitherto. Indeed, we have worked closely with the states in bringing about as best we can uniform firearms laws, bearing in mind that we have nine different jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth. Recently, at the Australian Police Ministers Council, I put forward again a proposal to have a national firearms management system, which, I am happy to say, was supported by Victoria—but not by many others—to keep a list of all firearms legitimately owned in this country. That would go a long way to assisting law enforcement in controlling the trade in illicit firearms. Customs has in place a rigid regime in relation to the importation of firearms. If Senator Crossin is aware of any particular instance where someone has illegally imported an item or a firearm then I would urge her to bring it to my attention and I will refer it to Customs without delay.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Isn’t it the case that some 2.4 million parcels enter this country unscreened, through couriers like
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHL" rel="nofollow">
           DHL
          </a>
          and FedEx? What is the point of having strong gun laws at the state level if the Howard government’s weak border protection lets firearms into the country unchecked, through those couriers?

           We have 100 per cent screening of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
            Australia Post
           </a>
           . In relation to air cargo, it is about 70 per cent. I might say that the source of illicit firearms is more domestic. I urge Senator Crossin to look at the recent case in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           where a gun dealer was dealt with by law enforcement authorities for the diversion of a very large number of firearms. In my home state of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           , a gun dealer was convicted in relation to hundreds of firearms which were illegally diverted. That is where you should look for the source of illicit firearms in this country. We are doing everything possible at the border to keep out illicit weapons and we will continue to do so.
