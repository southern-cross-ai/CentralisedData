        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy, Senator Gallagher. The auto industry released modelling to show Labor's family car tax on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV" rel="nofollow">
         SUV
        </a>
        s, four-wheel drives and utes could impose penalties of up to $25,000 on the cost of a new car. For example, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAV" rel="nofollow">
         RAV
        </a>
        4 would be slugged up to $11,000 under Labor's car tax, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Ranger" rel="nofollow">
         Ford Ranger
        </a>
        ute by nearly $18,000. During the middle of a cost-of-living crisis and high inflation, why is the government trying to force Australians who want or need an SUV or a four-wheel drive to pay more when buying their next family car?

         Well, I must say, there isn't a policy area with a fear campaign that the Liberal and National parties don't want to jump on board of and promote. Instead of working in the national interest, it's always about the scare campaign. It's always about misinformation. It's always about trying to drive fear and disunity against the need to make progress in relation to climate change. They will jump on everything they can and perpetuate these myths.

         For the record, we are currently consulting on a New Vehicle Efficiency Standard. Here's a quote:

          A point of order on relevance. I asked not about the fuel efficiency standard itself but about the industry modelling that says the cost of new family cars will be increased by significant amounts. Is industry right or not?

            , the most popular models before introduction stayed the most popular models after introduction … what we'd call utes …There wasn't a material change in price and we don't expect that there would be a material change in price here.

            That goes directly to your question. Who said that? The member for Bradfield! What happened to him? That's when those opposite used to believe in fuel efficiency standards.

                    We are consulting on a policy now. We have three options, and feedback is being provided—and we've taken some of your feedback today, Senator

                    —until 4 March. What I would say is that Australia stands alone. We've been left by 10 years of inaction from your government, despite people supporting it. What's the other developed country that doesn't have fuel efficiency standards? Which is it? Oh, it's a country led by

                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So what have you got against us trying to put in place standards that drive down the cost of fuel, make cars more efficient and ensure that people are paying less for the running of their cars? What does the National Party have against more efficiency and lower costs for people when running their cars? They're currently paying too much, and they shouldn't be.

                         This is about putting in place a new vehicle standard that will allow Australians to have more choice and pay less for fuel. And Toyota has announced they're launching a new, fully-electric

                          SUV

                         —there we go!—the bZ4X, today. We welcome more choice for Australian consumers. Of course, if you want a petrol SUV, you will still be able to buy one. And we will continue working on the case, with a fuel efficiency standard.

                        <p>
                         But I say to the Liberal and National parties: stop the scare campaign. For once, act in the interests of consumers in this country, about getting access to choice, driving better vehicles into this country, encouraging greater fuel efficiency and lowering costs for drivers in this country. You should be getting behind this standard, just like Mr Fletcher, Senator Sharma and your former Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg.
