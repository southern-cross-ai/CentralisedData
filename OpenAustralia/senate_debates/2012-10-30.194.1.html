         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) (a) The original 1.5 per cent efficiency dividend has reduced the department's operating appropriation by approximately $55 million in 2012-13.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) The additional 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend has reduced the department's operating appropriation by $92 million in 2012-13 (the department's Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements 2011-12, page 17).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) The department's operating appropriation in 2012-13 has been reduced by $2.540 million for the following measures (see 2012-13 Budget Paper No. 2):
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         Further information on these measures can be found in the 2012-13 Budget Paper No. 2.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The department's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Executive Committee
         </a>
         has oversight of and monitors the department's financial position. Monthly reports are provided to the Executive Committee on expenditure and forecasts against budget.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The department estimates that 63.1 per cent of total expenses budget is represented by staffing costs in 2012-13. The percentage equates to the proportion of total budgeted employee expenses ($2.789 billion) to the total expenses budget ($4.423 billion) as per the department's Portfolio Budget Statements 2012-13 (page 38).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) (a) A net reduction in staff is expected for the financial year.
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASL" rel="nofollow">
          ASL
         </a>
         is the average number of employees receiving salary/wages over the reporting period, with adjustments for casual and part-time employees to show the full-time equivalent (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTE" rel="nofollow">
          FTE
         </a>
         ). Therefore ASL is the average paid FTE for the financial year. ASL is a different calculation to the FTE figure reported in question 6.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) A net reduction in contractor and consultant costs is expected for the financial year, however, the department is unable to quantify the reduction in financial terms at this time.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) (a) As at 4 October 2012, there have been 358 voluntary redundancies in the 2012–13 financial year. At this stage the number of voluntary redundancies expected in the remainder of the financial year is unknown.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) The department does not expect any involuntary redundancies in the 2012-13 financial year.
