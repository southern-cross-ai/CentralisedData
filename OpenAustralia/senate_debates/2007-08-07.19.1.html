         I thank Senator Nash for the question. Senator Nash has a longstanding interest in regional and rural telecommunications services and, indeed, this issue. The government has, of course, welcomed Telstra’s investment in its new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_G" rel="nofollow">
          Next G
         </a>
         network. When it is fully operational it will allow people living in rural and regional Australia to gain further access to next generation telecommunications services, such as video calling and internet access. Telstra has given public assurances that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDMA" rel="nofollow">
          CDMA
         </a>
         network will continue to operate until the Next G network provides equivalent coverage and services.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, I have spent the past six weeks on the road across Australia and it is clear that there is a great deal of concern regarding the current performance of the new network. I have heard loud and clear from regional and rural Australians themselves that the Next G network is well short of being up to scratch. I have therefore decided to impose a licence condition on Telstra that will require it to maintain the CDMA network in operation until Telstra makes good its promise that the Next G services will provide the same or better coverage and services as the CDMA network. It is important to understand that, under this licence condition, a delay to the closure of the CDMA network would occur only if Telstra fails to meet its own public commitment. Telstra has said that it will not be able to say whether it has delivered equivalent or better coverage until 15 October, which is much later than previously indicated. Given that 12 weeks are needed to complete an audit, this is simply not enough time to ensure that Telstra has met its public commitments prior to the planned shutdown of the network on 28 January 2008.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, I have created a Next G customer support unit within my department to receive feedback on performance and service issues with Next G, direct from consumers, of course. The Next G customer support unit is available through free-call 1800883488 and will ensure that concerns are monitored and followed up directly with Telstra’s management.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Howard government makes no apologies for putting consumers first when considering the regulation of Australia’s telecommunications industry. This stands in stark contrast to the performance of Labor when they succumb to the switch-off of the analog network without even a thought about having a replacement network in place. The Howard government understands that good mobile coverage is not an optional extra; it is a vitally important service for people in regional and rural Australia in particular—indeed, anywhere in Australia. But people living in regional and rural Australia can be assured that the Howard government has stepped up to the plate to look after them and their families and will ensure that this vital service is maintained.
