         I thank Senator Fawcett for his question. As I told the Senate yesterday,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         's training sector and, more importantly, the skills and employment market face dire consequences as a result of the new WorkReady policy that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         Labor government is applying. It strips choice away from students and employers in South Australia. Guaranteeing 90 per cent of places solely to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         sector is a significant backward step to the more than 70 per cent level of contestability that used to exist in South Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The real concern there is that we will see two major impacts on employment—a direct impact for registered training organisations, with estimates of around 10,000 potential job losses as a result of this decision; but then, of course, a further impact throughout the rest of the economy as a result of the fact that there will be fewer skilled workers available, less choice for students and employers in where to go to access their training. This comes at the worst of all possible times for South Australia, with confirmation last week that South Australia now has the unhappy record of having the highest unemployment rate in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         But you should compare this,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , with what has happened elsewhere in the country. In the period since the Weatherill government was re-elected, unemployment has gone down in Queensland, unemployment has gone down in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , unemployment has gone down in Victoria and unemployment has gone down in Tasmania. While all of those states have managed to get unemployment down, since the Weatherill government was re-elected unemployment has gone up in South Australia to the highest in the nation, because they are not getting the policy settings right for South Australia and this new WorkReady policy will only compound that problem and create greater employment difficulties for

                What we see from the state government in relation to their new work ready policy is great inconsistency when it comes to the announcement they have just made that they want to try and reinvest in international education. International education is a huge industry. It is our fourth largest export industry, our largest services industry, and is worth nearly $1 billion to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                 South Australia
                </a>
                n economy alone. But at the same time as saying that they want to reinvest—they have backflipped on previous cuts there—they are implementing a policy that will dramatically harm choice in relation to domestic students. By shutting out many domestic students you harm the existence of those training providers. Without a strong domestic market we simply will not have quality providers there to compete for those international students. Eighty-five per cent of international
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
                 VET
                </a>
                students choose a private provider, but those private providers will simply lose their domestic base under this new policy regime.
