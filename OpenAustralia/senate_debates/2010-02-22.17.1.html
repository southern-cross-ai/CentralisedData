        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib. As the minister responsible for stimulus plan work opportunities, when did the minister first become aware of the inadequate training and safety issues for workers involved in the ill-fated home insulation program?

         I thank the good senator for the question. In my role as, firstly, the parliamentary secretary for our government’s service delivery but also as the then Minister for Employment Participation, I have done everything possible, as has Minister Garrett and as has his department, to ensure that adequate safety arrangements have been in place for the home insulation program. These issues of training were identified from day one. It was clear that it was necessary for adequate training to be put in place and the minister responsible made a number of decisions throughout the term of the program to ensure that adequate safety arrangements were in place. In terms of the question of when I was aware that training was going to be necessary, it was from day one, because it was clear to anybody involved that this sector had been completely unregulated and that training was required for those workers who were moving into the sector.

         also say how saddened I was that the program was forced to shut. This will result in the loss of many jobs. While those on the other side of the chamber, the Liberal Party and National Party senators, can skite about the home insulation package, I do not and will do everything possible to stand by those workers who have lost their jobs to ensure they have training, to ensure they—

           , I ask a supplementary question. Is it true that the minister, as the then Parliamentary Secretary for Government Service Delivery, attended weekly briefings on the development of the home insulation program? Did he make himself aware of the contents of the risk assessment or risk register prepared by Minter Ellison, and if so when?

            Yes, I can confirm to the Senate that I was involved in meetings and I met regularly in my role with all departments and all ministerial officers involved in the rollout of the stimulus package. A line of communication was created between the Commonwealth and state governments and obviously the coordinator-general. In relation to the report, in the past week my office has checked its records and I can advise that neither I nor my staff had seen the report prior to my office receiving it on 12 February this year. I do not hide from the fact that I was present at discussions concerning risk in the home insulation program, along of course with Minister Garrett, along with his staff and along with his department. Of course, that would be the appropriate thing to do: manage risk, try to ensure that the program worked—

              Throughout the entire process the government—Minister Garrett, his staff and his department—were 100 per cent committed to establishing and maintaining a robust compliance and audit program as well as managing the risks that go along with any program.
