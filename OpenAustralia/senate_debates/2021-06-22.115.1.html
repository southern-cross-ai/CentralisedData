           The coalition government abhors discrimination and is committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of every young Australian. The clinical treatment of children experiencing gender dysphoria is a complex and evolving field, and state and territory governments are being encouraged to work to develop a nationally consistent approach to best practice treatment with appropriate safeguards. The government has acknowledged the diversity of perspectives that senators in the broader community bring to this debate in good faith. This was reflected in the decision to allow coalition senators a conscience vote on an earlier motion.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government believes schools should be not be permitted to discriminate against students or staff on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The government has stated that any changes to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Sex Discrimination Act
           </a>
           should make clear that discrimination against students and staff is unacceptable while ensuring religious educational institutions can teach in a manner consistent with the tenets of their faith.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government will engage with

           groups and will undertake thorough consultation ahead of any future reforms of Australia's antidiscrimination laws. Assertions that the rights of LGBTIQ Australians have been or will be undermined or wound back are without foundation. It is the view of coalition senators—

              does not support this motion, as it misrepresents the intentions behind One Nation's stance on protecting our children. All children, including those who present with gender dysphoria, have a right to therapeutic and medical care. Therapeutic care is underutilised for children presenting with gender dysphoria. Children should not be put on a medical pathway with irreversible outcomes. It is not helpful to all children who need support to label everyone who disagrees with Senator Rice's world view as being transphobic. That will never address the anguish that these children and parents face. It will suppress alternative views. It is subtle censorship based on trying to shame people whose views differ. One Nation supports an inclusive approach because we do not carve out special groups to protect at the expense of others. Inclusiveness starts with a state of mind, and a thousand variations on a man and a woman will never include everyone as long as there are those who choose to identify as a victim first.
