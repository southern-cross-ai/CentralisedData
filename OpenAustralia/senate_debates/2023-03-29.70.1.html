        I rise today to acknowledge and remember the life of another great Territorian, Alison Hunt, who was also a family member of my own. Alison, sadly, lost her life to cancer earlier this month.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alison was born in Areyonga, west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        , in 1948. After her mother, sadly, passed away, she was adopted by Wilfred and Lucy Swift and their daughters—Alison's sisters—Audrey and Amy. She remained grateful to her family her entire life. She grew up in Areyonga and Hermannsburg enjoying her childhood surrounded by friends and family. Alison was a much loved grandmother and aunty. She had committed her life to Johnny and to her three children: Julieanne, Kathleen and Steven—who, sadly, passed away in 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alison was a real leader in her community and was described by her family as a 'fierce, outspoken woman' who was not afraid to fight for what she believed in. Alison's life was about bringing people together. An excellent communicator, she dedicated her life to helping people understand each other, to closing the gap and to inviting people from all walks of life to understand her culture.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alison was civically engaged her whole life and took a keen interest in politics, understanding the need for the community to work together to improve the lives of all Australians. She was a big supporter of the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        When she passed away, Alison was surrounded by her family, which is exactly how she would have wanted it. She will be remembered and missed by all.
