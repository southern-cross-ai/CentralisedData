        My question is to Senator Santoro, the Minister representing the Minister for Ageing. Will the minister outline to the Senate what the Howard government is doing to help the elderly Indigenous in our community? Could the minister also inform the Senate of any recent announcements specific to my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         In stating from the outset that this is very good news, could I acknowledge the longstanding and sincere interest and advocacy by Senator Eggleston in relation to the interests and affairs of Indigenous communities, particularly in his home state of WA.

         The Howard government will provide an additional 150 places and $15.1 million over four years under the recently announced expansion of the National Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         Aged Care Strategy. This national strategy provides a culturally appropriate and flexible approach to the delivery of aged care services for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , many of whom reside in rural and remote Australia. The contractual arrangements ensure the delivery of culturally appropriate, quality care that is provided in consultation with the target community.
        </p>
        <p>
         This arrangement is consistent with the views expressed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities that were consulted when the national strategy commenced, and which emphasised their desire for autonomy and self-management in the planning and operation of aged care services for their communities. I intend visiting Indigenous communities to discuss the national strategy and consult with providers about possible changes to ensure that the program remains responsive and continues to deliver quality, appropriate aged care to Indigenous Australians.

         In response to the second part of Senator Eggleston’s question, I was pleased to announce earlier today that the Kimberley region in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         will benefit from a new Indigenous 55-bed high- and low-care facility to be built in Broome. The Howard government will provide $12.83 million and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         government will provide $1.52 million towards the cost of construction. I would like to publicly acknowledge the role that Senator Eggleston played in advocating for the establishment of this facility. In fact, his was one of the very first representations that I received shortly after I was appointed minister. The member for Kalgoorlie,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Haase" rel="nofollow">
          Barry Haase
         </a>
         , also deserves credit for his advocacy in this matter, as do all other senators, including my ministerial colleagues, representing Western Australia. They have backed up Senator Eggleston’s advocacy and that of Mr Haase very strongly.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was also pleased to announce today that the Howard government will provide $4.353 million towards the construction of a 64-bed high- and low-care residential aged care facility in Collie in Western Australia. I would like to acknowledge in this place the strong representations by the member for Forrest,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Prosser" rel="nofollow">
          Geoff Prosser
         </a>
         , made to me on behalf of the Collie community, which he represents with great vigour and distinction. I would also like to acknowledge—as I always do whenever anybody on the other side makes a contribution—that the Labor government in Western Australia will contribute $4 million towards the project. I think that that is a significant and welcome contribution to the people within that community. These commitments recognise the fact that some aged care facilities in rural and remote Western Australia need assistance to ensure their financial viability. These announcements are good examples of the Howard government working constructively with the states to provide world-class, affordable and accessible services that meet the needs of older Australians and, in this particular case, with a very strong emphasis on Indigenous older Australians.
