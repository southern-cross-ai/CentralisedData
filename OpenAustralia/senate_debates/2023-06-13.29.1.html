        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. I refer the minister to her statement to the Senate earlier today regarding knowledge of the sexual assault allegations made by Ms Brittany Higgins, in which the minister stated that she 'was provided with information in the days before the allegations were first reported'. Minister, when precisely did you first learn of any aspect of the allegations?

         I thank Senator Birmingham for the question. I don't have the exact date, but I believe that the details that were provided to me were in the week before—in the days before—the Brittany Higgins allegations went public. It was around that time.

            The first I knew of the details of the allegations, from my best recollection—I have gone back to try and find any information that would assist with being more precise, but, from my best recollection, I became aware of the specific allegations, as they related to an alleged rape in a minister's office in this building, in the week prior to those shows being published.

               From my memory, it was at around the same time. I wasn't aware, for example, of other things that people knew in this place. I wasn't aware of any of that and that people had known for some time. I had no knowledge of any of that. I came into receiving some information through the partner of the young woman who was going to raise those allegations. It was put to me and asked of me to keep that information confidential, and I did.
