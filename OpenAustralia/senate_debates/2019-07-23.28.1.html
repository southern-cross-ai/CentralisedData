        My question is to the Minister for Defence. Can the minister update the Senate on how the government is getting on with the job of securing our nation through our defence engagement in the Pacific?

         I thank Senator Askew for that question. I also note how much I enjoy working with her on defence research and academic work in Tasmania. Thank you. Australia does have a longstanding defence relationship with the Pacific island nations. They're our neighbours and they are our friends. This is because Australia and the Pacific island countries recognise that a stable, secure and prosperous region is in all of our interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over many years we have made an enduring contribution for the security of the region through our defence cooperation. This contribution is clearly seen in the Pacific Maritime Security Program. This program, which builds on the success of the Pacific island boat program, has three main parts. It includes new patrol boats, 21 across the Pacific and Timor-Leste; it includes a program of region-wide aerial surveillance; and it includes enhancements to the way the region works together, through support for the forum fisheries agency.
        </p>
        <p>
         This program will help Pacific island nations to protect their own sovereignty. By being better positioned to provide for their own security, they will be able to protect their natural resources and protect their prosperity. The Defence Cooperation Program broadly provides training and support to the security and defence forces in the region by engaging with our partners in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, as part of the Pacific step-up, Defence is doing even more in the region. We're increasing our maritime and land presence to conduct training activities with Pacific island military and security forces. We're convening an annual joint heads of Pacific security event here in Australia, reinforcing alumni networks in the security sector and, most importantly, expanding sporting engagements, which I know my colleague will greatly appreciate.

            are close neighbours, and we are even closer friends. Australia's commitment to this relationship is shown through the strength of our Defence Cooperation Program. The Australia Papua New Guinea Defence Cooperation Program is our largest globally, standing at more than $40 million per annum. Under this program, the

            conduct a significant program of activities together. These include exercises and operations, mentoring and training, maritime engagement, capability development, infrastructure development and also more general capacity building. Yesterday, I was greatly honoured to engage with my counterpart from Papua New Guinea, the Hon. Saki Soloma, their Minister for Defence. Minister Soloma and I discussed how we can drive greater defence cooperation together as part of the new comprehensive strategic and economic partnership agreed by both of our prime ministers yesterday.

               Yes, I can. What we've agreed is that, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of our defence cooperation program, Australia will provide a new package of initiatives to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
                Papua New Guinea
               </a>
               . This package is valued at $20 million and will continue to build on the breadth and depth of our enduring defence partnership. The initiatives will focus on building a minimum sustainable
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
                PNG
               </a>
               capability. There will be four main components to this assistance. Firstly, we have committed to supporting PNG to build a balanced and sustainable aviation capability. Secondly, we have committed to an expanded maritime security partnership. Thirdly, we have committed to building an infrastructure investment program. Fourthly, we will support PNG's vision to build a force for the future. It is indeed fitting, in the 40th year of our defence cooperation, that we elevate our deep and enduring partnership together.
