        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. On Tuesday the Prime Minister told his colleagues, 'Never go to Lima for the weekend.' What exactly when wrong while the Prime Minister was in Lima? Was the Prime Minister referring to the Deputy Prime Minister declaring war on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan?

         If the Prime Minister said that, I am sure he would not have been reflecting on Peruvian tourism. But, as you raised the matter, the Prime Minister's attendance at the

           Yes, that was not the question; the question was very specific: what exactly went wrong while the Prime Minister was in Lima? Was the Prime Minister referring to the Deputy Prime Minister declaring war on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan? It had nothing to do with the reason he was there.

            Senator Polley, you had two parts to your question. The first part was what went wrong when the Prime Minister was in Lima. The Attorney-General has been discussing what happened in Lima, and so far he is indicating that nothing went wrong.

             The point I was trying to make to Senator Polley is that nothing went wrong in Lima; everything went right, because it gave Australia and it gave the leader of Australia the opportunity for long discussions with the President of the United States, with

               Yes, I do have a supplementary question. In fact, I agree partly with Senator Brandis, because everything went wrong here. But was the Prime Minister referring to the Nationals rebellion against the ban on the import of the Adler A110 shotgun?

                 Senator Polley, you asked me about what happened in Lima and whether anything went wrong in Lima, and I am telling you that Australia's representation at Lima by the Prime Minister was enormously successful. Now, particularly in view of some of the observations that have come from the President-Elect of the United States of America, of course it was important that Australia's voice be heard in that forum to reaffirm our commitment to free trade and the greater integration of the economies of our region. And you may seek to make light of it, Senator Polley, but for the Prime Minister of Australia to have the opportunity for long meetings with, for example, President Xi of China and Prime Minister Abe of Japan, was extremely helpful and extremely beneficial to Australia.

                        Once again, Senator Polley, you might think that is a laughing matter. I actually do not happen to think it is a laughing matter.

It was an entirely successful visit.
