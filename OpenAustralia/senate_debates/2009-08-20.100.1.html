        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Carr. Can the minister update the Senate on developments relating to the Gorgon liquefied natural gas project off the coast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia

        : what is the export potential of this project and, in particular, what is the potential for sales to our trading partners in the Asia-Pacific area; what other benefits can Australia expect from this project; what are the implications for local workers and firms; what does the project mean for the domestic supply of gas in Western Australia; how much government revenue is the project expected to generate; and how might this revenue be applied?

                 Under the agreement, the Gorgon joint venture will export some $50 billion worth of liquid natural gas to China. A week earlier,

                  Exxon Mobil
                 </a>
                 and Petronet signed a multibillion dollar deal to supply Gorgon

                  LPG
                 </a>
                 to India. This confirms the strength of Australia’s trade and investment relationship with these two economic giants of our region. It also confirms Australia’s continued status as a global energy superpower supplying clean energy to the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On Monday the Commonwealth and the government of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  Western Australia
                 </a>
                 announced that they will jointly accept any long-term liability arising from the storage of carbon dioxide associated with the Gorgon project. This clears the way for the joint venturers—Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Shell—to make a final investment decision before the end of the year. Economic modelling undertaken by the joint venturers suggests that overall the Gorgon project will create some 6,000 jobs in the construction phase and 3,500 ongoing jobs over the life of the project.

                    , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister inform the Senate what the Gorgon joint venturer is doing to ensure that Australian firms have full, fair and reasonable opportunity to participate in the project? Does the project have an Australia industry participation plan and if so, how is this plan being implemented? Has the Commonwealth provided funding or other support to facilitate the involvement of local suppliers? What role is the Industry Capability Network playing in assisting the joint venture to implement the plan? Does the plan meet the government’s objective of giving local suppliers—

                     , on a point of order: the new plan in here is for a two-minute answer to the first question and a one-minute answer to subsequent questions. There were eight questions in the senator’s first question to the minister, and we are now at the sixth or so. It is simply impossible to answer so many questions. I ask if you would take note of these questions and report back to the Senate. I ask you to report on whether or not it is feasible for eight questions to be answered in two minutes or six questions to be answered in one minute. There needs to be some reason brought into the process.

This is a great example of what the government is trying to achieve through the new Australian industry participation package.

                             . Can the minister give the Senate more information on the government’s Australian industry participation package? What is the value of the package, what is its purpose and what benefits is it expected to bring? What are the main elements of the package and how will they be implemented to give local firms the opportunity to compete for and win work both domestically and internationally? Will the package apply to both public sector and private sector—

                                 . The government has announced $19.1 million for an Australian industry participation package which is designed to get more local firms involved in major projects and procurements both at home and abroad. The money will be used to identify existing capabilities, build new ones, and match those capabilities to new opportunities. The package includes an extra $8.5 million for the Industry Capability Network, which links firms with opportunities; $8.2 million to supply advocates to champion Australian industry and to improve competitiveness; and $2.5 million to extend the use of Australia’s industry participation plans to major Commonwealth contracts and projects. This is about giving Australian firms a fair go. It is about ensuring that people are encouraged to buy Australian, both at home and abroad.
