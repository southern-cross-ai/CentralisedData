           The Australian government acknowledges that access to renal dialysis in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Central Australia
           </a>
           is a major issue. Dialysis services are predominantly administered by state and territory governments. The Australian government funding arrangement with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           government provides for a boost in the capacity of renal services in the Northern Territory.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            The Northern Territory
           </a>
           government is responsible for the ongoing operation and management of facilities and resources established through these arrangements, and this includes the management of patient flows and demands. This requirement is consistent with the arrangements under the National Healthcare Agreement, as agreed by all states and territories, which allows states and territories the flexibility to administer tertiary services in a manner to suit their local needs. It is not up to the Australian government to dictate to states and territories exactly how they run their services.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am aware the Northern Territory government has implemented protocols to refer new patients presenting for treatment in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
            Alice Springs
           </a>
           who are non-residents of the Northern Territory to their state of residence for treatment. The Northern Territory Department of Health and Families have advised that this decision was necessary due to delays in establishing the new 12-port renal facility in Alice Springs and the substantial increase in patients in Central Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           Given the importance of this issue and the significant investments the Australian government has made towards Northern Territory renal services, we are taking an active role in resolving the current situation. The Northern Territory government is developing a proposal, to be tabled at a summit scheduled for 4 December 2009, seeking an ongoing commitment and contribution from the WA and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           n governments to establish a sustainable long-term plan for the provision of renal services in Central Australia. Australian government representatives will be attending the summit to urge the Northern Territory, South Australia and WA governments to find a solution as soon as possible, in recognition of the high demand for dialysis services in Alice Springs.

              That is complete cop-out from the federal government. The fact is that there are currently patients in
