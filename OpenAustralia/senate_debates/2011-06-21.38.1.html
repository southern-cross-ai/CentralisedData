        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. I am sure the minister is aware of the Respect the Science campaign, launched last night by the Federation of Australian Science and Technology Societies. Can the minister advise what he is doing to respond to the concerns of Australian scientists?

         I thank Senator Stephens for her question and her longstanding commitment to Australian science. There has been a very important moment to affirm our respect for science. There has never been a more important moment in which to do so. It has almost been four centuries since the passing of the Enlightenment but, by now, you would have thought—

            What I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by the knuckle-draggers on the other side of this chamber is that you would have thought that after four centuries the whole question of the Enlightenment would have seen the light from science penetrate every part of the body politic of this country. But what we find in this building, in this opposition, is that there are some very dimly-lit corners today. There are those on the other side of the chamber who would be only too happy to drag us back to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages" rel="nofollow">
             Dark Ages
            </a>
            . What we have is a government on this side that is committed to ensuring that we stand for reason, we stand for scientific method and we stand for the maximum discovery in science. What we see on the other side of the chamber is an opposition that runs from the facts, that peddles in fear and seeks to, wherever it can, rely upon innuendo and undermine the importance of scientific method in this country. We must recommit, in this country, to ensure that when the cameras stop rolling we still argue the case for the importance of science. We make no apology for the search for truth when it comes to the issues of scientific discovery.

               Every friend of Australian science was dismayed by the reports that Senator Stephens refers to. Such behaviour is contemptible and has no place in Australia and yet we have seen those threats dismissed by some in this building as nothing more than a mere contest of ideas. It is as if to say there is nothing wrong with the behaviour that we have seen in parts of this country. This government sees a difference between robust debate and downright abuse of our scientists. The government sees a difference between peer review and fearmongering. This government will not pretend that the earth is flat no matter how convenient it would be for some on the other side of this chamber to have us believe it. For this government, the choice is clear. We respect the science and we call on you to change your ways and respect the science too.

                  I am really quite disturbed that so few opposition senators have chosen to participate in Science meets Parliament. The fact remains that curiosity-driven research is important but so is the importance of providing answers to the big questions facing our society. We are in the business of building the tools to power the nation in the 21st century. And if we look at our phenom­enal potential with new technology, we do not have to go much further than the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
                   CSIRO
                  </a>
                  . It estimates that supply of around 30 per cent of Australian energy will be able to be provided through renewable energy sources. This will not be done without our scientists. They will not be able to get the investment they need without a carbon price, and they will not be able to do this without ensuring that we respect their contribution to Australia's future development.
