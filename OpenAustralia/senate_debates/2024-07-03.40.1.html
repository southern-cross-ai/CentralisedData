        This week more cost-of-living relief is being delivered for Australians. This week tax cuts for 13.6 million workers have been delivered, with an average of $1,800 going a year back into household budgets. This week our $300 in energy bill relief comes into effect, $325 for small businesses. And this week 2.6 million workers on the minimum wage are receiving their third consecutive pay rise, so Australians can earn more and keep more of what they earn.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week paid parental leave will expand to 22 weeks in total for families, and it will keep going up each year until we hit 26 weeks. This week PBS medicine costs are being frozen for Australians, meaning no-one will pay more than $31.60 for a PBS script. This week Australians remember that those opposite opposed every cost-of-living measure on offer. 'No' to tax cuts for all Australians, not just some. 'No' to getting wages moving. 'No' to cheaper medicines. 'No' to energy bill relief. And, what's worse, those opposite want to push up electricity prices with their half-baked nuclear plan. They have nothing to offer Australians to ease the cost of living.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, our measures are responding to the pressure households are under, without adding to inflation. We know there is more work to do. But, after a decade of inaction from those opposite, we are getting wages moving in this country. We are cutting taxes in this country. And we're providing the support that Australians need.
