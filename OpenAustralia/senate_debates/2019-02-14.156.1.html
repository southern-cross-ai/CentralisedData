            Any statements I made were based on the information that I held at the time. But I would also say to Senator Collins, as I've said already many times in this chamber, you are presenting me with evidence that I am not able to verify and therefore cannot comment on.

               I rise on a point of order. I appreciate that Senator Collins or her advisers would have drafted the supplementary before the answer was given but that is not actually a supplementary question in the context of the answers provided by the minister because you are making the precise opposite assertion to what the minister actually said in her primary answer. And you are asserting something that is 180 degrees different to what the minister said in response to the primary question.

                   On the point of order, there is no use of unparliamentary language that I can immediately recall—my handwriting is pretty bad, writing it down. I will reflect to see if there is any imputation that is covered by the standing orders. I didn't hear one. However, in responding to this supplementary question, which must be relevant to a previous question or previous answer given—and I do believe it to be relevant to a previous question asked—the minister is entirely in order to challenge the assertion made in the question and that would be directly relevant. I don't believe it rules it out of order. But the minister is free to address the assertion and be entirely in order, even if it is not the answer that the asker would request. Senator Cash.
