        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. Yesterday the Minister for Defence warned the now independent member for Chisholm, Julia Banks, that she would 'face the consequences of her actions'. Will the minister rule out retaliations against the now Independent member for Chisholm?

           In her statement to the House of Representatives yesterday, the now Independent member for Chisholm, Ms Banks, called for the ability to report 'misconduct of those in power without fear of reprisal or retribution'. Are the threats made by Minister Pyne the kind of reprisal and retribution that Ms Banks was referring to?

               I think it's well established that statements by ministers are relevantly the subject of questions at question time. This minister is representing the Minister for Defence. These are questions relating to public statements made by the Minister for Defence, and this is a question about what they meant.

                On the point of order, it's longstanding practice that ministers can be asked about public statements made. In this case, it is a public statement of a minister who is represented in this chamber. That is also in order. With respect to your comment about the ability of a minister to answer a question, questioners are to take that into account when writing their questions. Obviously there are limitations on the ability of people to answer on behalf of others. I call Senator Payne.

                 I make two points. I don't have the advantage of having the statements in front of me to which
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_McCarthy" rel="nofollow">
                  Senator McCarthy
                 </a>
                 is referring. Certainly one would always wish, in a workplace and more broadly, that if, concerns need to be raised in relation to behaviours or other matters, then they can be raised in an appropriate way without fear or, frankly, favour. I would make that observation. Secondly, again, not having seen the statements to which Senator McCarthy has referred, I can say that as sentient adults, by and large, in this place, we all face the consequences of our actions.

                     This question asks the defence minister what Mr Morrison, as Prime Minister, might do or not do. It's clearly addressed to the wrong person. It's not a supplementary of the previous question. I ask you to rule it out of order.

                          On the point of order, respectfully, this was not a supplementary question. It did not, in any way, refer to the substance of the first or second question or an answer given by the minister to either of those questions. However, I have previously stated that, even when questions are not in order, so as to not create an incentive for statements to be made without the minister having an opportunity to respond, I will invite the minister to respond if they have anything to say to the question, despite it not being in order.

                           Coming from the side that talks about its own leadership as 'lobotomised zombies', that's pretty rich. Nevertheless, let me tell you what the Prime Minister will be talking to Australians about when we go to the election. He'll be talking about the fact Australia's economy is growing at 3.4 per cent, more strongly than at any other time since 2012. He'll be talking about us meeting our promise of the creation of one million new jobs by businesses in this country, supported by government. He'll be talking about the fact more Australians are finding jobs and that the percentage of working-age Australians on welfare has fallen to 15.1 per cent—the lowest rate of welfare dependency in over 25 years. He'll be talking about the fact that we're making income taxes lower, fairer and simpler—

I listened to her intently. She has not stopped shouting at the Minister for Defence. I usually try to stop her, but I have taken notice of what you've said,

                               In furtherance to Senator Macdonald's point of order: I'm sitting right behind the minister and I couldn't hear a word she was saying. However, I did hear Senator Wong refer to the minister not in accordance with her title. I think, in accordance with what you said this morning, due respect needs to be paid and the correct title should be used.

                                 I'm sorry I called her 'Marise', but I often do call her 'Marise', and it was across the chamber. If you want me to call her 'Senator Payne' or 'Minister', I'm happy to do so. It's interesting that that's the issue you wish to take a point of order on, not what Senator O'Sullivan said, Senator Reynolds.

                                   As I was saying, the Prime Minister will be taking the message to the electorate that we are making taxes lower, fairer and simpler, that we have delivered tax relief for 3.3 million businesses in this country, that we are ensuring less red tape and that we are determining that Australians have more affordable energy and a whole range of other things.
