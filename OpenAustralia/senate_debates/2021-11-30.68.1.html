        , in 2015, Mr Morrison removed the exemption for parents who are conscientious objectors to children's vaccinations, implementing what he called 'No Jab, No Play' and 'No Jab, No Pay'. This month, Mr Morrison declared it was time for governments to step back and that he wasn't in favour of mandatory vaccines. Can the minister clarify what Mr Morrison's position on the vaccination of children is?

         I thank Senator Smith for the question, and it's a very important question. The No Jab, No Play policy worked very effectively, and continues to work very effectively, to encourage Australia to meet and to achieve some of the highest rates of childhood vaccination and immunisation in the world. The policy was implemented after it had been identified that there were areas of decline occurring in relation to childhood vaccination, that those areas of decline were obvious in particular communities around the country and that it was crucial to create stronger incentives for people to make the decision and the choice to have their children vaccinated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pleasingly, those policies have worked. Indeed, I am sure the success of childhood vaccination in Australia is one of the reasons why the COVID-19 vaccination program has also been so successful across this country. We are, overwhelmingly, a nation of vaccinators—people who recognise the medical benefits of vaccination. Importantly, a program like No Jab, No Pay was structured to particularly motivate those who may just not have gotten around to getting a vaccination. It was, crucially, to encourage people and to make sure they were very aware of the importance of getting vaccinated and to think it through seriously if they were not going to do so. We know that program has worked and has lifted vaccination rates across Australian children once again. In doing so, it has not only protected those who have been vaccinated but, importantly, it has helped to protect even those children who have not been vaccinated, by continuing to maintain high levels of herd immunity for a number of childhood diseases.

           At present, COVID-19 vaccines are not approved for children under the age of 12, unless there are exceptional or extenuating medical circumstances. So, at present, children are not approved to receive that vaccine. The government, through the

           is one of the few countries in the world to have begun a population-wide rollout of vaccines to children. We now look forward to having the benefit of that data and evidence to inform the approvals process—the safety and the dosage rates and information—for Australian children. Once the TGA has completed its work, ATAGI will do likewise. Assuming approvals are granted, the government stands ready to both deliver and oversee the administration of COVID-19 vaccines to Australian children. We'll encourage all parents to do that once those safeguards are in place.

            Senator Rennick has claimed that vaccinating children against COVID-19 is more likely to increase risk of ill health. Does Senator Rennick's claim reflect medical advice, and, if not, will Mr Morrison publicly refute Senator Rennick's statements?

             IRMINGHAM (—) (): Vaccination can elicit concern in many. Vaccinating children can elicit even more concern, particularly in parents, and so I would urge all to be responsible in their comments and not to create unnecessary fear or concern in relation to vaccine programs at all and particularly in relation to childhood vaccination. The government, from the Prime Minister down, will make sure that when we have that advice from the TGA and ATAGI—

               that is the advice that we take to the nation. Australians should have confidence that we will act on the health expertise, medical science and best possible advice and information, and that when we recommend childhood vaccinations occur, it will be because they are safe, they are credible and they will help to fight against COVID and to protect Australia's children.
