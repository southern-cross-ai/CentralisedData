        2018 the government launched the National Forest Industries Plan—a commitment to Australia's timber industry and an investment in Australia's future. It included a commitment to plant a billion new plantation trees. Minister Littleproud said, 'Australia will have to plant a billion new trees over the next decade to meet demands in 2050, particularly sawlogs for building and construction.' Is there an implementation program for this plan? How many of the billion trees were supposed to have been planted by 30 June this year and how many have actually been planted?

         I thank the senator for his question and for the notice he gave that allowed me to get the most up-to-date advice on this topic—and I thank Senator Duniam for that advice. The forestry industry is vital. I am from a timber town, Marysville, in Victoria. The forestry industry underpins the lives and livelihoods of so many Australians. Whether it is in my own home state of Australia; the green triangle in the senator's home state of

         ; or the fantastic timber industry of Tasmania, forest products are an integral part of so many rural economies. After all, timber is the ultimate renewable resource—beautiful, natural, strong and replantable. Nothing surpasses it. It is also to the benefit of the environment in regard to carbon sequestration.

         -National government is committed to working with landholders, businesses, state and territory governments and industry to grow the forestry industry and the Australian plantation estate. Unlike those on the other side, except perhaps for Senator Ciccone, we absolutely want to grow this industry, grow the number of people it employs and grow what we believe is a renewable and sustainable industry for us that is also good for the environment. We'll always listen to their views, and that's why we partner with them. It's important that we acknowledge the issues we face. Timber supply shortages are affecting countries worldwide, and Australia is no exception—

             We were speaking about timber supply shortages. The senator mentioned how vital timber is for construction. I travel around rural and regional Australia, and timber shortages are becoming an impediment for housing construction in some of those regional communities. We're no exception; there's a worldwide shortage of timber. These issues stem from an increase in demand for timber construction—

               Minister, I'm very surprised that you don't know the answer to this. You were given notice of the question. It is only 2,800 hectares—that is, about 2.8 million trees have been planted. That is less than one per cent of the target. What's the issue? What's the plan to move ahead? Why are you not coming anywhere near the objective of this plan—a billion trees?

                It's also important to note that our forestry estates are managed by state and territory governments.

I understand from the most recent reports that, in Tasmania, the softwood estate expanded by 2,000 hectares and there is an average of 1,100 trees per hectare. That equates to an expansion of approximately 2.2 million trees. In addition, I've been advised that there are currently two contractors working on over 900 hectares of plantation, meaning that almost another million trees are going into the ground. In

                   You're right. Demand is high, supply is restrained for a whole raft of reasons, one of them being bushfires, another being logging bans in certain jurisdictions of certain areas. But, as a federal government, we'll always work with industry to help them grow, and that includes ensuring that we have as much in-country value-add as possible. That means we'll take our lead from them about what's best for the future. We want to keep timber jobs for the 52,000 Australians already employed in the sector and we want to create more jobs. When you look at export measures to prevent the export of timber, our approach is about expanding the domestic industry's home as quickly as possible in partnership with the states and with industries. You know and I know that that means helping bushfire affected sawmills upgrade and update their processing facilities through the recent $40 million bushfire program, meaning they can do more here in Australia rather than sending those raw products offshore.
