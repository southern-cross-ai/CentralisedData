        My question is to Senator Ludwig, the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        and Ageing. Can the minister confirm that the actual spend in mental health over the forward estimates is $583 million while at the same time Labor is cutting $426 million in mental health programs over the same period? Isn't this just another example of spin over substance from this Labor government?

         I do not accept the proposition that was put in that question. The government have committed $1.8 billion to regional health infrastructure through this area. The government's mental health pack­age delivers substantial new investment in mental health. We recognise mental health is a key priority and we have made room in what has, quite frankly, been a tough budget for significant new investment. We are doing this because we know that mental health is the largest single cause of disability in our community, and untreated mental illness has negative and lasting impacts on the individual, their family and the broader community.
        </p>
        <p>
         This budget includes $1.5 billion over five years in new investments as a first step towards longer-term reform. That takes the government's total new investment to $2.2 billion, which includes the elements. So that is the expenditure that we are putting in this area. But, in terms of the broader area, let us not forget Mr Abbott's mental health policy for the election was fully funded from $1.5 billion worth of cuts from the health port­folio. This includes cuts to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         services and e-health, both of which are important avenues for mental health services. And when Mr Abbott announced his most recent, $430 million, package he repeatedly refused to say how they will fund it without an unfunded promise of $430 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mental health requires long-term reform. That is why, to overcome years of underinvestment—

           Delivering better hospitals, mental health and health services

          Can the minister confirm that, despite all the hyperbole, the budget papers reveal that Labor is only providing $47.3 million in new funding for mental health in 2011-12—

           What those on the other side do not really want to come to grips with is that this government is addressing the significant issue of mental health. We have committed, as I said, $2.2 billion over the next five years, including $1.5 billion in new measures in the budget. The reforms will focus on delivering the services that have the best chance of improving the lives of thousands of Australians. I encourage those on the other side to agree that this package is a significant advancement for mental health reform in this country. It provides more intensive support services, better coordin­ating those services for people with severe illness. It targets supports to areas in comm­unities. But, most importantly, it is simply wrong to say that there is only the amount that the opposition are trying to say is in this package. Over four years it delivers—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. The government's budget press release on mental health refers to alleged reforms and init­iatives. How much of the mental health spend is new money and not simply recycled money and/or rebadged programs? In relation to the $47.3 million in new funding, doesn't that also come with a $62 million cut from existing programs? Isn't this another broken promise from Ms Gillard?

             I reject the premise of that question. If you want to look at what the opposition have done in this area, there is nothing. They injected $430 million in this area—unfunded. They would not even admit to the funding. What this government has done—and this is where the opposition do not want to hear—is significantly address the issue of mental health. They do not want to hear it. They want to reject the proposition that we are in fact acting on mental health.

               Thank you. Over four years it delivers $1.6 billion—$1 billion in new investments and $500 million from last year's investments in suicides and other areas. Over five years it delivers $2.2 billion—$1.5 billion in new investments and more than $600 million from last year's investments. Our package is partially funded from a sensible and equitable redirection of funding from the better access program. We will see what those opposite are going to do tonight.

                 I thank Senator Pratt for that question and for her interest in Indigenous employment. The Gillard government believes all Australians, regardless of their circumstances or where they live, should be able to share in the benefits of the strong economy and enjoy the financial and social benefits of work. Since 2007 we have created 750,000 jobs in Australia, and the budget shows over the next two years we will create another 500,000. It is essential that

                 share in these jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I am very pleased to inform the Senate that this year's budget contains critical measures to help Indigenous Australians get into work, including a new measure to help Indigenous students move from school into work. The Indigenous Youth Careers Path­way Program will provide $50.7 million to support up to 6,400 Indigenous students to undertake school based traineeships. School based traineeships are one of the best ways to create a pipeline of job ready, trained and motivated young Indigenous people for Australian businesses. Companies like Qantas,

                 and

                 have all benefited from taking on school based trainees, many of whom are employed with them right now. Service providers like the Aboriginal Employment Strategy have had great results in placing and retaining trainees who have gained a qualification and who are now employed. Since the

                 started its school based traineeship program in 2002, 450 Indigenous students have graduated and gone on to secure career pathways.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The critical thing for the government and for the students is that this is not training for training's sake. This is training that leads to qualifications, training that leads to employ­ment. That is where the government is now focused: on ensuring that the transition from school into employment is one that has support—

                  , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister outline to the Senate what extra support this new program will provide to help these Indigenous students to complete their school based train­eeships and move into employment? Also, how important is mentoring to achieving this?

                   One of the things we have discussed in this chamber and also in Senate estimates is the importance of education for Indigenous students, the work that is being undertaken across the country to drive up rates of literacy and numeracy but also to ensure that rates of school retention continue to rise.

                   The next challenge is helping students move from school into employment. I am happy to say that under this program organisations that deliver school based traineeships will be able to apply not just for funding to deliver the traineeships but also to provide support that is needed to help students to complete them and afterwards. One of the most critical elements of the program is that it will fund mentoring and case management for the students both in school and post school as well as in the workplace. This will ensure that the students get the personalised support, the one-on-one support they need, to overcome any barriers to finishing their traineeships and finding a job.

                     This is not the only program that the government has introduced or is funding in terms of Indigenous employment to help Indigenous youngsters. Also, $4.1 million over three years has been provided to trial the Indigenous Ranger Cadetships initiative. This is a program that has been put in place by Minister Garrett. The cadetships will give Indigenous students the opportunity to develop the skills and knowledge they need to become rangers with nationally recognised qualifications. There is also $171 million to extend a range of programs to support educational outcomes for Indigenous students.

                     has been provided to pilot culturally appro­priate mentoring services for Indig­enous job seekers. Mentoring will also be available for pre-placement support and there will be $1 million to allow greater flexibility for em­ployment service providers in remote areas to better work with Job Services.
