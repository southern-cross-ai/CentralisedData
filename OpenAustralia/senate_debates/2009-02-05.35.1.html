        Plan the Government announced yesterday - the new Energy Efficient Homes program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The program provides a $2.7 billion time-limited investment in the modernisation of Australia’s housing stock – a measure that will see almost all Australian homes insulated by the end of 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ceiling insulation is typically the most cost-effective energy improvement that can be made to homes, providing real, tangible and immediate benefits to Australian households.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An uninsulated roof cavity can lose up to 40 per cent of a building’s heat, and in many cases could deliver reductions of more than 2.5 tonnes of greenhouse gases per year for the life of the dwelling.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A typical household could also save around $200 in their energy costs each year through the installation of insulation. Despite this, up to 40 per cent of Australia’s homes do not have insulation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Energy Efficient Homes program will see ceiling insulation offered to all uninsulated owner-occupied homes over the next two and a half years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the majority of cases homeowners will not need to pay a cent — they can simply make a phone call and the Government will arrange for the installation of insulation in their roof.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is aware that those in rental properties and those who have already installed insulation in their homes will also want to play their part.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill includes enhancements to two existing energy efficiency programs: the Low Emissions Plan for Renters and the Solar Hot Water Rebate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Low Emissions Plan for Renters program provides rebates to landlords installing insulation in their rental properties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The rebate was set at up to $500 and limited to 300,000 rental homes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill provides for an increase in the maximum rebate to $1,000 until 30 June 2011 and removes the cap on the number of properties that can be insulated under this program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is an additional investment of more than $600 million and represents an unprecedented opportunity for landlords to do the right thing by their tenants and install insulation in their rental properties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill will also increase the maximum Solar Hot Water Rebate — from $1,000 to $1,600 — for households who do not access the insulation program and who replace their existing electric hot water systems with a solar and heat pump hot water system before 30 June 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household" rel="nofollow">
         Household
        </a>
        s that access this rebate could save $300 to $700 each year on their energy bills.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Energy Efficient Homes package will see an additional $3.9 billion invested in the fight against climate change and delivers on the Government’s household energy efficiency commitments in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme White Paper.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Once fully implemented these measures could reduce cumulative greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 49.4 million tonnes by 2020 – that is the equivalent of taking more than one million cars off the road.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This investment in energy efficiency will modernise Australia’s existing housing stock and contribute to meeting Australia’s 2020 target for emissions reductions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to long term environmental benefits, this package supports the jobs of tradespeople and other workers employed in the manufacturing, distribution and installation of ceiling insulation and solar and heat pump hot water systems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And there is already some early indication from business that our plan will have an impact.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let me read a quote from one insulation fitter, on ABC Radio yesterday, who said:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         “Our own company… had to lay off a shift in one of our plants just before Christmas. We’ll be putting that shift back on.”
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill also provides the enabling funding necessary to see this package implemented immediately and effectively.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This includes $50 million allocated over the forward estimates to ensure that the one-off payment for working
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Australians
        </a>
        is delivered expeditiously.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With carefully designed initiatives like those contained in this bill, there’s no reason we cannot emerge from this global recession stronger and more prosperous than we were before it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Energy Efficient Homes plan has a role to play in supporting jobs now and building the low pollution economy, and the growth and prosperity, that Australians deserve for the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the bill.

       <p class="italic">
        The unfolding global economic story reminds us daily that we find ourselves in the midst of the most significant global economic crisis since the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
         Great Depression
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Its severity has grown since the release of the Government’s $10.4 billion
        <i>
         Economic Security Strategy
        </i>
        in October last year, and has become even more serious since the
        <i>
         Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook
        </i>
        I released in November.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Projections of world growth, including by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         International Monetary Fund
        </a>
        , continue to deteriorate to a much greater extent than many envisaged at that time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The largest advanced economies in the world are already in recession, bringing the loss of millions of jobs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This global recession, the slow down in the mining sector and among our trading partners, particularly China, has serious consequences for Australian jobs and growth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While we find reassurance in knowing that Australia is better placed than almost any other developed economy to withstand this fallout, we also know we are far from immune from it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although Australia has weathered the early stages of the global recession better than many other countries, the weight of the global recession is now bearing down on the Australian economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The global mining boom that drove large increases in the terms of trade and in our national income, has come to an end.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australian growth, as a result, is expected to be significantly weaker than previously anticipated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Growth for 2008-09 has been revised down from 2 per cent in MYEFO in November to 1 per cent in UEFO, and unemployment will be higher.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And that is precisely why the Government has introduced the National Building and Jobs Plan, incorporating:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         (1)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         $28.8 billion to build the schools and roads and homes and communities and energy efficiency we need for future prosperity;
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (2)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         And $12.7 billion to boost consumption so we can support jobs now
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        Jobs now, and the building blocks of growth and prosperity for the future – that’s the absolute essence of the Nation Building and Infrastructure Plan the Prime Minister and I announced yesterday.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It’s a plan that we expect to boost growth by around ½ per cent in 2008-09, and ¾ to 1 per cent in 2009-10, and support up to 90,000 jobs over that period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is no guarantee our economy will not deteriorate further – even slower growth remains a genuine threat.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The only certainty here is that our country will be worse off, and more Australians will be out of work, if we do not act in the way I will outline today.

        The Nation Building and Jobs Plan is based on the reality that now is not the time for half measures.

        It is a time to be bold and to get on with it.

        It will allow the swift construction of the schools and roads and communities we need for future prosperity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And like the Economic Security Strategy - which boosted demand in December and January 2008 – this Plan will keep Australia ahead of the curve.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures we are introducing today are critical and they are urgent.
       </p>

        Our Plan seeks to support jobs and growth immediately, through a further round of targeted tax and transfer payments.

        It also lays foundations for higher productivity and future prosperity through a program of infrastructure investment.
       </p>

        The plan will contribute to our long-term productivity reform agenda – an agenda that embraces the education revolution, investing in advanced infrastructure,

        The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have provided clear context for the Government’s decision to further support economic growth and jobs through the Nation Building and Jobs Plan.

        Demand in the economy needs to be fostered, and our economic circumstances provide the opportunity to boost necessary economic and social infrastructure.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, our Nation Building and Jobs Plan goes beyond the roll-out of key infrastructure investment. The Government will provide $12.7 billion in tax bonuses and payments to low- and middle-income Australians as part of its Plan to help provide further immediate stimulus to the economy and to continue to support Australian households.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Widespread support will be provided to households through bonus payments under the tax and transfer system, including additional support and incentives for people to engage in education and training. These payments will complement those made in the Economic Security Strategy and seek to broaden the spending base covered in the Government’s overall response to the economic crisis. Approximately 12 million individuals will benefit from the bonus payments, which will not be taxable and will not count for income testing purposes.

        The Government is providing these cash payments to immediately support jobs and strengthen the Australian economy during a severe global recession.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With the weight of the global recession now bearing down on the Australian economy, growth is expected to be weaker than anticipated, and unemployment will be higher.
       </p>

        It will also impact directly on the budget bottom line.

        Rises in payments, also associated with the slowing economy, are contributing to net debt.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government remains committed to its medium term fiscal strategy of achieving budget surpluses, on average, over the cycle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As soon as the economy recovers, and grows above trend, the Government will take action to return the budget to surplus.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These surpluses will be drawn upon to retire debt as rapidly as economic circumstances permit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But now, in the face of a deep and protracted global recession, the government must be focused on supporting jobs and growth, while investing in nation building infrastructure – and we make no apology for that.
