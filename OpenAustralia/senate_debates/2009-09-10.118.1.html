        In taking note of this report, I note that the government were forced to table this report as a result of a motion by Senator Cormann and me. They took too long. Yes, it has now been tabled, but the government response is inadequate. In terms of the governmentâ€™s response to that report, let us just make it clear there are no action items. It is another review; it is another report with no action for and on behalf of this government. We are waiting. This government made obesity a national health priority. Prior to it being elected, they announced that that promise would be abided by and then they did it, but nothing has happened in terms of action. That is what we are concerned about. This report has a lot of very interesting recommendations in it. Now that it is out there and it has been made available to us, we will certainly consider it carefully. Of course the government have had it since 30 June, and their response is effectively a nil response to date. We will consider that and review it in due course.
