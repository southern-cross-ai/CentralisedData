         I thank Senator Murray for his contribution. As I said at the outset, it is the principle I want to address. The way it is addressed is something that we are very happy to negotiate around, so in many respects Senator Murray offers a very common-sense approach to dealing with this. I was hoping that the minister might get up and respond, and at least take a further look at this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am somewhat disappointed that Senator Trood is not in the chamber and has not contributed to this debate at all, because I know he had some very serious concerns about this matter and took this matter up for several individuals throughout the inquiry. But it seems that, when we get to the pointy end of actually doing something to address the ongoing injustice that has happened, people go missing in action, which is somewhat disappointing. However, my requests are there. The minister argues that they may be technically incorrect; I very much doubt that. The offer is there from us to work with the government to address these issues if they accept the principle, but I think the minister has clearly indicated that they do not. We will insist upon these requests.
        </p>

          Sitting suspended from 6.29 pm to 7.30 pm

         I think we have virtually exhausted the process of trying to convince the government to concede to these requests. The minister has indicated that they will not but, now that he has had the opportunity to have a comfortable and relaxed dinner, maybe he has had time to contemplate these serious issues and has changed his mind. It is nice to see Senator Joyce in the chamber, because, from what I understand, he has indicated his support to a number of people who have been disadvantaged by the government’s actions over the last decade and may be here to assist me by offering support for these amendments. I had hoped that Senator Trood would also appear after the dinner break. Anyway, the government now have the opportunity. As I finished saying before the dinner break, we will insist upon these requests.

         Question put:
        </p>
        <p class="moved">
         That the requests (
         <b>
          Senator Marshall’s
         </b>
         ) be agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bill, as amended, agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.
