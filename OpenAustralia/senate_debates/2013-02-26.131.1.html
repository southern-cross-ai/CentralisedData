        I rise this evening to pay tribute to Giulia Bonacina

        , who passed away last month at the age of 93 years. As was mentioned in an interview with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        journalist a couple of years ago, speak to just about anyone in Wollongong and they will recognise the name of Giulia Bonacina. Giulia was born in Treviso, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Italy" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Italy
        </a>
        , on 22 April 1920. In this same interview, which I had the pleasure of listening to again this evening, she recounted how she and her husband Efram had married in Italy and talked about his work in the immigration area. After they left Italy, they went to Argentina and then returned to Italy before coming to Australia as assisted migrants. They first went to Bulahdelah and then eventually to Wollongong, where they made their home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bonacinas brought their three children to Australia when they came in 1961 and later had their fourth child, a son, in Wollongong. Having been born and raised in Wollongong, I have known the Bonacinas from a young age. They like my parents were migrants, arriving in Australia in 1961 in search of a better life. And like my parents and so many others they went on to make the most of their Australian life. They were married for 60 years and renewed their vows not once or twice but three times, the last occasion of which took place at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Sacred Heart Church
        </a>
        in Wollongong. This was a testimony to the love and commitment they had for each other. Both Giulia and Efram specifically sought no gifts to mark their anniversary, and requested instead that a donation be made to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wollongong" rel="nofollow">
         University of Wollongong
        </a>
        foundation in support of cataract research. This wonderful gesture epitomised the special qualities of this couple. They were indeed a very dynamic duo.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the early years after arriving in Australia, they spent 11 months apart whilst Efram was sent to hostels in Wollongong and Giulia was sent to Skyville Migrant Hostel in Windsor, where she had her first experience as a translator. Efram commenced work at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
         BHP
        </a>
        and the family was reunited. During this time, Giulia devoted herself to the family and begun work in the Good Neighbour Council, helping new residents from all nationalities assimilate in Australia. She also continued her work as a translator by providing her services to the Children's Court in Wollongong. She assisted with both the Italian and Spanish language. Her experience from the Good Neighbour Council led her to become a founding committee member of Co.As.It in the region. Co.As.It was an Italian social welfare organisation that specialised in helping Italians who had recently arrived in Australia to establish themselves by finding housing and, for those in need, parcels of food and clothing. Co.As.It provided core services and support for the Italian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Co.As.It closed in Wollongong, Giulia and her husband continued their charitable work by establishing ItSoWel, which to this day still plays an important role in cultivating activities, services and education for the Australian-Italian community in the Illawarra. Their mission statement for the foundation was to 'deliver an array of culturally and linguistically appropriate services that empowered the community to increase their quality of life, and the promotion of the Italian culture, language and heritage'. Over the years, ItSoWel has provided a wide range of services in a range of different areas such as ageing and aged care, dementia, mental health, disabilities, community integration, social service supports, and Italian language and cooking courses, and raised funds for students to study in Italy. Above all, they rendered very important overseas pension assistance. They helped many Australians of Italian origin to rightfully claim their entitlement to an Italian pension. ItSoWel is a tribute to Giulia and Efram and I trust its board will continue to grow, nurture and foster the organisation with each generation in the same spirit of dedicated service of its founders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Giulia's dedication to the Illawarra community did not only focus on ItSoWel. Giulia exemplified a strong volunteer ethos and her outstanding dedication extended to other community areas. She organised the University of Wollongong's Friends of the University and later on, in 1990, became a fellow. Both she and Efram were foundation members of the Friends of the University and both received fellowships in 1991â€”the first husband and wife team to be admitted as fellows. In 2000, Giulia was chosen to be a torch bearer for the 2000 Olympics, an honour that very few have a chance to participate in. In the same year she was awarded the Queen's Australian Sports Medal for her participation and leadership in bocce, the Italian version of bowls. In 2002 she was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her service to the Italian community in the Wollongong area through a range of social welfare, cultural, women's and senior citizen organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, Efram died in December 2005 after a short illness. Giulia continued on with her tireless activities. In 2012, she was awarded the 2012 United Nations Older Person Award for Wollongong for her commitment and dedication to the older members in the Wollongong community. She had also been awarded the Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, as well as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         British Empire Medal
        </a>
        in 1980. In 1987 she had been knighted by the Italian government, receiving the Croce di Cavaliere. Fundraising for those in need was the highlight in the Bonacinas' life and they focused their charity work on bushfire victims, the Kidney Foundation, the Cancer Council and Leukemia for Kids, as well as sending money to disaster areas in Italy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Giulia worked hard to uphold the legacy of migrant history for future generations and was quoted saying: 'I like to leave the future generations knowledge of how our life was as migrants. I believe everyone has an experience to teach the newcomers.' It was this passion that led Giulia to join the Migrant Heritage Project to see that this legacy would continue and her stories were told.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Illawarra has lost great Australian. Her legacy remains, with strong foundations and purpose towards community social work. Giulia Bonacina was recognised both locally and internationally. This is a testament to her inspirational work and service. She was a pioneer who showcased in a practical and selfless way the very best attributes of our migrant narrative. She noted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Every migrant's experience is different and every migrant brings with them their own different experience and culture. Our culture plus other cultures can only make an even better culture and this is important and this should never be forgotten.
       </p>
       <p>
        I last saw Giulia when she attended Christmas drinks in my office a few months ago, accompanied by her daughter Marzia. True to form, she took me aside and said she wanted to raise with me an issue about assistance for the aged and asked if she could come and see me immediately after Christmas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Giulia is survived by her three children, 11 grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren and two great-great-granddaughters. I know I speak on behalf of the Australian-Italian community, who will remember all the things she did and all the people she helped.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a personal note, on behalf of all my familyâ€”especially my parents, Antonia and Giuseppe, who knew the Bonacinas wellâ€”I acknowledge the support and the friendship that you gave me and them over many years. May you rest in peace. Vale Giulia Bonacina.
