         Thank you, Senator Cameron. Today I had the great pleasure of joining the Prime Minister, Premier Baird and Premier Andrews for the signing of the intergovernmental agreements between
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Victoria for the full rollout of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         through Victoria and through New South Wales. These agreements will see more than half of the eligible NDIS population nationwide covered by the scheme. It is important to emphasise at this point that I am working hard on concluding agreements with the other jurisdictions in relation to the NDIS in the other states and territories. This agreement delivers on the heads of agreement that was signed by the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments to implement the full scheme across New South Wales by July 2018 and in Victoria to implement the full scheme across that state by July 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to emphasise that the NDIS is the core business of government, helping people who face extra challenges for reasons beyond their control.

           I will, if the opposition will be silent for a moment. The agreements signed today mean that from July next year the full state-wide rollout in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           and Victoria will commence. The agreement gives certainty to around 140,000 people with disabilities and their families, who will receive support through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           in New South Wales. By the end of the two-year rollout, the full NDIS will be operating across New South Wales and around 115,000 participants will have the services and supports that they need. The agreement also provides for up to 26,000 potential new entrants in the year after the transition period—people who have newly acquired disabilities do not have a current need or who are currently unknown to the disability support system. It means that the full NDIS will be operating across New South Wales by 2018 and, in time, around 140,000 participants will have what they need. Victoria—good news as well: 105,000 people across that state.

              NDIS

             , despite what came from the other side in the answer to the first question, the NDIS is an example of this parliament working at its best. The NDIS is an example of Commonwealth-state relations at their best. This is the Australian parliaments and the Australian governments lifting themselves beyond partisanship to make sure that Australians with disability get the better deal that they deserve.
