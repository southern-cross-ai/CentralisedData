         I thank Senator Waters for that question. Firstly, Adani Mining's announcement of 29 November that it will fully fund its Carmichael mine and rail infrastructure project ends the uncertainty on financing for this project. The project is subject to over 180 environmental conditions from Commonwealth and state regulators. The conditions fully implement the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development advice. The government is committed to ensuring that important projects such as this progress in a way which also protects the environment. Expert advice is being sought from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Geoscience Australia
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         on Adani's groundwater plans, to ensure that water sources are properly protected. Adani's North Galilee's water scheme is being assessed under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC
         </a>
         Act for significant impacts on listed threatened species and ecological communities. The scheme includes a dam and pipeline and will use an existing surface water licence from Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         Directly to the question, an assessment of the project is now being undertaken before a decision is made about whether the proposal can proceed under national environmental law. There will be an opportunity for public comment during the assessment of the project. The government is applying the law to this project just like it would to any other project. Labor, of course, has done nothing in relation to this but play politics with this mine, whether that's saying they oppose it to win inner city seats or saying they support it when they're campaigning in Queensland, and the Greens of course are no better. Unlike the Labor opposition and the Greens, the coalition is not going to play politics with this project. We have been clear that we support developments like this mine, subject to appropriate environmental approvals.

           Minister, is it also true—and thanks for clarifying that you could stop Adani but you're choosing not to—that your government could also stop Adani's mine going ahead by not ticking off on their groundwater management plan, given that 58 per cent of Queensland is in drought? If so, why won't you do this?

            We make decisions based on science and objective evidence, not politics. We have a responsibility to follow proper process and we will continue to follow proper process in relation to this important project. I can also advise the Senate that Adani still needs to provide further information in relation to aspects of the plans before they can be approved and, as I've already indicated, expert advice is being sought from

               We support projects like this. We support developments like this, subject to appropriate environmental approvals. Those approvals of course have to be obtained through proper processes—not based on discretionary political decisions. That is the process that we will continue to follow.
