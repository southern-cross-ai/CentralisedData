        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. Will the minister inform the Senate whether compulsory powers that apply to the former Australian Building and Construction Commission, and which currently apply to Labor's own Fair Work Building and Construction commission, which will expire in two months, are necessary and unique.

           I was just conferring with the Clerk on exactly the same matter. It is on the

           . Thank you, Senator Moore, for raising that. It is important that we clarify these matters. The rule is that the minister can address that matter providing he does not anticipate debate in relation to the bill that is on the

            Notice Paper
           </i>
           . I will be listening to the minister's answer. At this stage he has not gone long enough for me to make that determination.

            It terms of anticipating what could be in the debate, is it content or argument? I am not sure how that operates. You are saying that it cannot cover things that are part of the debate; I just want to see what can be discussed in this particular answer.

             I will seek some further advice from the Clerk in a moment but if 'anticipating debate' related to the general content there would be no discussion. I will just confer with the Clerk. Just one moment, Senator Moore.
            </p>
            <p>
             'Anticipating the debate' is about all clauses of the bill, but the issues surrounding the bill can be discussed and canvassed—the actual issues of the clauses. I will be listening. I think the minister has enough experience to be able to weave his way through this.

                 There has been general, broad community debate about these matters, and the assertion that only construction workers are subject to these powers in relation to the former commission and the existing Fair Work Building and Construction is false, because they apply to all managers, contractors and workers alike. The
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                  ACCC
                 </a>
                 chair has said that it was only by using compulsory powers that it was able to continue its case against the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
                  CFMEU

                 , and that was in enforcing consumer and competition laws.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Even Labor's own review of the previous

                  ABCC
                 </a>
                 concluded that it would 'not be a responsible course to recommend removing compulsory powers'. In short, these powers are essential to confronting the blatant contempt for the rule of law displayed on construction sites. It is interesting to observe that the Labor Party believes that there should be harsher investigative powers for a potential welfare cheat under Centrelink legislation than those that would engage in corruption on construction sites.

                    I probably do not need a point of order on this, Senator Moore. The question is now referring to provisions of the bill.

                    Order! We are in very difficult territory, because the standing orders do provide that debate cannot be anticipated. I interpreted from the question that that would infringe the standing orders. I invite the questioner, Senator Ruston, to ask the question again—probably in broader terms.

                      I thank Senator Ruston for the question. There is overwhelming evidence that the

                      </a>
                      does not respect the rule of law. The CFMEU's Shaun Riordan has been seen filming workers who chose to return to work during a union strike—the same man who allegedly threatened to stab a security guard in the neck during an industrial dispute. Why are these threats and records necessary—to enhance work place safety or to intimidate those who might speak out against their thuggish agenda?

                      Fair Work Building and Construction Director Nigel Hadgkiss told the Senate estimates just last week that the only way his organisation can get intimidated victims of unlawful conduct to tell their story is through the use of compulsory powers. Australia has a choice as to whether or not it seeks to condone this sort of behaviour or to stand against it.

                        say if there were 72 company directors or 72 bankers currently before the law for breach of their statutory duties and requirements? What would Labor say? They would say there is a crisis. They would say that this behaviour is endemic. They would say special laws were needed. And I would agree with them. That is why I invite them to seriously consider the matters that are, in fact, before the Senate.
