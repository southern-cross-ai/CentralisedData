        PRIMARY INDUSTRIES (EXCISE) LEVIES AMENDMENT (DAIRY PRODUCE) BILL 2014
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Changes to primary industries levies are brought into effect by government in response to a request from a relevant peak industry representative body. The
        <i>
         Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999
        </i>
        provides maximum amounts or ‘caps’ for each specified levy.

        The purpose of the bill is to increase the Australian Animal Health

       <p class="italic">
        Council (AAHC) levy caps for milk fat and protein to provide a higher ceiling for the levy rates, to allow Australian Dairy Farmers to increase the levies in the future if required. The increase to the caps will not increase the current operative rate of the levies. Should Australian Dairy Farmers consider it necessary to increase the operative rates in future, it will be required to demonstrate widespread industry consultation and majority support—as outlined in the

       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the case of the AAHC levy for the dairy industry the current operative levy rates for milk fat and protein are set at the maximum levels. These caps were last set in 1999. Without these cap increases, a risk exists that Australian Dairy Farmers, the peak industry representative body for the dairy industry, will not be able to provide increased funding to AAHC by subscription fees for animal health and welfare initiatives. AAHC subscription fees provide funding for core Animal Health Australia programs to benefit the dairy industry. This amendment was first requested by industry in early 2012 and has been delayed.

           On 2 December 2013, the committee gave notice to disallow two instruments whilst it sought further information on the incorporation of extrinsic material in the two instruments. The committee has received a satisfactory response to its concerns from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The committee's concluding remarks are documented in Delegated Legislation Monitor No. 2 of 2014. Accordingly, the committee seeks to withdraw the notice of motion to disallow the two instruments.
