           The Morrison government is committed to establishing a Commonwealth integrity commission to enhance accountability across the public sector. Exposure draft legislation was ready for release, to allow for consultation ahead of its introduction into parliament, before the global economic and health crises caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Obviously, in recent months the government's focus has been to keep Australians safe and provide the support needed to help businesses and to protect jobs. The Greens' National Integrity Commission Bill 2018 (No. 2) has fundamental flaws that could result in wasteful duplication and individual injustices. The bill was not supported by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee when it considered the bill in April last year. The government remains committed to establishing the

           and will progress with the next steps of the release of draft legislation at an appropriate time, after more immediate priorities concerning to management of the COVID recovery have been dealt with.
