        MP
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am pleased to present the Australian Government’s response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee’s report Quality and equity in aged care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The matters raised in the report are wide-ranging.

 Our overwhelmingly positive response to the report reflects the fact that most of the matters raised were under consideration by Government.

 Action has been taken consistent with our commitment to maintain Australia’s high quality and world class aged care system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Overall, since the 2004-05 Budget the Australian Government has committed close to $2.1 billion in new initiatives that address the issues identified in the recommendations made by the Committee.

 This is in addition to the announcements made in the 2004-05 Budget including the $2.2 billion package of reforms in response to the Review of Pricing Arrangements in Residential Aged Care (the Hogan Review).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This year’s Budget continues the Australian Government’s strong commitment to supporting older Australians.

 It contains more than $1.7 billion for further improvements to our aged care system. This includes an extensive package of reforms, called Securing the future of aged care for Australians which was announced by the Prime Minister in February 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our record of unprecedented investment in aged care clearly demonstrates the Government’s commitment to provide for the best of care for Australians as they age.

 Total Australian Government expenditure on ageing and aged care activities will have grown from some $3.1 billion in 1995-96 to an estimated $10 billion in 2010-11—more than a three-fold increase.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The number of Australian Government subsidised aged care places also continues to increase.

 At 30 June 2006, there were 204,869 operational aged care places.

 This number exceeds the election commitment we made in 2001 to provide 200,000 operational aged care places by June 2006.

 In February 2007 we announced that we will lift the overall provision ratio to 113 places for every 1,000 people aged 70 years or over, including an increase in community care places from 20 to 25.

 This will yield 250,000 places by June 2011 of which 100,000 will have been added by the Australian Government since 1996.

        INTRODUCTION
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 23 June 2004, the Senate referred the following matters to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee (‘the Committee’) for inquiry and report by 30 September 2004:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         (a)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         the adequacy of current proposals, including those in the 2004 Budget, in overcoming aged care workforce shortages and training;
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (b)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         the performance and effectiveness of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency in:
         <dl>
          <dt>
           (i)
          </dt>
          <dd>
           assessing and monitoring care, health and safety,
          </dd>
          <dt>
           (ii)
          </dt>
          <dd>
           identifying best practice and providing information, education and training to aged care facilities, and
          </dd>
          <dt>
           (iii)
          </dt>
          <dd>
           implementing and monitoring accreditation in a manner which reduces the administrative and paperwork demands on staff;
          </dd>
         </dl>
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (c)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         the appropriateness of young people with disabilities being accommodated
 in residential aged care facilities and the extent to which residents with special needs, such as dementia, mental illness or specific conditions are met under current funding arrangements;
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (d)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         the adequacy of Home and Community Care programmes in meeting the current and projected needs of the elderly; and
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (e)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         the effectiveness of current arrangements for the transition of the elderly from acute hospital settings to aged care settings or back to the community.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        On 1 December 2004 the Senate agreed to the Committee’s recommendation that the reference, not disposed of at the end of the 40th Parliament, be re-adopted with a reporting date of 23 June 2005.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        received 243 public submissions and 10 confidential submissions.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">
         The Inquiry
        </a>
        also drew extensively on evidence and analysis published in the Review of Pricing Arrangements in Residential Aged Care,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Report" rel="nofollow">
         Final Report
        </a>
        (‘the Hogan Review’).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee’s report, entitled Quality and equity in aged care, was tabled and released on the 23 June 2005.

 The report included 51 recommendations.

 In the majority of cases the recommendations focused on matters which the Australian Government was considering or on which action was being taken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government’s response to the Review of Pricing Arrangements in Residential Aged Care in the 2004-05 Budget provided a $2.2 billion package, Investing in Australia’s Aged Care: More Places, Better Care.

 The large majority of the reforms included in this package, many of which address issues identified by the Inquiry, are now in place.

 The outstanding matters have required complex and rigorous development and testing over time including the new funding model and related information technology systems.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has announced that the new Aged Care Funding Instrument (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACFI" rel="nofollow">
         ACFI
        </a>
        ), which has been developed with extensive involvement of many residential care providers, will be in place on 20 March 2008.

 The ACFI will be supported by the implementation of eBusiness and an updated payments system for aged care subsidies which are being developed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medicare Australia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Beginning with the enactment of the Aged Care Act 1997, the Australian Government has pursued a reform agenda to ensure that older Australians can access a world class, high quality and affordable aged care system that is responsive to their needs and preferences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the $2.2 billion package in the 2004-05 Budget the Australian Government has continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of the aged care system.

 Where necessary, new reforms have been introduced and reforms in progress built on through strengthened arrangements or additional funding.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This year’s Budget continues the Australian Government’s strong commitment to supporting older Australians.

 It contains more than $1.7 billion in new funding for further improvements to our aged care system. This includes an extensive package of reforms, called Securing the future of aged care for Australians which was announced by the Prime Minister in February 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The package allocates $1.1 billion to increase Government payments for residents of aged care homes including an additional $92.2 million in the Budget taking the total funding in the package to $1.6 billion.

 Of this funding, $884 million will support initiatives related to matters identified by the Inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, funding for new aged care initiatives in the Budget totals a further $255.4 million. Overall, including resident contributions, funding for residential care will increase by $1.3 billion over the next four years, on top of increases for indexation and the increased places already factored into Budget estimates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Overall, since the 2004-05 Budget the Australian Government has committed close to

 $2.1 billion in new initiatives that address the issues identified in the recommendations made by the Committee.

 In relation to a number of the new initiatives funding has been augmented by additional resources from the states and territories through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        or other avenues.

 Details of the initiatives are provided in the responses to the recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consequently, the Government considers that the large majority of the recommendations made by the Committee are being addressed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not agree with four recommendations.

 Each of these is inconsistent with current whole-of-government policies on such matters as workplace relations and programme indexation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government’s responses to the recommendations made by the Committee are set out below.

 They clearly demonstrate the Government’s willingness to invest in reform and the development of care for older Australians.

         The Committee welcomes the Commonwealth’s allocation of 400 extra nursing places at universities in the 2004-05 Budget.
        </i>
        <i>
        </i>
        <i>
         However, the Committee recommends that the Commonwealth further increase the number of undergraduate nursing places at Australian universities to 1000 as recommended by the Hogan Review.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to the 440 aged care nursing places funded in the 2004-05 Budget and Additional Estimates, a further 1,036 general nursing places have been allocated to universities across Australia in 2006 for commencement in 2007. Universities are able to bid for new places for aged care nursing.

 Aged care nursing is regularly identified by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Employment_and_Workplace_Relations" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Employment and Workplace Relations
        </a>
        and state and territory health ministers as a skill in demand which informs the allocation of new places.

 Universities are also able to redistribute places from general nursing or other disciplines toward aged care nursing to meet student and employer demand.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Funding of $4.1 million for up to 410 more post-graduate nursing scholarships over four years was committed by the Australian Government in its final response to Hogan Review announced on 11 February 2007.

 The scholarships are part of a $32 million package of support designed to encourage more and better qualified people to work in community care and complement the Aged Care Nursing Scholarship Program which provides up to 250 scholarships each year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding to assist nursing clinical training has increased this year from around $690 to $1,045 per nursing unit of study (2007 prices) to enable eligible higher education providers to expand and improve their clinical training arrangements.

 In addition, as part of the 2007-08 Budget, funding for nursing units of study will increase by an additional 1 per cent from 2008.

 These initiatives will enable higher education providers to expand and improve their nurse teaching and clinical training arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 2007-08 Budget also provided $211 million over four years to increase university flexibility. A part of this measure was a relaxation on the caps on university places (both Commonwealth supported and full fee) which may lead to further increases in the number of nursing places offered at universities across the country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         <i>
          Recommendation 2
         </i>
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         That the Commonwealth work with aged care providers to ensure that their shared responsibility to assist enrolled nurses to complete medication management training meets the target as recommended by the Hogan Review.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has responded to Professor Hogan’s recommendations by supporting the full cost of 5,250 additional certificates of attainment in medication management over four years from 2004-05.

 Providers are expected to share responsibility in ensuring more enrolled nurses complete medication management training.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         <i>
          Recommendation 3

        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         That the Commonwealth implement a strategy which allocates an appropriate number of undergraduate nursing places on the basis that recruitment for those places occurs from the current residential and community care workforce in both rural and urban settings proportionally.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For all universities receiving the new aged care nursing places that commenced in 2005, a clause has been included in their Commonwealth Grant Scheme Funding Agreement which requires the aged care places to be allocated with a preference for applicants with experience working in the aged care industry and that the course must respond to the needs of students who continue to work in the aged care industry.

 Of the 440 extra places allocated to aged care nursing from 2005, 195 were allocated to campuses in the capital cities and 245 to regional campuses.
       </p>

       </p>

        The Australian Government provides a viability supplement for small residential aged care facilities and those in rural and remote locations in recognition of the difficulties faced by such services in attracting and retaining staff.

 In the 2004-05 Budget, the Government increased this viability supplement by $14.8 million over 4 years.

 In the 2006-07 Budget, $19.4 million over 4 years was provided to extend a viability supplement to providers of Community Aged Care Packages, Extended Aged Care at Home (EACH) and EACH Dementia programmes.

           That the Senate take note of the response.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government statement tabled today is in response to a report which was tabled in this place on 23 June 2005. It has taken this government two years and three months to respond to a report that you would expect the Senate to receive within three months. It is normal to expect a government response three months after the tabling of a report, but we have had to wait two years and three months to receive this document.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was very pleased to be the chair of that inquiry into aged care by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. I acknowledge Senator Allison’s involvement in developing the terms of reference, particularly on the issues affecting young people in nursing homes. To take two years and three months to respond to what was an excellent but not huge report is appalling. This government document is one of hollow self-congratulation. It intentionally misunderstands some of the recommendations.
          </p>
          <p>
           The report was divided into a range of areas. Time will not allow me to deal with all of them but, hopefully, I will get to the most important ones. Almost three years ago, when I became the shadow minister for ageing, the big issue people would talk to me about when I went to aged-care facilities was funding, particularly capital raising. The most significant issue now facing aged care, both residential and community—and this government knows it—is attracting and retaining a quality workforce to care for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.
          </p>
          <p>
           The response from the government to the seven recommendations that the committee made in our report is, to be frank, ridiculous. The first recommendation that our committee made was to do with the number of nurses that we have in aged care—in particular, residential aged care. In the life of this government, the number of registered and enrolled nurses who now work in our aged-care facilities in Australia has reduced. At the same time, the number of people who live in residential aged care in Australia has increased by almost 25,000. So we have fewer qualified nurses caring for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.
          </p>
          <p>
           The recommendation of our committee was to follow the recommendation of Professor Warren Hogan, which was to increase the number of undergraduate nursing places at Australian universities to 1,000. The response is offensive. It talks about the 440 aged-care nurses funded in the 2004-05 budget. That is acknowledged in the recommendation. The response then goes on to talk about the normal number of undergraduate places that are there every year—year in, year out. The recommendation was clear. We want an extra thousand at least to deal with the problem that we have in finding nurses to work right across the health sector but particularly in aged care.

           In 2004 this government received a report that said that we are 19,000 nurses short in this country. I note, though, that the government in its response was too embarrassed to talk about the 500 enrolled nurses who, the Prime Minister announced last week, are now going to be trained in hospitals rather than in the well-organised and well-run

           system. We know, and Catholic Health Australia knows, that those 500 enrolled nurses that the government has promised to be trained in TAFE will never end up in aged care, because the pathway is not there. I commend

           from Catholic Health Australia for raising the issue, as did I, because we know that that announcement will not result in any new nurses, either enrolled or full nurses, who work in aged care.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommendation" rel="nofollow">
            Recommendation
           </a>
           5 of the committee report said that as, a matter of priority, we need to expand the National Aged Care Workforce Strategy to encompass the full aged-care workforce, including medical and allied health professionals across all of the aged-care sector, including the community care sector. There is a little bit of honesty in the response to this recommendation. The government acknowledge that further work needs to occur to cover the full aged-care workforce. What have they been doing?
          </p>
          <p>
           We have known of the problem of workforce in aged care, but the government are still acknowledging that we need to do further work. The next paragraph of the response does tell you what has been happening: they have taken a census. They have counted the number of people who are working in aged care. I am sorry, but we actually need more than counting people who work in aged care. We would like to know how we are going to train, pay and therefore keep people in aged-care services so that we can actually run the facilities that we have.

           The second section that the report goes to is a section on accreditation. The first recommendation talks about the need for delivering consistency in assessment of aged-care facilities. The second recommendation goes to the question of the accuracy of assessors’ decisions and, further, is about the access to the process of accreditation by both residents and their families. Once again, the government has intentionally misunderstood the first two recommendations. The issues have not been addressed by this government. Every time there is a problem in aged care and an issue is raised, particularly in the media, the question of consistency of assessment is raised.
          </p>
          <p>
           We need to have confidence as a community in a system that delivers a fair analysis of the quality of care that is being provided. It is my clear and strong view that we have in fact eroded that confidence in the accreditation process in aged care, particularly over the last 18 months. Aged-care providers have no confidence in the assessment system. The more they find out about it, the more families have limited confidence in the process of accreditation and quality assurance. Unfortunately, we are now getting to the point where I do not think parliamentarians have confidence in the process either. When we lose confidence in the process, I am afraid it is time for a review.

           Also in that section, the committee recommended that the agency develop a ratings system that would allow residents and families to make informed comparisons between different aged-care facilities. This followed on from a recommendation of Professor Hogan, who recommended that there be a star rating so that people could make some decision about the facility before either entering it themselves or placing a loved one there. Personally, I do not agree with Professor Hogan’s star rating. It is not a motel that we are talking about. We are talking about a place where a person is going to live and receive care.

           Once again, the government intentionally misunderstood the recommendation. The recommendation says that we want to give people information so they can make an informed judgement on where they might want to go. The government then went to great lengths to talk about how they have developed a website. And the website is quite good. Whoever developed it did a quite good job. But it does not allow you to make any comparison about the quality of care that is being provided at the facility—the level of staffing. It does not tell you what charges will be levelled on any resident. It does tell you where it is, and that is useful. We acknowledge that; that is okay. But, once again intentionally, the government has not addressed the guts of the question.
