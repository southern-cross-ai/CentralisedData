        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Prior to the election, Prime Minister Albanese said to all Australians, 'I'll say this very clearly, they will be better off under a Labor government.' He promised that a Labor government will see electricity prices fall from the current levels by $275 for households by 2025. But isn't it true that, according to your own budget, this December Aussies will have to pay 50 per cent more just to run the aircon, pump the pool and turn on the Christmas lights?

           It is the case that Australians are battling higher energy prices, and we know why that is: we know what we inherited and we know where global markets are.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think you perfected the art of 'I don't hold a hose, mate.' I'll take the interjection from Senator Ruston—she says you don't take responsibility. We've got your people in the House voting against the censure motion for the former Prime Minister who made an artform of never taking responsibility for everything! So let's be clear about who has been prepared to be upfront with the Australian people, who are clear that we have a significant problem in our energy markets that the government is working through, which is as a consequence of nearly a decade of inaction and denial of 22 failed energy policies and what is occurring globally. I know those opposite don't want to be reminded of this, but the reality is renewables are the cheapest form of power.

           You see? If you ever wanted an example of why energy markets are where they are, it's because you are still locked into an ideological battle, a vortex of an inaction, because of the fight between the Gerard Rennicks and the Andrew Braggs.

               I'm actually happy to take Senator Rennick's interjections, because I think what it demonstrates—and so does the result in Victoria and the result of all those seats which were traditional Liberal heartland seats—is that your ideological fight internally has put you out of touch with the market and where most Australians are. That is the hard reality.

                 In coming weeks Australians will be heading back to home to their families and then off to a well-deserved break. Some will be at the beach or some will head to the regions. Isn't it true that they'll be paying more than their plane tickets, more for their bus tickets and then more for their snacks at the servo and your government has no plans to fix it?

We've overhauled the gas trigger to allow it to be activated quarterly if there is a shortfall and force exporters to divert supply for domestic markets. These are all things you did not do. We are working with the ACCC to strengthen the code of conduct between gas suppliers and customers to get reasonable prices in the market. We know there is more to do, but unlike you we are not engaged in an internal ideological fight between people like you, who might have a rational position, and Senator Rennick, who continues to argue a position that reminds me of

                        Very soon, Australians will be gathered around the table for Christmas lunch. They will not be better off. They will have paid more for the turkey, more for the ham, more for the bonbons, more for the beers—or possibly the prosecco—and more to get presents for the kids. Is this what the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations meant when he said, 'People will be seeing in their bank accounts what a change in government means'?
