        My question without notice is to the senator representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer the senator to a letter to the Joint Commonwealth and Tasmanian Economic Council on behalf of 330 employees at the Boyer Paper Mill and the other 900 Tasmanians who rely directly on the mill's survival.
       </p>
       <p>
        The letter notes, 'A significant cost disadvantage associated with shipping across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Strait
        </a>
        has been known to the government for many years. But, with respect, the required reforms have yet to be implemented and an immediate solution is required in relation to international export costs if businesses in Tasmania are to survive.' When did the senator become aware of the letter, and does he agree that the 330 employees jobs at the Boyer Paper Mill and the other 900 Tasmanian jobs that are at risk if an immediate solution to international export costs from Tasmania is not found?

         In my 21 years in the Senate, I have been a very regular visitor to the Boyer mill, engaging with the staff, the management and the workforce. I believe I understand the issues.

             You can shake your head; you can deny the obvious and you can deny the fact but, I am sorry, that is what the

              Productivity Commission

             said. We can deny that which the Productivity Commission said, but that is the biggest issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem that Boyer faces is this: to get a roll of newsprint all the way from
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
              New Zealand
             </a>
             to Melbourne costs so much less than getting it across

              Bass Strait
             </a>
             . The reason for that is the unduly high cost of coastal shipping around Australia, courtesy of the changes made by the Labor-Green majority in the Senate just a few years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             Am I aware of the problems of Bass Strait and the cost impediment it is to jobs, to Tasmanians? I have been aware of that for 21 years in this place and for many years before that, because the Liberal Party has a very proud tradition—

                   Does he agree that there are 900 jobs at risk here if an immediate solution is not found? I just want a simple yes or no. Do you understand that? That is all I am asking.

That is why we as a government are working very methodically through the Productivity Commission review's recommendations to ascertain what we can do to ensure that we can protect as many jobs as possible and indeed grow job opportunities in our home state of Tasmania.

                         Compared to what was on offer under the previous state Labor government, clearly that which the Hodgman government is seeking to deliver is a lot better than what was in place before—namely, nothing. So we do not deal with these things in a vacuum. In relation to the federal component, as I said, we are looking into this. It is a matter of concern.
