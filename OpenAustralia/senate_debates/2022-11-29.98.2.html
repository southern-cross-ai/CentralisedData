        My question is to Senator Wong, representing the climate minister. Minister, another
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">
         UNESCO
        </a>
        scientific report has recommended that the

        be put on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">

        in danger list because its outstanding universal values are threatened by climate change. In responding to the report this morning, the environment minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Plibersek" rel="nofollow">
         Tanya Plibersek
        </a>
        , publicly acknowledged that we need to keep warming below 1.5 degrees to save the Great Barrier Reef. Minister, your government's legislated 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030 is consistent with two degrees of global warming, and the science tells us that this is a death sentence for the reef as we have known it. Millions of Australians who love the reef won't be fooled by this apparent cognitive dissonance. Minister, what is it going to be: a climate plan that limits global warming to 1.5 degrees, and gives the reef a chance, or to two degrees and a death sentence to the reef as we have been lucky enough to have known it in our lifetimes?

         This government was elected with a plan to take strong action on climate, and that is what we will do. This party, over many years—over a decade—has had a very clear, ambitious and strong position on climate. And we have not just talked about it; we won government and we delivered action on climate. Regrettably, we lost government and it has been a number of years, nearly 10 years, not only of inaction but of denial and delay and dysfunction on that side of the parliament, and Australia is the poorer for it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked about the 43 per cent target: we were clear with the Australian people before the election, and I would make the point that that is consistent with the net-zero-by-2050 position that we have also been committed to. It is the case—and I'll make two points about the

           : firstly, obviously, climate is a risk to all our natural environment. We know that. We've been told that, and that is why we need to take the action we are taking and that is why we need to work as we did at the previous Conference of the Parties—

          <p>
           I know that those opposite don't like to hear this. We need to work like Minister Bowen did at the Conference of the Parties to ensure that there is no backsliding on the Glasgow commitments, and that we maintain the ambitious position and continue to build on the position that was agreed in Glasgow.
          </p>
          <p>
           We also have a lot of work to do in our domestic economy, and the government is committed to doing so.

              I don't accept the premise at the end of that question, which suggests that a government that is willing to work with the Australian people to shift this economy from being one of the most emissions-intensive economies in the world to a 43 per cent reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050—the thing about the Greens is they think you can say a target and it will be delivered. You see, we actually understand there are workers and industries and communities and people who have to be part of this journey. We all have to change.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I've said previously, I am grateful that the Australian people have elected a parliament and a government that is willing to act on climate—and we will. No amount of coming in here and asking questions like that, which suggest that we also don't care, will detract from the fact that we are serious about taking action, and we will.
