        They say that it takes a village to raise a child, and, sadly, my village lost one of its greats recently. After a lengthy battle with dementia, Richard Hoogewerf, surrounded by his loving family, peacefully passed away. During our teenage years, Richard left a profound impression on me and several of my friends. I seek to pay tribute to him today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Richard and his wife, Margaret, are a terrific Australian migrant success story. Together with their two young boys, the Hoogewerf migrated to Australia from Durban,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">

        , in the early eighties. Seeing the ever-increasing violence and turmoil in their home country, they longed for a safer and more prosperous life for their family. While Australia gave them that opportunity, the Hoogewerf's paid back Australia's offerings in spades. At Richard's funeral last Thursday, we learnt about the many acts of service that encompassed Richard's life. In fact, the very church in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_South" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        where we gathered was not only supported by Richard, it started in their home, and the very footings of the building's walls were dug by Richard's own hands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dementia is a horrible disease, and it's gripping an increasing number of Australians. It was heartbreaking to see this disease afflicting Richard. But it did not stop Richard and Margaret's selfless service. Exemplifying this, Richard and Margaret signed up for a new WA police initiative called Safe and Found. This is a new service that helps people with cognitive impairments to be found more quickly if they go missing. To assist others, Richard and Margaret fronted an awareness campaign, including agreeing to feature in media stories about the new initiative. It would have been perfectly understandable for them to want to retreat and privately deal with Richard's dementia, but, true to form, Richard and his wife continued to put the interests of others ahead of their own.
       </p>
       <p>
        Richard's passing is a great loss, not just for his family but for the community that he served so well. His life is a testament to the power of community and how individuals can make a profound impact on the lives of others. His memory will live on as an inspiration to all who knew him.
