         I can inform the Senate again that all the appropriate steps were taken to ensure propriety was in place and that there was not and would not be a conflict of interest in relation to the role of my chief of staff and the company Australian Public Affairs. It was all done in a very thorough and diligent manner.

               I can advise the Senate that all information around my chief of staff was given to the Prime Minister's office in accordance with appropriate timing. Now, interestingly, we see yet again this attack on individuals from the opposition, rather than dealing with substantive policy issues. The substantive policy issues around the taking down of the website are those that instigated this line of questioning from the opposition.

                    I can indicate to the chamber that the proper processes were followed in terms of the timing—when I was provided with advice from my chief of staff. I think perhaps it might be useful to outline the facts for those on the other side who may not have been listening to my contributions this week relating to this matter. Those outside this chamber may also be interested to avail themselves of the facts—facts which are somewhat lacking in what we are seeing from the opposition in relation to this matter.

I refer to the minister's previous claim that she put arrangements in place at the commencement of her chief of staff's employment to prevent a conflict with his lobbying interests. Why was the minister not aware of those arrangements when she misled the Senate on Tuesday?
