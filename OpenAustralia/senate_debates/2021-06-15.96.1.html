        . Minister, I refer to the Murugappan family, which your government has detained for years, spending millions of dollars to deliberately harm two innocent children and their parents. Why did it take one of the children suffering from a potentially life-threatening illness for your government to show even the merest glimpse of compassion? Minister, why has this family not simply been allowed to return to their home in Biloela?

         for the question, because, Senator McKim, what it again shows the people of Australia is that, under the Greens, you will continue to allow people smugglers to exploit people by putting them on boats and drowning—around 1,200 drowned—and taking that perilous journey to Australia. Senator McKim, the question that you have put to me is a very real reminder for everybody in this chamber that, as a country, as a government, we are still today, in 2021, dealing with the legacy of border protection failure when both yourself and Labor were last in government. The Morrison government has made it very, very clear that only misery, human misery, can result from allowing people smugglers to conduct their ugly trade. Twelve hundred people—

           . The point of order is on relevance. I didn't ask about borders. I didn't ask about border protection. I didn't ask about the Greens' policy. I didn't ask about Labor policy. I just asked about one family and why they are not allowed to return home. That was the extent of the question.

             . The Morrison government has made it very clear that there can be no incentive for people to circumvent our orderly and generous migration system. In relation to the decision that has been made by the minister for immigration, he has decided that the

             will be released from held detention and they will be reunited in the Perth community. They will reside in suburban Perth through a community detention placement, close to schools and support services, whilst the youngest child receives medical treatment from nearby Perth Children's Hospital. But let me be very, very clear: this decision strikes a balance between the government's strong border protection policies and appropriate compassion in circumstances involving children in detention.

                I will reiterate what the relevant minister has reiterated, what previous ministers have reiterated and what the Prime Minister has reiterated. We have made it clear that, under our government, if you arrive here illegally you will not be permanently resettled here. We need to be very clear: today's decision by the minister for immigration does not create a fresh pathway to a visa. The government's position on border protection has not changed. Anyone who arrives in Australia illegally by boat will not be resettled permanently. Anyone who is not found to be owed protection—and, Senator

                  The government's argument that this family must be detained and mistreated to prevent people from coming to Australia by boat to seek asylum is an admission—is it not, Minister?—that Australia's immigration system is built on a foundation of torture. Minister, how many other government policies depend on the deliberate mistreatment of children and families to be effective?
