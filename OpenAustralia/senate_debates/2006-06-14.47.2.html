        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        , Senator Vanstone. Can the minister confirm that employers have to make a specific case before they can engage a worker on a temporary skilled migration visa? Can the minister explain whether there are any safeguards in place to ensure that these workers are actually employed in the specific field set out in their visa application? Isn’t it actually the case that there are no restrictions on what employers can force temporary skilled workers to do or even what industry they are employed in once they are in Australia? Doesn’t this totally undermine the case for these skilled workers being needed by particular employers in the first place?

                I know you do not need my apology, because I could see the goodwill with which you took my comment. I in fact saw you laughing. So you have that great Australian trait of being able to laugh at yourself—which is welcomed.
               </p>
               <p>
                The question that was asked was: are there any mechanisms to ensure that people are working in the areas for which they make application for a skilled temporary migrant visa? I think the fair answer to that is yes. Obviously, the people making the application have to convince the department that it is appropriate. We reject a lot of applications because, for example, the training commitment from a company is not there. In fact, one of your own colleagues—who is not here today—made a request that we place a 457 worker with a company, and we were not able to do so because the company did not have an adequate training record. There are plenty of occasions where we in fact reject applications on that basis. Unfortunately, your colleague did not put it in writing—otherwise, you can be sure, Senator, that you would be reading the correspondence in the paper.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is obviously the primary requirement that you tell us what you are going to do, and you are expected—just as you are in any other aspect of dealings with government—to live up to the commitments you make by way of application.

                         , as I should have raised it with you directly—is that Senator Vanstone suggested that she would leak any written request made to her by an opposition member. I object to the suggestion that she would abuse her ministerial position in such a way, and I want her to confirm whether that was what she was really saying.

                             In addition to the commitments that are made in the application, there is a process of review over the first year where companies are required to report back and there is also an arrangement for site visits. As is the case with any compliance matter, such as, for example, the number of containers coming into the country, Customs do not inspect every container. Why? Because they work on the basis of targeting their compliance work, as in fact we do. In addition to that, there is the consequence of someone not living up to their commitments. That consequence may well be losing the right to sponsor further workers. Since this visa is very much appreciated in industry, you will find that people are not keen to lose the right to sponsor.

                             will put in an application for a psychiatrist and ask the person to sweep the floors? No, I do not. Do you know why? Because, normally, industry put in an application for the workers they need, and they want those people to do those jobs. Why? So they can deliver better services and make Australian companies stronger and Australian jobs more secure. Australian jobs have never been more secure than they are now—thanks to good management of the economy and thanks to us not engineering a recession that we thought Australia had to have.
