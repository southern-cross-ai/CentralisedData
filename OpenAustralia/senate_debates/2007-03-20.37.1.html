        My question is to Senator Minchin, representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister’s announcement last night of an investigation into the provisions of bed licences to Russell Egan Jr and ask: if the Prime Minister has serious concerns about Senator Santoro’s time as Minister for Ageing, why did he allocate such a task to a yet-to-be-sworn junior minister as an aside during a press conference? Aren’t the public entitled to an independent investigation into Senator Santoro’s time as minister? Why won’t the Prime Minister order such an independent investigation? At the very least, will the government ensure that any inquiry looks at all decisions made by Senator Santoro and their relationship to his extensive shareholdings?

         I did not have the opportunity to see the Prime Minister on
         <i>
          The 7.30 Report
         </i>
         . I was doing what many of us do and attending a meeting of the state executive of the South Australian Liberal Party. Nevertheless, as I understand it, the Prime Minister was asked the question directly by Mr Kerry O’Brien and the Prime Minister indicated to Kerry O’Brien that he would ask the new Minister for Ageing to have a look at the matter. But, as I am advised, this question goes to the operations of the Superior Care group. The decision to allocate places to that company was made by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health and Ageing
         </a>
         . It was made by the department, and the department has already given extensive evidence to this effect in the Senate estimates hearings on 13 February 2007. I refer Senator Kerry O’Brien to that evidence.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I wonder if the minister would explain then why the Prime Minister did decide to refer the matter back for investigation by Mr Pyne if that was already a known fact. Given that the Prime Minister sought to cover up Senator Santoro’s breach of the government’s ministerial code of conduct, what guarantees can the minister give that the—

           Order! Senator O’Brien, I believe you did make an improper reflection on a person in the other place. I ask you to withdraw that.

Given the Prime Minister’s actions in relation to Senator Santoro’s breach of the code of conduct, what guarantees can the minister give that the investigation will be totally transparent and the finding made public? In the absence of an independent investigation, why should the public have any faith in your government’s ability to conduct such an inquiry with any integrity at all?

             I really have nothing further to add to the answer I gave earlier. But I would say that I think it is outrageous of Senator Kerry O’Brien to come into this place and accuse the Prime Minister of that behaviour. I think that is outrageous and I am pleased that he withdrew it. The Prime Minister has acted honourably throughout and has insisted on the highest standards from his ministers. As I said, the department has already given evidence on this matter of the Superior Care group. The department has advised that it is reviewing all the relevant documents from the 2006 aged-care approvals round for the Queensland and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
              South Coast

             planning region. The department advised it has no reason to believe that anything untoward occurred in the allocation process, and Minister Pyne will receive a report from the department by the end of the week.
