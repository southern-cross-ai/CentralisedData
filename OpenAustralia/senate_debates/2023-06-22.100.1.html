        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I refer to the state of the economy a year ago, when the Albanese government inherited a poor economic legacy from the Liberals and Nationals, with reference to economic data which showed that wages were stagnant, there was $1 trillion of debt with nothing to show for it, and there was the highest quarterly inflation this century, as well as challenging economic conditions globally. Can the minister please update the Senate on Australia's economic outlook since the Albanese Labor government began growing the economy, supporting businesses and boosting jobs and wages?

         I thank Senator Sheldon for his question. The Albanese government and those on this side are focused on delivering a better future for all Australians, and we understand that at the heart of that is a stronger economy and an economy in which all Australians can participate and from which all Australians can gain the benefit.
        </p>

         I know those opposite find the truth hard to bear at times, but the reality is that they left the economy in a terrible state. Their approach to economic management was defined by wastes and rorts and of course, as the good senator has reminded us, by a trillion dollars in debt with nothing to show for it. Of course, they did tell us, and they printed cups that told everybody, that they were in surplus, but, like so much under the Morrison Liberal government, it was just yet another announcement without any delivery—a slightly embarrassing one. They were left with a lot of merchandise they don't know what to do with—lots of merch. But there was a trillion dollars in debt with nothing to show for it. What else are they known for? Well, those opposite deliberately kept wages low.

           Those opposite might bellow all they like, but Australians know they were for lower wages. They were for lower wages and they continue to be. If you listen to Senator Cash on anything to do with industrial relations—Australian workers understand what she's saying—she wants their wages lower. You want their wages lower, Senator Cash. Australians know what you're all about. Australians know the ideological bent that you're all about.

                I know those opposite may not like to hear the fact that we actually have more people in work, more women in work, than ever before, and we've seen record jobs growth. That's a good thing for Australians. More than 465,000 jobs have been created since we came to office, and Australia has recorded significantly stronger employment growth than any of the major advanced economies. Since May 2022, jobs here have grown faster than in the

                , Japan, Germany and Canada. We know that the circumstances ahead are challenging. But, unlike those opposite, we are focused on stronger jobs growth and better wages growth.

                   We are a government focused on making sure we have a plan to make our economy stronger and more productive, and working with Australians, helping Australians, through challenging times. And our budget was carefully calibrated to take the pressure off the cost of living, rather than adding to it. At the same time, we're laying stronger foundations by making our economy more productive.

                   What we do know is that we had a wasted decade under those opposite. What we do know is that those opposite delivered the slowest decade of productivity growth in 60 years and it will take time to turn this around. What we do know is that those opposite were not supportive of wage increases for minimum wage workers. What we do know is that, for those opposite, lower wages were a deliberate design feature of their economic plan. Australians know what you were about. You're about lower wages for working people and less secure jobs.
