        with the Northern Territory election and commend Chief Minister Michael Gunner on being able to take a second term for himself and his team. I want to commend all the candidates of the

         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        who stood in the seats across the Northern Territory—such a vast territory that it is—and put in the
        <i>

        the hard work that the Labor Party has been doing, in particular through the COVID crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do think that we need to put on the record that this was the first election during the COVID pandemic, and I know that it was important for every single candidate to feel safe and to know that they were able to speak to the people across the Territory. I want to acknowledge the frontline workers, our health practitioners and the

        It is important to acknowledge the supporters and volunteers who come together at election time—the supporters who are in the background but who are very much at the forefront of driving hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres across the Territory to follow the Northern Territory Electoral Commission and their teams. It was a significant task even for the Northern Territory Electoral Commission to have the staff that they had and to conduct polls at all the booths that they had in some of the remotest regions of the Northern Territory. I commend you for your efforts in those areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        As difficult and as challenging as it is physically and geographically, we still have a lot of work to do in understanding why it is that First Nations voters are being disengaged in most of our remote regions of northern Australia—not just in the Northern Territory; it will also occur in Queensland, WA and also
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . So it's important that the Senate and the parliament make sure they resource the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Electoral Commission
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        We've seen a reduction in the workforce, especially with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
         AEC
        </a>
        and other federal agencies—in particular in the Northern Territory—like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
         Bureau of Meteorology
        </a>
        , just to name the two of those. If we had further, appropriate resourcing, we know we could have the educational and information programs out there across the regions as to why voting is significant, and to make sure it is in the languages. There are over 100 Aboriginal languages in the Northern Territory, so, whether they're local elections, state or territory elections or federal elections, we must make sure all are enrolled. I think ensuring that we are getting people on the roll so that they have their say when it comes to elections is a real challenge for every single senator and every single member of federal parliament.
