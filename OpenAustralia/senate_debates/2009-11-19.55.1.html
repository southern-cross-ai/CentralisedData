         Thank you to Senator Crossin for the question. It is a very good question because, of course, this nation has an expansive coastline that faces very severe risks from climate change. Over the weekend, on Saturday, I released a new report mapping the impacts of climate change on Australia’s coastal communities. The report,
         <i>
          Climate change risks to Australia’s coast
         </i>
         , is the first continental scale mapping of residential buildings at risk from climate change. It paints a picture of the widespread impacts of climate change on Australia’s coastlines and the risks posed to buildings located in the coastal zone. It details the risk to coastal infrastructure, services and industry in Australia as a result of climate change. It demonstrates that many coastal communities are vulnerable to impacts such as sea inundation and erosion. Between 157,000 and 247,600 existing residential buildings will be at risk from sea inundation by 2100 under a sea level rise scenario of 1.1 metres. The value of residential buildings in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         which was identified, was between $23½ million and $57.7 million.

          Some of those opposite may like to pretend that this is not real. The fact is that it is real. Climate change is a reality. The science tells us that the climate is changing faster than first projected and the impacts are likely to be more severe as sea level rises and extreme storms and floods become more frequent. These changes are already happening, and we cannot ignore the findings of this report. We cannot afford to ignore them, even if some on the other side would like to pretend this is not happening.

           . I notice that the report makes comments on the Nightcliff foreshore, which is critically important to our community, so I would like to know: what did the report warn about the impact of climate change on our infrastructure, and how do we best manage the costs of this impact?

            The major coastal infrastructure that underpins Australia’s economy, such as airports and ports, will be at risk from climate change. This is quite clearly demonstrated in the report. Sea level rise, more intense cyclones and ocean acidification will potentially increase both the capital costs and the operating costs of ports quite significantly by mid-century. A number of airports are also located in low-lying areas in the coastal zones and are at risk of inundation in the coming century.

                 I might remind the Senate of what Mayor Michael Regan, the Mayor of Warringah, said. He said that the release of the report was a big step forward and will help support local governments who have to make decisions about issues affecting coastal areas. The fact is that there remain many people in local government who have a far more progressive and far-sighted view on the issue of climate than those opposite, and I remind those opposite of what Mr Robert Doyle said in the
