         I was talking to this before the break. This is about inserting terms for long-distance transport workers. I was saying that I could not see a recommendation on this issue in the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations report on the Fair Work Bill 2008 provisions. Obviously this is a fairly contentious issue and there has been a fair bit of press about the blue-card system in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . By the same token, you want to make sure that there is safety and security on our roads as far as long-distance transport goes. Considering it is such a contentious issue, I strongly suggest to the committee that we send to a committee a reference—which I foreshadow—for amendment (2) to be looked at and well considered before we go about inserting it at the eleventh hour tonight. I think there are two views that need to be put forward strongly. We have heard the cases from the government and the opposition. We could spend a lot of time here continuing that debate, but I think the best way of resolving this is to send this particular amendment to a committee to be looked at and to have them report back to the Senate.

          There are still some issues at large in relation to this amendment. The first one, of course, is why the transport industry was not consulted but the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
           Transport Workers Union
          </a>
          was. The other issue is why this was not part of the original framework. The reason it was not part of the original framework, I suggest to the minister, is that under award modernisation we were going to have a framework that covered all awards but with this amendment we are carving out certain elements peculiar to the transport industry to give a huge leg-up to the Transport Workers Union in the terms described by Senator Williams before the dinner adjournment.
         </p>
         <p>
          In this, we understand that safety is going to become an issue in the award.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_health" rel="nofollow">
           Occupational health
          </a>
          and safety should be, I submit, a separate regime and not part of the award system. Once you allow it in for the trucking sector, guess who will be next? Why not, once the principle has been established, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
           CFMEU
          </a>
          and the construction sector or the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">
           MUA
          </a>
          in stevedoring? This was all about award modernisation—getting it all on the same footing—to ensure that we had a simple system, but here we are, sneaking in not only a special deal for transport but also a new safety principle. It is vitally important, do not get me wrong, but that is dealt with under an occupational health and safety regime, not through industrial awards. As soon as we open that gate again, the Transport Workers Union will be used as the precedent and you will see
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Reynolds" rel="nofollow">
           Kevin Reynolds
          </a>
          , the MUA and all the others coming in behind, saying, ‘The precedent’s been set; let’s go for it, boys.’
         </p>
         <p>
          I very seriously put to the Senate that government amendment (2) needs to be opposed for those reasons. I also think the Senate is entitled to an undertaking from the government—and they cannot give this undertaking—that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales

          system will not be transported into the national system and all around the country. Senator Williams outlined some of the corruption—I will use the word—

                   Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. The interesting thing is, I will use the word ‘corruption’ in relation to these practices. The reason I use the term ‘corruption’ is that the matters outlined by Senator Williams clearly amount to corruption. The minister has not sought to deny that this has, in fact, occurred. We all know that these kickbacks occur. Sure, there might be some legal definition in the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
                    Transport Workers Union
                   </a>
                   lexicon that does not make it corruption, that it is just deals among mates. But amongst humble suburban lawyers like me and people that represent the bush so exceptionally well, as Senator Williams does, we know that by the word ‘corruption’.

                   Let me just go through some of the situations that occur in

                   (State) Award in all jurisdictions. The consequences of that are that the Transport Workers Union will have the power to enter a workplace even if the company is not affiliated with the union. Union delegates will be free to inspect driving records and to order companies to provide documents as far back as six years. The award forces employees to complete a safety awareness program to obtain this blue card, with the company responsible—surprisingly—for paying all the costs. It is not the driver or anybody else; it is the company that pays for the blue card. As Senator Williams outlined, the company that provides the blue card is affiliated with the union and, of course, the union is affiliated with the

                   . Would the money trail be headed that way? Well, methinks so, but let us wait and see.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Employers will be forced to enrol their employees in the union in order to avoid the burden of union inspections in compliance with the award. People in the transport sector are telling us that the government is being told it risks making the road a more dangerous place if it imposes the New South Wales model nationwide. That is how serious this issue is. Keep aside the corruption aspect so well articulated by Senator Williams; you may or may not believe in that. But it is also an issue of road safety. Why do we say that? Because:

Can somebody explain to me whether somebody sitting behind the wheel of a truck is somehow more roadworthy if he earns $X per hour or $X+2 per hour? I thought we had a safety net under which people could not be paid—there would be award minima. So why would we need this public disclosure of payments? Do you know why? So the union has more power to influence the running of these businesses. The Queensland Transport Association believes it will inflict even more red tape. It really is, as NatRoads said, an industrial instrument that is ‘a legal mechanism to feather the nest of the Transport Workers Union’.

Usually I ask my colleagues on the crossbenches for an indication as to how they may vote, but on this occasion we feel that strongly that we will be dividing the chamber irrespective of support from the crossbenchers.

                      I am grateful for the contributions of Senator Williams and Senator Abetz in relation to this. As well as the matters raised by Senator Ludwig, I have had a discussion with the office of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in relation to this, and I am grateful for their assistance, because this is something that, as I understand it, was not part of the committee process. That is something that does concern me, because this amendment was, as I understand it, not subject to the scrutiny of the committee process.

                        It wasn’t in the bill originally, as Senator Williams helpfully points out. Yesterday I was contacted by Mr Steve Shearer from the South Australian Road Transport Association. He is a person who I have dealt with over the years both in my time in state parliament and since I have been here in the Senate, and I have always found him to be a very straightforward person to deal with. He expressed concerns about this particular amendment. His argument has been mirrored in part by Senator Williams. He said that there were very tough fatigue-management laws implemented nationally on 28 September 2008 and that the industry fully supports these laws. As I understand it, there is a concern, as has been expressed by Senator Williams, about the way that the

                       <p>
                        My first question to the minister is: can the minister advise whether the Deputy Prime Minister will amend the award modernisation request to make it absolutely clear that the

                        </a>
                        can include safety terms where they currently exist but not otherwise? In other words, can she make it absolutely clear that for all jurisdictions other than New South Wales this will not apply, given that there are already existing occupational health safety laws in other jurisdictions? Can the minister confirm on behalf of the government in explicit terms that it is not intended for this provision to allow duplicate safety regimes to be included in awards? I have some more questions after those, but I would be grateful if I could receive a response from the minister on those two matters in terms of some very explicit undertakings that what applies in New South Wales will not apply in any other jurisdiction. I have some subsequent questions that are dependent on the answers.

                         I will answer in part some of the wild allegations made by Senator Abetz. The straw-man reasoning that was being put forward was quite extraordinary. The circumstances are these: we as a government place on the public record that the minister will amend the award modernisation request to make clear that the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">

                         </a>
                         can include safety net terms where they exist—that is, in
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                         </a>
                         —but not otherwise. That means that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission can include safety net terms in New South Wales and not otherwise. To go on from that, it is a matter for the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIRC" rel="nofollow">

                         </a>
                         what those safety net terms are.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Senator Abetz, or the opposition, says that I should know about a whole range of things and that they are corrupt—that is what Senator Abetz was articulating. I am a little bit more careful with my words. I would say that if you were going to make those allegations—which are allegations—you would need to at least have personal knowledge of the facts of the matter before making them. I do not. Even if I had such personal knowledge, they would still only be allegations. I would certainly not assert as a matter of fact that these things existed. In relation to the second part—the question of whether they will be duplicated in existing safety net regimes across various states—these provisions are confined to New South Wales.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The industry has expressed concern that this provision is intended to introduce a new layer of regulation. It is not intended that this provision allow duplication of any other state safety laws to be included in modern awards. I place on record that the minister’s award modernisation request will make this clear. That answers definitively the two matters that Senator Xenophon raised and it deals with what I would call the straw-man reasoning being put forward on the other side.

                            It seems to me that the debate boils down to this, and I direct this also to Senator Williams and Senator Abetz: is it the case that, if this amendment fails, any provisions relating to safety that currently apply in

                            </a>
                            will no longer apply and, in the absence of occupational health and safety laws applying, there may well be some legal vacuum or hiatus? Is that what the government is saying? I would be grateful for any assistance from Senator Abetz or Senator Williams in relation to that, because I have to say that on the basis of what Senator Williams has said there are some issues of concern. I am not going to use the language that Senator Abetz used. In terms of what Senator Williams has raised, there are some concerns about the operation of those provisions in New South Wales and the impact on the New South Wales transport industry that may need—and I am putting this in fairly neutral terms—some tidying up sooner rather than later.

                             today. In New South Wales the Staysafe Committee is about to review the regulations in New South Wales because they say it is simply not working, it is a bundle of red tape and it has put extreme costs and pressures on the transport industry. That is why the Staysafe Committee will soon review these regulations.

                             Surely, no matter what the minister says today, he cannot guarantee that some other jurisdiction will not adopt similar policies. If this was to be wholly and solely in New South Wales, as it has been since 2005, why is it even in this chamber here now? New South Wales has had the regulations for almost four years and the minister is saying that this is to allow for some sort of concreting process for New South Wales laws. I do not think that is the case at all. The situation is that it is here now, it was not in the original Fair Work Bill and it has been slipped in by the government as an amendment, hence I will not support it in any way unless the minister gives an absolute, 100 per cent guarantee that this amendment in this bill will not allow this to proceed in any other state. But of course the minister cannot give that guarantee because any other state can bring in

                              , dealing with the range of matters that I discussed earlier this evening. It is not the intention of this government to destroy existing occupational health and safety provisions. It may be the opposition’s desire to do that. But having identified an issue it is incumbent upon this government to address that. We are addressing it in a narrow way. It is not saying that the award provision that exists in New South Wales will be mirrored; it is a matter for the

                              and hold on to today’s industrial relations provisions, but I cannot and would not guarantee to you what will happen tomorrow or the next day or the day after that if it means improvements to occupational health and safety across this country, particularly in industries such as the long-haul transport area. Why would I? And I would be surprised if the opposition were against improved occupational health and safety in long-haul transport. If you are not, then all this provision does is exactly that. If you have a problem with particular issues, if you think they are corrupt and you make the allegation that they are corrupt, there are plenty of places you can air that. You can air it in here at will or you can go outside, as I think you were invited to do. Neither of those options is what I am inviting you to do. If you think those things exist then take them up with the appropriate authorities to have them investigated. That is what I have always argued and that is the sensible course of action. If anybody would refute that then I question their motive.

But we also have this bizarre blue card system on top of all of that. Does it make the roads safer? We submit that it does not. Does it add to bureaucracy and red tape, which impinge on the viability of small business? Yes, it does. Does the blue card also give extra powers—excessive powers—to the

What he is saying is that the National Transport Commission regulations are not good enough, the Roads and Traffic Authority fatigue guidelines are not good enough and the Occupational Health and Safety Act long-distance fatigue regulations are not good enough, so we need the award. Every other state seems to have been able to deal with these issues without dealing with them in this—I will not use the word ‘corrupt’ on this occasion—peculiar manner. People can read into that what they like. Also, this New South Wales award will, as I understand it, expire in 2014. What happens then?

                                 Chances are the blue card will be dispensed with because, as Senator Williams just quietly interjected, the

                                 will have enough money by then. Whether that is the case or not, the question is: what is going to happen with the road safety regulations after that?

                                 I suggest that the legislated regulations under the various acts that I have already referred to are sufficient and that the blue card is simply a front for the funding purposes that I have outlined. If it were so vital you would think there would be a mechanism to ensure that the

                                  My position is as follows. I am grateful to the minister for the very clear undertakings that have been given. However, I think that there are still some concerns that have been raised by Senators Williams and Abetz in relation to this. So out of an abundance of caution I will not support this amendment. But I can indicate that I am prepared to continue to discuss this with the government overnight, because I figure we are going to be back here tomorrow. I do not know whether Senator Ludwig is smiling or—

                                          No, go slow. As a result, we were dealing with each amendment in turn, rather than en bloc. The minister has now indicated that after this tranche we will go to the issue of small business. Therefore I can indicate to Senator Siewert that, yes, we do want a separate vote on government amendment (2) but after that we would be happy to deal with them en bloc.

                                             This amendment recognises the importance of consultation with employees in circumstances where an employer has decided to introduce major changes that are likely to have a significant effect on employees. It is longstanding industrial practice that awards provide for consultation in these circumstances. For example, in the important matter of redundancy, the 1984 redundancy test case recognised that consultation about major change is highly desirable and that representation in this process is appropriate. The arrangements worked well for over 20 years, until consultation clauses were rendered non-allowable by the Workplace Relations Act.

                                             There are a couple of matters that it is important to note in this debate. Firstly, the provision allows Fair Work Australia to determine the most appropriate arrangements for consultation and representation. It is a matter for Fair Work Australia to make those decisions. Secondly, the proposed amendment requires awards to provide a process for consultation and requires representation as part of that process. It would not impinge on employers’ ability to manage their businesses and would not allow for arbitrated outcomes to be imposed on businesses. Those are two very important matters that we should recognise.

                                              The opposition opposes this amendment as well. This amendment will change the situation in relation to modern awards. The opposition says that there is no requirement for this provision as the draft modern awards already contain such a provision. But, importantly, it removes the qualification in the modern awards system that no employer is required to disclose confidential information if such disclosure would be contrary to the employer’s interests. This allows for the representation of those for the purposes of that consultation. Matters in relation to, let us say, a publicly listed company could potentially be divulged prior to the stock market and shareholders being advised, and we do not think that is a good course of action. This is another one of these amendments that have been rushed in at the end and that were not properly aired at the Senate committee.

                                                  I do not think Senator Collins is sitting in her usual seat. Undoubtedly she has had an enjoyable sojourn out of the chamber and is now back to make a contribution, which is always interesting. We say that the first aspect of the amendment is unnecessary and we are concerned about the consequences, especially when it says that an award must include a term that ‘requires an employer to whom the award applies to consult the employer’s employees to whom the award applies about major workplace changes that are likely to have a significant effect on the employees’. It makes sense that those sorts of changes may also have a significant effect on the share price, and there we have the conflict. That is why we as an opposition are opposed to this clause.

                                                   strongly support this amendment. You can bet that if the opposition oppose it we will be supporting it. We believe it is an important amendment allowing an important and longstanding term in the modern awards, particularly important in the current economic circumstances in which many businesses will in fact be restructuring. But it is also important at all times when businesses make such significant decisions. So we will be strongly supporting government amendment (3).

                                                    The position that is now being put by the opposition about this clause is, frankly, quite extraordinary. If it meant what the opposition thought, then surely that was the main argument put by the employers in 1984, which was the redundancy test case. But, clearly, it did not persuade them to not deal with the redundancy test case, which recognised that consultation about major change is highly desirable and that representation in this process is appropriate. If there are laws which require things such as market sensitive information to be released at a particular time, then I have no doubt that the company or the corporation will abide by those. They may go to the employees at the same time, if the provision allows for it, or shortly thereafter, if the provision allows for it. It is common sense to allow it to really come to the fore, because to do otherwise would say that the employer would not be able to consult about major change because it could be market sensitive. I do not know what those circumstances may or may not be. I do know that it is important to consult. The corporation does have an overriding requirement to meet the relevant corporations legislation, and I have got no doubt they would not breach their
                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">

                                                    requirements. But it does not mean that they should rule out, as a consequence, talking to their employees about the major change, especially where the major change is going to impact upon and have a significant effect on the employees. I think it is an unsurprising clause. I am sorry if the opposition have read more into it than is there.

                                                    It is about consultation. But then, when you look at the history of what the Liberals did in relation to these provisions about consultation, clearly what is at the heart of the Liberals is a born-to-rule mentality which says: we have a right to manage our business the way we want to manage it and we do not want to consult with anyone, even our employees, about our business. That seems to be what is at the very heart of the provisions. That seems to be why consultation was ripped from the Workplace Relations Act. It seems to be why the Liberals think consultation is such an anathema, especially when it comes to employees. It seems to underscore the view that they do not want to consult with employees at all, because, if that were the case that Senator Abetz was putting, then I would say to him: describe the circumstances where it is okay to consult—otherwise, is it that clear that you do not want consultation at all? What this clause does is allow for consultation to be included, and of course it is a term that must be included in an award so that it ‘requires an employer to whom the award applies to consult the employer’s employees to whom the award applies about major workplace changes’. I think it is unsurprising. I think what it means is reasonably plain, and it does allow for those employees to be represented. There is little more that I can add in respect of that other than to comment that it is not surprising to me that the Liberals on the other side are opposed to consultation.

                                                     I think this evening we have got the great juxtaposition in Australian politics. We on the coalition side actually believe that consultation means that you talk through the issues with people before you announce the decision. We have now heard from the minister that, for the Labor Party, consultation includes the possibility of making the decision, going to the share market and announcing it, and then talking to the workers. Silly me! I thought consultation actually meant talking to people about the issues before you made the final decision! What the minister has now put up in lights—I think, very effectively—is the different approaches of the coalition and the Labor Party in relation to the issue of consultation. If it is as the minister asserts, and I see no legal precedent for this, he has basically admitted that the corporations power may require the employer not to consult beforehand with the employees—that point was basically accepted—and he said common sense would need to prevail. I happen to agree with that. But if there is a conflict, as there will be, which one is to prevail? I was foolish enough to think consultation meant you actually had to talk through the issues with people before you made the decision. If consultation does not mean that, that is reassuring, but I think that is the Labor interpretation of the term, as opposed to the legal interpretation of the term. It is, in fact, the legal interpretation of the term that we have to concentrate on and deal with this evening. Given what the minister has said, I think it has, in fact, strengthened very substantially the case for the opposition to oppose amendment (3).

                                                      I do not know if it is helpful for Senator Ludwig to talk about the opposition having a ‘born-to-rule’ mentality, although right now going through this debate I feel it is a case of ‘born to ruin’ on my part. I read this amendment relatively narrowly. What it requires is for an employer to have a discussion and to consult with workers about changes that are being planned, not prior to the changes being planned, but to inform them: ‘These are the changes. We are letting you know we are going to discuss them and consult with you about them.’ I read the amendment relatively narrowly, closer to the government’s position, and I indicate my support for this amendment.

I am all for consultation but, as we know, sometimes minds are made up even before the consultation is done. I think employers know how to run their business and, if we start assuming employers do not do the right thing, you can see a need for creating a lot more of these sorts of amendments. If you also came from the perspective that workers do not do the right thing, you would end up with a heck of a lot more clauses. I have weighed it up and I do not think that the insertion of this amendment is that necessary. I am persuaded by the opposition in this regard so I will not be supporting this amendment.

                                                        ’? That is our concern. If that would be acceptable to the government, then we could have a way through this.

                                                        Minister, I have a hunch that this might come back to the Senate in any event. If that were to be the case then we could knock out this amendment but indicate the opposition’s willingness to revisit it on its return for the purposes of putting in an amendment which, of course, allows for consultation. You would expect a good employer to do that in any event, but we do not want the consultation mandated in the legislation in circumstances where the good employer might say, ‘Well, under this act I have to, but under another one, if it gets out, I would be in breach of the Corporations Act.’ So I give that as an option to the minister as to which way he would prefer to handle it.

That would be my understanding of how it would work. It is a source and stream argument. An award is not equal to, in that sense, a corporations act. You would expect the corporations act to be the relevant piece of legislation that the Corporations Law would have to apply to.

On that basis we will have a division and I think the government will probably lose this amendment, but we will have overnight to consider how we do what I would call a belt-and-braces effect, to see if we can save the important part of consultation. I am sure these were probably arguments that were run back in 1984, which is a bit Orwellian, I have to say. The position would have been made clear. It read then and still reads today that, when an employer has made a definite decision to introduce major changes to production, programs, organisation structure or technology that are likely to have a significant effect on employees, the employer shall notify the employees who may be affected by the proposed change in their union or unions. It goes on to explain what ‘significant effects’ are. It contemplates notification in this instance about a

                                                         provision. It is expressed in similar terms, although we have used the term ‘employee’s representatives’.

                                                         We note the provisions are also mandatory in certified agreements, but they have not been picked up. We have said that they are, in effect, mandatory. We have said in respect of our position that a modern award must include the term ‘requires’. It is the same in the sense that TCR provisions are also mandatory, and so is this. It is about the heart of the issue, which is consultation. It is about ensuring employers consult with employees in these circumstances. I think it boils down to nothing more nor less than that.

It would have been argued back in 1984. It was removed from the Workplace Relations Act by the Liberals and now we are simply seeking to ensure that we go back to a circumstance where employees do get to be consulted about these provisions. As I have said—and I will not keep the debate going any longer—we will test it and then we might have a look at it overnight.

                                                          Without delaying any further, any advice that the minister gets and cares to share with me tomorrow would be helpful in that regard. The clause that the minister read out, interestingly, as I heard it, had the words ‘has made’. When it says ‘employer has made’, that suggests that the change has already been made, whereas in this we are talking about changes that are ‘likely to have a significant effect’, and that suggests the future. That is the bind that I foresee employers being in. Requiring them to consult after a decision has been made as to how it will all work out makes good sense—I agree with that—but requiring them to consult beforehand, in circumstances where that could impact on the share price, would mean they would be between two Commonwealth laws.

But the problem is that this legislation is also Commonwealth legislation and is mandatory inasmuch as it says—without limiting a certain paragraph—‘a modern award must include’, and then there is the provision. So that award will be clothed with the authority of a Commonwealth piece of legislation which actually mandates it. Therefore, I am not sure that the argument of the minister would be upheld. Having said that, if the government has good advice for us tomorrow, I am more than open to reconsider my position. That is all I have to say. I suggest we move to the vote.

                                                            The government proposes a series of amendments in relation to the provisions dealing with modern awards and wages. The amendments provide limited scope for Fair Work Australia to delay wage increases through national minimum wage orders, similar to that which already exists in the bill for award wage rates; provide additional protection for employees in relation to deduction from wages; and ensure that the amount of the high-income threshold cannot be reduced through regulation. The high-income threshold determines when an award ceases to apply to an employee with guaranteed annual earnings and whether an award- or agreement-free employee has access to an unfair dismissal remedy. It also enables an employer and prospective employee to agree to a guarantee of annual earnings before the prospective employee commences employment. There are other minor technical amendments that flow as a consequence of that.

On balance, we will be voting against them—I indicate that, in case there is support from the crossbenches for that on the voices. We are concerned that these further amendments will permit awards to retain state based differences based on certain peculiar circumstances. This, of course, is a substantial wind-back of the position that awards should provide a national uniform safety net for an industry without state based differences. This will, we believe, permit union friendly deals in a particular state to be retained regardless of whether they are an appropriate safety net. Of course, we have had that discussion already in relation to item (2). I will leave my comments there.

My recollection is, unless the advisers can tell me otherwise, that many of these types of arguments have been run in commissions over many, many years. Significant drought might be another example—a lengthy, sustained drought where exceptional circumstances have applied and the industry is suffering significant hardship as a consequence. You could imagine those types of arguments would be examples of where the commission may take that into account.

I just want to indicate that the Greens will be supporting these amendments, even though we are not very happy, as you can tell from our amendment, which we will be discussing later on, in terms of the high-income threshold. But we will be supporting (12) and (13), particularly because we think that the provision, given that it is going to exist, is an important protection against future governments actually undermining the award system by lowering the threshold. As I said, we think a preferable amendment is the one that we will be moving, even though the government have already signalled that they will not be supporting it. As we are unlikely to persuade the chamber about our approach, we think it is good to put these protections around it, so we will be supporting these amendments.

I know that my colleague Senator Boyce wants to make a contribution and will be indicating to the Senate some excellent research she has done on what others consider to be the appropriate number in relation to a small business. We as an opposition say that the number should be 25. We note that Senators Fielding and Xenophon are of the view that it ought be 20 and the government is at this stage, I think along with the Greens, saying that it ought be 15.
                                                                 </p>

                                                                  Is there any magic around any particular figure? No, there is not. The question really is, from our point of view: what is the figure that is most conducive to seeing employment growth in the small-business sector? We have been concerned to ensure that some of the obstacles that have been in the way of small business employing people be removed. Whilst I will not traverse that which has now been rejected and thrown out, one of the motivations in the past for the threshold of 100 by the then government was that it would see a huge growth in employment. I still remember when the change was made, when unemployment was where it is today, that we said we dared to hope to have unemployment with a figure of four in front of it. When we left office we had failed: the unemployment level did not have a four in front of it. In fact, it had a three in front of it: 3.9 per cent. It was beyond that which we had dared to dream about—and, of course, each part percentage point that unemployment came down meant thousands more of our fellow Australians had gainful employment.
                                                                 </p>
                                                                 <p>
                                                                  When you talk to small business, there is no doubt about the unfair dismissal laws as they were coupled with the prospect of go-away money. I think Mr Beazley and Mr Rudd even admitted, during the election campaign and in the lead-up to it, that go-away money was a problem. A small business would be told, ‘Unless you pay us $2,000 or $3,000 we will be requiring you to front up, with a union representing us’—as a result, no legal fees—but the small business, of course, would have to engage a lawyer. I remember circumstances such as this, even when a small business won, when as a lawyer I had to say to people, ‘We can win this case, but you’ll have to pay me possibly $5,000 to $10,000, so a commercial decision is to offer them three or four and do a deed of release’—and each time it worked a treat. It was unfair and unreasonable, and within the small business community it led to people saying, ‘We will not employ people.’

We say the seismic change to 15 is not quite far enough, but we do accept the verdict of the Australian people that they viewed the figure of 100 as excessive. I know Senator Boyce will give us some interesting information about what others think the appropriate threshold is. I recall previously in this debate reminding people that the

While the figure of 100 had, I believe, a great impact and was very beneficial in providing employment opportunities, a lot of people said it came at a cost that was unacceptable to the Australian people in relation to uncertainty. We accept that. That is why we think in the wash-up a figure of 25 is reasonable.
                                                                 </p>

They went to the election in relation to Forward with Fairness which mentioned the number 15. I say to the government: I think they would have had us snookered if they had come into this place with legislation that only replicated Forward with Fairness. But of course they have not. Labor made very strong promises in relation to the right of entry, when Ms Gillard was even willing to do something with her mother—I am not quite sure what it was, but she was willing to offer her mother if she were to break this solemn promise to the Australian people in relation to right of entry. We now know in the legislation before us that she has in fact broken that promise, albeit the latest amendments are getting back towards that promise.
                                                                 </p>

                                                                  Unfortunately, the government can now no longer claim that it has a mandate, because if it were to assert the mandate argument it would have to present legislation which was identical to Forward with Fairness—and I think all of us around this chamber know that that is not the case. Therefore, I think they have disallowed themselves from using the mandate argument. But, as I say, they may well have been able to snooker us on that if their legislation had only been Forward with Fairness. What they have done is said, ‘We do have to adjust it a bit here and there to accommodate certain other considerations.’ We say, ‘Well, if you are going to engage in that game, it is open to everybody to engage in that game; we therefore suggest the figure of 25.’

I think we need to look at why there is an exemption from the unfair dismissal provisions for small business. It is about whether small business has the resources and the capacity to fulfil the legal, the technical and the regulatory requirements that, as Senator Abetz pointed out, can cost companies over and over again. I would like to go through what some other countries do in terms of what constitutes a small business. As Senator Abetz pointed out, by international standards our definition of a ‘small business’ is very low. The ABS defines a small business as having 20 or fewer workers and a medium businesses as having 20 to 199. But the majority of world regulatory agencies define a small business as having up to 50 employees. The

Those agencies all say 50 employees and a turnover of under $20 million. That is vastly different from what we allege will give business the sorts of resources to cope with the regulatory framework of unfair dismissal provisions.
                                                                  </p>

As I said, the OECD says that a small firm is fewer than 50 employees and micro-enterprises up to 10. The ILO—which, as I have said here before, can hardly be seen as an economically conservative organisation—says that small firms are considered to be those with fewer than 50 employees, and it puts an upper limit of 200 on a medium sized business.

A highly labour intensive business such as a factory, a milk bar or a sandwich shop might employ a lot more people than, for instance, an
                                                                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">

For most manufacturing and mining industries, up to 500 employees and a turnover of about A$11 million is considered a small business. It goes on: for wholesale traders, they work on a definition of under 100 employees and with annual receipts below A$52 million. They have tailored the cloth to suit the type of business—certainly not something we have done here.

We have worked on the basis that we think we can improve this legislation by proposing that it move to 25 full-time employees, not 15 head count. I suggest that 15 head count does not represent the sort of business that has the capacity to understand regulation and spend their time worrying about the legal side of how to undertake a dismissal—not ‘fairly’ but according to the rules, which is far more what it is about. The vast majority of employers would wish to dismiss someone simply because they do not suit the job; they would wish to dismiss them fairly. But if they do not tick all the right boxes at all the right times, they can end up being subject to the sorts of prosecutions and costs that Senator Abetz talked about before.
                                                                  </p>

Why do they not just honestly say, ‘We want to get rid of the unfair dismissal exemptions altogether’? When you get down to a head count of 15, you are talking about busy milk bars, sandwich bars and other organisations that might have two or three full-time employees—perhaps even husband and wife—and a lot of casuals coming in to help out. These are not the sorts of organisations that have the resources and the capacity. This government does not really care about whether businesses have resources or capacity to undertake the technical aspects of meeting unfair dismissal requirements; what they really care about is making the playing field as uneven as possible for small business. Why not just be honest and say, ‘We want to get rid of the exemption altogether; we want everyone to be immediately liable to meet the unfair dismissal provisions’?

I think we all pretty well agree around the chamber that small businesses need to be treated specially and differently, so that is not the debate on this point. It is just defining what a small business is, and I will speak on that further. Without pre-empting the will of the chamber, I think we will find that there may be more support for 20 than for 25 employees.

My position is this: a reasonable definition for a small business in the context of unfair dismissal legislation would be 20 full-time employees. This is about taking into account the difference between the capacity of a small business to deal with an unfair dismissal claim and that of larger businesses which may have

I think Senator Abetz makes a point about unfair dismissal claims—and I have done a few in my time, many years ago, for both employers and employees—that there is in those claims an element of commercial decisions being made where the merits were not the primary consideration. That is certainly unfortunate.

It is administratively simpler and there is a fair dismissal code, and I think it is important that we take that into account. Workers in a small business will still have a statutory protection. There will still be a requirement for a warning in accordance with the code. There still will be a provision for natural justice. There still will be an ability to access relief if it is unfair. But it makes it simpler for small businesses, without the fear of being embroiled in costly litigation, as long as they comply with the code and do the right thing.
                                                                    </p>

Whilst the government says there ought to be some consistency in the number 15 for redundancies and unfair dismissal claims, I see as two distinct concepts the entitlement for redundancy payout and the ability to make a claim for an unfair dismissal, whether those are via the code or not. My position is that the two should be kept separate. I do not want to see any change to the redundancy provisions that are currently proposed. I do not want us to shift from the figure of 15, but unfair dismissal claims are a separate matter altogether and I ask the chamber to consider that difference between my amendment and that of Senator Fielding. Again, it is not a criticism of Senator Fielding, but it is a different approach with respect to that.

Then we can have rolling divisions to save senators being brought back and forth to the chamber, and have those divisions straight after. The difference between the amendment proposed by Senator Xenophon and that proposed by Senator Fielding has been recognised by the coalition. In our raft of amendments on sheet 5739 revised 2, we did have that provision for redundancy to which Senator Xenophon refers.

Let me start from the beginning of this debate. One of the defining issues in the lead-up to the 2007 federal election was workplace relations. The Rudd government, when in opposition, took a particular position on workplace relations and argued it daily across the country—from every opposition frontbencher, from every backbencher, from the Leader of the Opposition and from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We released our Forward with Fairness policy in April 2007 and the policy implementation plan in August 2007. It was not something we put under the carpet. It was not something we did not tell the electorate we were going to do. We made it central to our election platform for the November 2007 election—central; it was a key part of Forward with Fairness. The key part: the unfair dismissal provisions contained within it. It was a chapter of its own. The Howard government took away most from Australian workers any right to challenge a dismissal that was harsh, unjust or unfair.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        I think it is important at this point to clearly expand on another key element of the government’s unfair dismissal provisions, which were also taken to the Australian people in November 2007 and which are contained in this bill: small businesses with fewer than 15 employees will have a 12-month period of grace free from an unfair dismissal claim to determine whether an employee fits in their business. For businesses with 15 or more employees, that period is six months. I think by any measure that is enough time to judge whether an employee is going to work out or not. However, just to ensure that the process remains simple, fair and flexible for employers and employees, we said we would develop a streamlined small business fair dismissal code. If employers need to get rid of an employee because they are not doing their job properly, once again, the Fair Work Bill fulfils this election commitment.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>

For all the users of a system—large and small employers and their employees, and for all of those that Senator Boyce would sentence to ignorance—we promised a better process in Fair Work Australia to ensure that employers and employees were brought together quickly and professionally to deal with these claims in a non-legalistic manner. The Deputy Prime Minister repeatedly pointed this out. On page 18 of

It was chosen as a definition based on a headcount, counting full-time, part-time, and regular and systematic casual employees. There are sensible and logical reasons as to why this number and method of counting was chosen. The formulation of fewer than 15 full-time, part-time, and regular and systematic casual employees reflects a long-standing definition of ‘small business’ in the workplace relations arena. It was adopted by the full bench of the

They can look at a roster, count their staff by name and know whether they are in the unfair dismissal process or whether they are not. This definition remained for redundancy pay eligibility even under the coalition. They kept that provision until 2005, when the former Howard government, without reference to the Australian people, introduced Work Choices, which, bizarrely, changed it to any small business with fewer than 100 employees.

They may forgive me for saying this, but there is no logic or rationale to any of the proposals they put forward. They are complex, unwieldy, uncertain and quite frankly unworkable. The opposition wants a small business to be defined as having fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees for the purposes of unfair dismissal and fewer than 15 employees based on a head count for redundancy. The logic escapes me. Senator Xenophon wants a definition of fewer than 20 full-time equivalent employees for the purposes of unfair dismissal and a head count of fewer than 15 employees for redundancy. Senator Fielding wants a definition of fewer than 20 full-time equivalent employees for the purposes of unfair dismissal and fewer than 15 full-time equivalent employees for redundancy.
                                                                       </p>

But in the debate no-one has attempted to explain how full-time equivalent positions will be worked out. They have said in part that it will be left to regulation—‘Let someone else work it out; let someone else figure out how we’re going to do this.’ In other words, they will put it into the hands of a writer of regulations to sort out how this will actually work.
                                                                       </p>

We hear the argument from the other side that small businesses are under the pump. We accept that. We hear that they have little time, because they are too busy running their business. We accept that. We hear that they will have little time to address some of these matters. We accept that. So what does the Labor Party propose? We propose fair and simple ways for them to deal with unfair dismissal. They can use the small business code to dismiss employees. It is simple to work out whether you are subject to this in the first six months or 12 months by counting your employees. In a small business, you know them by name; you know each and every one of them by name. That is a very simple process. You can see them, you can count them and you can easily write down on a sheet how many you have.
                                                                       </p>

But just think about what the regulation would have to deal with. What are ordinary full-time hours? How will overtime hours be treated? What about a business with a seasonal work force or a business with fluctuating hours from week to week? Over what period will the hours be averaged—a week, a month or a year? And so it goes on. I do not have to use just those examples. I am sure that all around here can think up many more that show why it would (a) be difficult, (b) be complex and (c) not always provide the right answer. It might change and vary, and that leaves it open for debate as to whether or not you have those employees there or not.
                                                                       </p>

These amendments make it more complicated, not simpler. We want to be able to provide a special guide for small businesses on all the laws related to termination of employment on redundancy and unfair dismissal.

                                                                       <p>
                                                                        One of the reasons why the opposition and, it appears, Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding say that they want to make these amendments is because of the economic climate. On this side of the Senate, we think that in good economic times and difficult economic times employees are entitled to job security. They need some protections. Small business owners need to be able to walk into their staffrooms, count the people in there and know what their legal obligations are without spending hours of their time on a computer with pay records to work out what their full-time equivalents are or could be.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        The opposition says that they will judge this legislation on a number of tests. We have heard them iterate those tests this evening. Does it extend union power? Clearly, no. This is about small business and about ensuring that there is a small business code. It is about ensuring that small business has certainty. So, tick, it meets that; it does not fall under that wheel. Does it provide a disincentive for employment? No; clearly, it does not. Every business has a minimum of six months to test a new employee to make sure that they fit in with their business. All the evidence set out in the explanatory memorandum makes it clear that employment security law has no significant effect on employment decisions. Another test that the opposition use is: does it go beyond what the Labor Party took to the last election? No. It meets our policy commitments to the letter.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        But we know that this is not about the tests that the opposition have set in this debate. I listened closely to Senator Boyce’s contribution. Curiously, it reminded me of what Senator Joyce said this morning at the Senate doors. He said that opposition policy was about providing that small businesses with fewer than 25 employees should be exempt from unfair dismissal laws and so the definition of ‘small business’ must be changed. Senator Boyce harked to the same argument, using the term ‘exempt’. The opposition want to exempt small business from the operation. Examples from across the globe were given using the phrase ‘exempting small business’. There were arguments about whether it should be 50, and a range of other proposals were put forward.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        I have news for both Senator Boyce and Senator Joyce. They are not exempt. It is simply a modified scheme that applies to employees of small business. The opposition, as demonstrated by both Senator Joyce and Senator Boyce, argue and completely expose their inability to grasp the basic element of the unfair dismissal scheme we put forward, which shows that this debate is not about good public policy from the opposition and it is not about principle from the opposition; it is in their very heart that they cannot let Work Choices go. They want to argue and argue about maintaining unfair dismissal in the way that they have reflected it by exempting small business, and they continue to make that point even this evening.

The Greens position very strongly is that we believe in universal access to unfair dismissal laws and in fact we do not really support the government’s level of 15, and we have made that extremely clear. But we have said that we are prepared to wear that because they did go to the electorate with that figure during the election. We will not be supporting any move above 15 because we do not believe that people working in small business should have different rights with respect to unfair dismissal rules.

That is about the only thing that Senator Boyce has said that I agree with. I think they should give it to everybody and get rid of the 15-person limit.

They used it last night, although I will again note that they did not support the Greens’ very sensible amendment to ensure that the fair work legislation was in fact consistent and gave effect to ILO conventions. However, after having knocked our amendments off, the coalition still uses the ILO definition. It is interesting to look at the ILO definition. Their resolution states that small- and medium-sized enterprises are defined according to national custom and practice. This bill is setting the national custom and practice at 15.

So it is not fair or right to be quoting the ILO definition for a small enterprise at a certain level when it is in fact up to us to set that. Australia’s custom and practice has, since 1984, been 15. We do not agree with the practice but this bill is giving effect to that custom. The ILO convention in relation to this issue also states that exclusions are permitted in relation to:
                                                                          </p>
                                                                          <p class="italic">

                                                                          </p>

What we do not accept is that businesses of 20 staff, or particularly of 20 full-time-equivalent employees, have special problems of a substantial nature in relation to the scheme for unfair dismissal in this bill.
                                                                          </p>

                                                                           So can we please drop any reference to and abuse of ILO conventions to justify your definition of small business to try to jack it up to 20 or 25 full-time-equivalent employees, which we all know exceedingly well means that in reality you want to hike it up to 50 or 60 because full-time-equivalents means counting in part-time and casual people so that of a sudden we will have businesses included here that have 50 or 60 employees. I think we are getting closer and closer to that magic number of 100 again, don’t you? That is exactly what they are trying to do. They are trying to undermine the government’s election promise of 15, which the Greens were never supportive of—but we think it is a hell of a lot better than 20 or 25 full-time-equivalent employees. So we will not be supporting any move away from that number.
                                                                          </p>

                                                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">

It is messy to have two different definitions of small business, but of course it achieves their objective of trying to hike it up so that more and more people do not have proper access to unfair dismissal rights.
                                                                          </p>

Research has shown that it was the vulnerable workers—women, young people and those in vulnerable jobs—who were the most affected by Work Choices. And here we have the coalition—and, yes, I am going to bring out the dead body again, because we have to keep reminding people that that is what is driving this agenda—who keep saying they have put the knife in the heart of Work Choices, but in fact they have not. They keep trying to drag it back. This amendment will once again affect the most vulnerable workers in our community, the same way Work Choices does. That is why the coalition want to raise this limit to 20 or 25. The Greens will not be supporting it. We put the government on notice very clearly—we have in the past and we will once again—that we will not be supporting any move to increase this threshold from 15.
                                                                          </p>

The Greens will not support it. We will not wear it. This is a return to Work Choices, which clearly undermined workers’ rights and clearly enabled people to be unfairly dismissed. We will not support it. It is not part of a fair industrial relations system and it is taking us back to Work Choices.

This is about supporting them, and job creation, in terms of their confidence. I think it is fair to say that I would not be moving this if it meant that there was no protection. But instead there is a simplified code—a fair dismissal code—which I think will give those small employers comfort in terms of dealing with these matters in a streamlined fashion. It is about giving those small businesses the confidence to continue to take on people. A threshold of 15 is simply too low.

Twenty is the threshold; it is a consistent figure in legislation.

I know the government says that this should be for both the good times and the bad times, and I accept that, but given that the government has had two stimulus packages, and the thrust of those was about making sure that there was confidence in the economy, I think that it is important that we do not lose sight of the nervousness of small businesses to take on staff. And the fact is that there will be a statutory safeguard through the unfair dismissal code—and that, to me, is a fundamental issue to be considered in relation to this.
                                                                           </p>

That is something that can be calculated and the amendment does provide for regulations to put that in place. I respect the Greens’ position and I respect the government’s position but I think the figure 20 is more realistic in the context of what a definition of a small business is in this country.

The debate we have had is about whether the threshold should be 15, 20 or 25, and whether it be full-time, full-time equivalent or simply a head count of the people working in an enterprise. One gets the clear impression that it would not matter what number was put forward by the government here, there would be argument, from the opposition at least—if not the Independents on the cross bench—that it ought be higher. Of course, the same lobbying forces would apply. But here is the question to Senator Xenophon,
                                                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">

                                                                             </a>

                                                                            </p>

                                                                             Senator Boyce shakes her head to say yes. I ask that a little bit of thought be given to that, and I ask that a little bit of probity and responsibility be brought to this question. There are important issues in this legislation about the relationship between employers and employees in a country which is defined by the term—to quote the frequent statement of the last Prime Minister—‘a fair go’. Is it a fair go to have the Australian people back at the ballot box because the opposition and two crossbenchers in this place did not accept the adjudication of the Australian people at the last ballot box? I do not think so. I think it would be very easy to get locked into a pursuit of supplanting the figure 15 with 20 or 25 as a test of wills, but the consequences would be quite great, if not quite grave. I do not think the Australian people want to be confronted with a vote again by an intransigent opposition or two members of the crossbench on this defining matter.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                             The government was elected by the Australian people, above all issues, rejecting Work Choices. The government made it clear—and who of us watching this matter can forget—that it would define ‘small business’ in the context of this legislation as one with 15 or fewer employees. It was very, very clear to the Australian people in 2007, and they endorsed it.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                             I say to my colleagues in this place who might want to make a stand on this: this is not the issue that should bring down this legislation. If there is some other matter then let it be brought forward. The argument will be had about why the number of employees should be five or indeed 10 higher. We will hear about the changed economic climate, but the argument goes both ways. That economic climate also makes it tougher on employees. We are talking about circumstances in which, for every employer, there are 15 employees. All components of this Senate recognise that 15 is not the cut-off as far as a rejection of any further unfair dismissal provision is concerned. They are simplified but they remain there, as Senator Xenophon just pointed out.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                             So that is it—this is a defining issue. I put it to my fellow senators: are we really going to obstruct the government on an issue on which the people clearly backed this government, to the point where another election may be forced later this year? Let me counsel members thinking about that to go down that road and think about the consequences. It would be unfair to the Australian people, who have made a judgment on this. It would not be responsible as far as electoral politics are concerned. Sure, if this was new, if this was an issue that had not been canvassed, if this government had been elected on other matters and were suddenly bringing this in here—like the Howard government was elected on other matters and brought Work Choices in here—the people might judge that badly at the next election. But I can tell you what will happen at the next election if this becomes a stumbling block: the people will judge those who made it a stumbling block—and the Senate is the clear arbiter on this matter—very badly indeed. Like my colleagues, I could go into the minutiae—and they are important—about these numbers. But, ultimately, the people have voted on this matter, and I do not think the Senate should defy the people’s judgment. That would be very unwise. So my counsel is that, while the argument is being put forward to change the numbers, the Senate think about this and accept the judgment of the people in 2007—or face the ire of the people in 2009. That is what we are really debating here.
                                                                            </p>

But I ask that particularly of the opposition—you were punished over Work Choices. You were punished over this Senate being turned into a failure of a watchdog—

As Santayana said, if you do not learn from history then history will punish you. That is my counsel—you can take it or leave it. We are arbiters of this matter, ultimately. There are good arguments for 20; there are good arguments for 25. When Work Choices was being debated in here, it was 50; it was 100 when it was being formulated. But the people accepted 15. It is part of a suite of measures that the people accepted, and I would counsel that we take their judgment on the matter.

My submission is it will be completely unworkable. It will be at the margin where the most pain will come, because employers will not be able to say, ‘Jane, Bob, Joe—I have got full-time, part-time and systematic casuals in place.’ They will have to be able to work out what full-time equivalence will be. And that will depend on what business cycle they are in; what seasonal business they are in, if it is seasonal; what period of the month it is; and whether it is over Christmas or

That is unlike the position that I think the opposition argued—that it was exempt, that it was outside.
                                                                                      </p>

We campaigned up hill and down dale on it. The position we put was crystal clear to the electorate. It was crystal clear what we were going to do when we got into office. I am fortunate enough to be in the position here today arguing for that, and I am not going to let it go without knowing in my heart that I have said everything that I could possibly say to make this happen.

We argued against 100 employees being exempt from the system. We argued for our policy and it was clear. We put more detail in our platform and in the policies that we took to the election than you would expect. We put in the detail of what we would actually do, and I am here now doing just that. What you argue is that outside the industrial relations arena you might know better. You might know that the ombudsman from the telecommunications industry might have a different measure. You argue that there might be a more practical measure somewhere else. I am arguing from the industrial relations framework that has existed in this country for many years. It has used 15. It has used full-time employees and it has used part-time employees and it has used systematic casual employees. Why? Because they know what the terms mean as they have dealt with them over the years. The

You will provide uncertainty to small business in this area, particularly small business at the margin. That is what you will do, and if I can argue you out of it in this chamber then I will do everything that I possibly can to convince you as to the right position to adopt. That is the position that we have put forward in our bill, not only because it is what we took to the election but also because it is simple, it is fair and it works. It has worked, because we know that the commission have used these terms before. They know what they mean and they can engage small business. Small business will be able to work with them—because, unlike Senator Boyce, I think that small business in this country is clever. It does work hard and it will be able to use these laws to ensure that it can dismiss people when it needs to and it can employ people when it needs to, and it will go on being profitable in this country.

It will be difficult to ensure that we have a certain position for small business. What I have learnt over many years from small business, having dealt with small business from a range of places—from both the Public Service and the union movement—is that they want certainty in their life: certainty about what the industrial relations laws are, certainty about what the tax laws are and certainty about a whole raft of legislation. So they argue for certainty. Why? Because if it is certain they do not have to considerate it, they do not have to think about it, they know what the rule is and they operate under it.

They say that, if the occasion arises when a small business employer wants to dismiss someone and is concerned that it could be construed as unfair dismissal, they should be advised to contact Fair Work Australia before taking the action and it is unlikely to be too onerous to add up the hours of work of various employees in terms of full-time equivalence. I am just putting simply what the peak body for small businesses in this country has said. I restate my position that it is a concern where there is a lack of confidence by small businesses in dealing with these claims. If that is an impediment to taking on a few extra workers, that is a real concern to me. But, again, we do have that fundamental protection of the fair dismissal code, which will contrast significantly with

I find it interesting that Senator Collins may have brought in the mascot for the Labor Party, called a goose I think. I don’t know whether it is your mascot, but that just shows how seriously you are treating this debate.

I agree with the Labor Party that the small business people are clever; they are not dumb. I also believe that workers are clever and are not dumb. When you think about it the Australian public are also quite smart. Maybe what the minister should do tonight is tell this chamber how he is going to go to the public with a double dissolution around the number 15. Tell us how you are going to do that. Are you sure that when the Australian public voted at the last election they were voting for 15 employees as a definition of small business?

A government has a mandate but the Senate also has a mandate to review and scrutinise. So you just cannot say that it was 15 and we had it as a policy going through the election. The Australian public did not vote for you for that. We all voted on a couple of issues in the last election, one was

When this bill gets passed in this chamber, in whatever shape or form, it will send a signal that Work Choices has gone. But we need to make sure that we actually use the proper process. You cannot circumvent it. You cannot try to take shortcuts. That is when you get problems. That is what happened last time when there was a majority held by one party in the Senate. There was the lack of scrutiny and lack of genuine debate going back and forward. It is good that we can have these debates—15, 20, 25, effective full-time; these are important issues we must get right.

We have to get the balance right with this particular legislation that impacts on all Australians in some way. These are the workplace laws for this country and we should make sure that the Senate does its job by scrutinising what the government puts forward. It is extremely important and we should all have a very high regard for that.

The government has already set as a principle that small businesses should be treated differently under the Fair Work Bill. That principle has been applied because they know that small businesses actually need to be treated differently. Family First is seeking to extend the treatment of small businesses as being different to other businesses through the right of entry.

There is Fair Work Australia. These are statutory bodies that have powers to investigate breaches of the workplace—and quite rightly so.
                                                                                               </p>

We think it needs to be an accountable statutory body, like the Workplace Ombudsman and Fair Work Australia. They have those powers and they are accountable as statutory bodies. I must say here that I am not against workers, I am not against unions and I am not against businesses. But with the Fair Work Bill we need to get the power balance right between workers, businesses and unions. We had a similar debate about getting the balance right with

Now we are faced with new industrial relations laws for this country, we need to look at the balance of power and get it shared. Too much power with any one of those three groups means that, all of a sudden, one can take advantage of the other.

We want to extend special treatment to small businesses with regard to right of entry for workplace contraventions. This is not about people in a union not having access to the union. They can still have that access and have the union work through their issues with them. But, at the end of the day, do we actually want to have entrench the unions as the next lot of police on the workplace? There could be some argument that that power is already there. But what we are discussing are whole new workplace laws for Australia and they have to be considered in their totality. Workers can no longer be ripped off like they could under Work Choices because of the National Employment Standards and the awards. It is good that they have the National Employment Standards and awards and that those awards are being modernised, so workers have those protections.

If they are not sure, they can go and consult a union, if they are a member, and discuss the issue with them. But, at the end of the day, it should be reported to a statutory body or authority because that is the right place—we can hold them to account. As I said, I am not against unions, but they are not accountable to anyone other than themselves. I cannot call them in to Senate estimates. They are not accountable to parliament. Statutory bodies are, and they have the powers to go and inspect certain things relating to non-union members.

                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                               </p>
                                                                                               <p>

I would say that, if you go down to your local shopping strip or other small businesses and ask them if they really want the unions to be entrenched as the police force for workplace contraventions, their answer will be no.

First of all, in relation to exempting small business, can I say to Senator Fielding—and I forewarned him I would be saying this—that it is somewhat passing strange that you would vote against a clause that would allow small business to claim conscientious objection, that you would say that should not be allowed, but then say, ‘No small business should be subjected to a union right of entry.’ I confess I do not get it. I want to place that on the record. I do not want to revisit the debate that we had—whenever it was; it seems a long time ago but it was yesterday. But, quite frankly, I remember that when I was in student politics and railed against compulsory student unionism, the first concession that was made was to say, ‘Well, all right, we’ll at least provide conscientious objection.’ That was seen as a concession along the road. So I cannot see why you would vote against that concession if you then say, ‘No union should be allowed into a small business.’ I have made that point. Draw a line under that; move on.

But, interestingly in saying that we had gone too far, Senator Fielding now puts in amendments that go further than we even did. So I confess I do not quite understand the thread of logic that is going through

                                                                                                  </p>

That is why, for example, we did believe in conscientious objection just as a little restraint in one area, which Senator Fielding voted down. But to say there should be no right of entry at all we say basically goes too far, and then to require that there be 72 hours notice as opposed to what is in the current law, which we legislated, namely 24 hours, we think is the right measure. What it highlights and again using that test that I have applied throughout this: if it is going to be anti small business and allow excessive union power, then we would be very negative to whatever the proposition might be.
                                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                                   But in relation to these two amendments, if the appropriate restrictions are put on at a later time—and we will be going through that—can I compliment the government on the considerable movement they have made with their proposed amendments in relation to right-of-entry provisions. I think that was to save Ms Gillard from having to sell her mother by that backtracking, but we do welcome those changes. Given the regime that I think will come out of the Senate at the end of this discussion, there will be the appropriate checks and balances that do provide the trade union movement with the opportunity to undertake a role that it has traditionally undertaken but within appropriate parameters. I think Senator Fielding’s two amendments would hogtie the unions too much. In this place you hardly ever hear me say that, because the propositions being put up by us we always think are fair and reasonable and the Labor Party usually go in the opposite direction to give more power to the unions. But on this occasion I have to say to Senator Fielding that we as a coalition believe that it does hogtie the unions too much. Therefore, we are minded to oppose those two amendments.

This still amounts to a fundamental breach of the right of freedom of association. If an employee is a member of a union they should be able to enjoy the benefits of that membership, and that includes the legitimate role of a union in enforcing their members’ entitlements.

Let me be very clear: we will be not be supporting any of these amendments.

There has never been a small business exemption from right-of-entry laws. Small business employees should have the same access to their unions as employees of large businesses. Any attempt to exclude small businesses from the right-of-entry laws would be contrary to the spirit of freedom of association principles and would go even further, as I said, than Work Choices in restricting union access.
                                                                                                            </p>

Work Choices required 24 hours notice. The government considers the existing 24-hour notice period to be sufficient for an employer to prepare for a visit from a permit holder. It strikes the right balance amongst business concerns, freedom of association and ensuring that employees are able to access their union representatives. I will not add any further to this debate; I think it is quite clear that these amendments are not supported by the government. They go too far. They do not strike the right balance and, in fact, deprive many employees of fair access to their union.

                                                                                                               In moving this amendment, the opposition believes that there should be some further provision in the right of entry in relation to holding discussions. Subclause (1) in our amended clause 484 is a mirror image of that which is in the bill, but we make it subject to subsections (2) and (3), which are the new parts of clause 484. We are saying that if each person mentioned in subsection 1 is a member of the permit holders’ organisation—in other words, if they are trade union members—the situation in subparagraph (1) is deemed to be satisfied. That puts that beyond doubt. We then say that if any of the persons mentioned in subparagraph (1) are not members of the permit holders’ organisation—in other words, if they are not a union member—the union official must not enter the premises for the purposes of holding discussions with such persons and must not hold discussions with such persons if otherwise authorised to enter the premises. This is unless they have the written permission of the occupier of the premises to do so, the majority of persons who perform work on the premises agree that the permit holder may do so or the permit holder obtains a majority support entry determination.
                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                               We then move on to go through how that majority support entry determination might be obtained. That would be by virtue of a determination by Fair Work Australia. If there is some dispute about what the majority of the workers want in that particular workplace, that matter could be resolved by Fair Work Australia. As I have been saying throughout this debate, the issue from our point of view is about excessive union power and how that might interact. We believe that there would be excessive union power if the clause as currently printed stands. We believe there should be a limit. We believe it is a modest limit. Basically, if the employer does not want the entry, or the majority of people who work on the premises agree that the union should not be on the premises, that should be the end of the matter. We believe that that is both fair to the employer and democratic for the workforce. If a majority of workers vote for it, they can have that visitation by the union official. I commend the amendment to the Senate.

We never restricted non-union members from talking to a union. I am trying to work out why Senator Abetz would go a step further than the Family First amendment when he says that Family First went too far. You are stopping non-union members talking to a union. We were stopping unions being the policemen, but you have gone a step further. That does not make sense to me at all.

They add a layer of complexity that does not exist in either Work Choices or the Forward with Fairness bill. Any measure which requires majority support in the workplace before a union could enter to talk to employees would result in minority groups of employees being disenfranchised and would be likely to breach international obligations in relation to freedom of association.

It is about a proposal to allow employees to decide—the opposition says democratically—if they want a union representative to meet with them in the workplace, and which union that ought to be, before entry can occur. I am not sure what motivates the opposition to think that they can add their own style of democracy to this provision. It is much easier to allow the provision as it stands, and as it continued on, to be the relevant provision—that is, you can have entry for discussion but you have to give 24-hours notice. That is sensible. It is sensible to ensure that the current provision is reflected, which is what the Fair Work Bill contains.

I think that is quite reasonable. No employee is forced to go to the lunch room or the room that is designated to meet with the union officials. I think the government’s position is reasonable, and I do not think this amendment is reasonable.

But, in circumstances where subclause (3)—‘if any of the persons’—applied, that would, in effect, mean that, for that particular category of people, if there are no union members then it would be a vote of the majority of the workers. We have already clarified in subclause (2) that for each person mentioned in subclause (1) that is a member of the permit holder’s organisation then their right of entry is assumed. What we are dealing with is a situation where there are no people who are actually members of the union. One of the difficulties that have been encountered is where a union asserts that it may have the right of entry because they have the capacity to represent somebody ‘whose industrial interests the permit holder’s organisation is entitled to represent’.
                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                      Those of us who were at the hearings heard that, for some workers, that might be a multiplicity of unions. In fact, one of the union officials said that they have about 27 pages of rules determining whether or not somebody can be a member of their union. In those circumstances, you could potentially have a rolling number of entries for the same employees. What we are saying is that, where you do not have union members, either the employer says yes or the majority of workers can indicate that they are interested. Of course, in this day and age of communications, if somebody does want to communicate with a union, it is not that hard to look up the phone number and make contact outside of work hours and meet them after work or at lunchtime et cetera. This is about coming into the workplace and the potential for the associated intimidation that goes along with that. Once again, we are talking about, if I might say, those circumstances where union officials are not behaving as one would expect and hope a union official would behave. That is why you have to have these sorts of clauses. We do know of examples; indeed, we just had one on, I think, page 2 of today’s

The issue is unions accessing the confidential information of non-union employees that would see a breach of people’s privacy. I know that you can debate this until the cows come home, so we could be here all day, but I still think that unions should not be accessing the records of non-union members. Someone else should authorise that and I believe that Fair Work Australia is the impartial body that should be arbiter of whether or not this should occur. The amendments are basically along the lines that there should not be unfettered access and that Fair Work Australia should adjudicate before any access to the records of non-union members. I will leave it there.

We believe that access should not be provided to employees’ records. The fact that Ms Gillard tried to get away with this is, we believe, not a good reflection on her. But somebody clearly must have mugged her with the reality that the Australian community, with its sense of a fair go, would not accept the sort of regime that was originally proposed in the bill—especially, might I add, in circumstances in which Ms Gillard made a very strong promise to the Australian people before the election.

On 28 August, the Labor Party said, ‘Labor will maintain the existing right of entry provisions. Right-of-entry rules remain.’ It made similar commitments the same day. Interestingly, even after the election, on 28 May, speaking to the Master Builders Australia dinner, Minister Gillard said:
                                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                                            </p>

You’d better wind back this right of entry nonsense and allow me to enjoy my life.’ Ms Gillard has wound it back and we congratulate the government. Whatever the motivation was, having had a very consistent line over many years on the right to privacy, we welcome the change and place on the record that those people who make a decision not to join a union now have their right to privacy protected.

A non-member’s record would be defined as a record that relates to the employment of a person who is not a member of the union. The amendments also provide that a permit holder will not be able to require access to non-member records. A permit holder will be able to seek an order from FWA giving them access to non-member records. FWA will be able to grant such an order only if it is satisfied that access is necessary to investigate a suspected breach relating to a member. And I note that the opposition have indicated that they are not minded to support

As it stands, union officials can only access relevant records and face civil penalties and lose their permit if they misuse their rights. We believe that this is sufficient protection and we do not need further

In that report they also went on to request the government to indicate measures taken to amend the legislation ‘to lift the restrictive conditions set out for granting a permit giving right of entry to the workplace, and ensure that the group of workers with whom a trade union representative may meet at the workplace is not artificially restricted’. The conditions the ILO wanted lifted have been kept in the bill at clause 513. We have some strong concerns about that. We keep hearing that we are moving away from

The Work Choices provisions operated to essentially deny workers freedom of association. During the committee inquiry we heard extensively about where employees had been forced to meet—under camera surveillance, in an office next door to the boss, in the tearoom and, in one instance we heard of, in the toilet.
                                                                                                                                      </p>

Again, during the inquiry we heard stories about the routes union representatives were forced to take to get to meetings. There was a lot of concern raised about that. We think it is reasonable to extend those provisions to include the route the union representative must take.
                                                                                                                                      </p>

State laws are state laws and should be regulated by state authorities. We see this as a hangover from Work Choices, and yet another unwarranted extension of jurisdiction.
                                                                                                                                      </p>

The bill currently allows permit holders to enter workplaces to investigate a suspected breach of entitlement if the breach relates to a member of the permit holder’s organisation and a member works on those premises. Permit holders must provide at least 24 hours notice of their entry. These requirements may make it difficult for unions who represent TCF outworkers to investigate whether these workers are receiving their lawful entitlements. Firstly, these vulnerable workers may not be union members or may be fearful of being identified as such. Secondly, the nature of outwork itself means that an outworker does not work at an employer’s premises. Thirdly, providing 24 hours notice may result in evidence being destroyed or the employer attempting to prevent the union from investigating premises where there were alleged breaches.

These amendments enable a permit holder from a union which is entitled to represent outworkers to enter premises, irrespective of whether a union member is present. In addition, the permit holder would be able to enter other premises where documents that were directly relevant to the breach may be kept. This reflects the fact that relevant documents are often kept at different premises from where the work is done.

These are certain terms in modern awards that impose particular obligations in relation to the use of outworkers. The TCF award creates a regulatory framework that applies to employees and entities that arrange for work to be carried out by outworkers, and unions do have a role in monitoring compliance with these obligations under the award.

I can indicate that we in the opposition support amendments (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (30), (32), (33), (35) and (44). I think it has already been indicated that Senator Xenophon has a certain attitude in relation to all the amendments. Therefore I would not seek to delay the chamber for too long, in explaining why the opposition has certain views on other of the amendments, if Senator Fielding were to be so minded as Senator Xenophon. But, whilst we give him the opportunity to return to the chamber—and I fully accept that there would be reasons why he had to leave the chamber, so that is not a reflection on him at all—I will say this to any judicial officer in this country in the event that they ever have to interpret item 10 of the amendments. These days, I understand, judicial officers or the judiciary cast far and wide to assist them in interpretation, but what I would invite them not to do is to go to Senate practice to determine how to interpret the term ‘directly relevant’. In sessional orders we now have the term ‘directly relevant’, which ministers are required to be during question time. If judicial officers were to see the practice in the Senate and say, ‘Yep, this is how we get to understand what “directly relevant” means,’ I think it would give very wide powers in relation to this particular clause. So, in the event any judge, in trying to determine how to interpret this, happens to read the

We believe that the right-of-entry restrictions in relation to the general framework are appropriate and we do not support these extra powers. We do understand the difficult and different circumstances in the TCF outworkers section. Coalition committee members had certain recommendations and submissions put to us from those engaged in that sector and they did make a good and powerful case. Yet I do say that, on balance, we are minded not to support all those other changes that were not included in the list of those that I indicated we support. The reason I read out the list of those that we support is that that is a substantially shorter list, but we would not seek to delay the chamber or divide on it unless there was an indication that Senator Fielding was minded to support us in that.

If you look at what the right of entry is supposed to do, it is to enable investigation of potential breaches. As for the outworkers provision, if you give the fly-by-night operators, the sweatshops—to use that term—or the backyard operators 24 hours notice, there will be nothing to see, nothing to investigate, no books and no records. That is why I think it is fundamentally important that, if we look at some of the most exploited and vulnerable workers, those TCF outworkers, there be an opportunity for a right of entry that is not contingent upon 24 hours notice. So I believe that is a fundamental improvement.

I commend that to my colleagues, although I do not think I need to convince my colleagues in the Greens about those particular provisions. I think we have got an improved set of provisions in relation to the right of entry, taking into account the privacy considerations as set out by the Privacy Commissioner in the inquiry process, which was a very useful exercise. So I am hoping that this set of amendments will be passed.

We do not think they go far enough in respect to sweatshops, although we acknowledge that the amendment that Senator Xenophon has managed to persuade the government on is a step in the right direction. As we said in our minority report, we think parliament must use the opportunity presented by this bill to get regulation of the

It has been an ongoing issue and I know that generally there has been cross-party recognition of the issues around the TCF industry and outworkers. We believe that parliament has acknowledged there do need to be special protections for these vulnerable workers. As I said earlier we are not satisfied the government amendments do what they need to do to ensure adequate protection of TCF outworkers and sweatshop workers.

Unions must have the capacity to exercise appropriate right of entry in relation to outworkers and people working in sweatshops. We are particularly pleased to see in the revised sheet at amendments (21) to (23) that the government has removed, as Senator Xenophon has just said, the requirement for 24 hours notice for entry relating to TCF workers. The committee heard, again as Senator Xenophon articulated, a great deal of evidence about how the 24 hours notice requirement was inappropriate for TCF workers, where the setup can be very mobile and a notice period can often lead to a sweatshop no longer existing in the same place. However we are not convinced the government’s amendments adequately address the recommendations of the majority Senate report in relation to TCF workers. We put the government on notice that we will be keeping a very close eye on whether they do in fact move to address all the issues that were raised in the majority report, particularly in relation to sweatshops, and we expect to see all these outstanding issues resolved.

However, again, we are not convinced that the amendments passed were, in fact, adequate and we are concerned to ensure that all relevant award conditions are protected. Similarly to the right of entry provisions, we will be keeping a close eye on the government to make sure all these outstanding issues are resolved. I would particularly like to mention and thank Asian Women at Work for the excellent evidence that they gave to the inquiry. I think that the issues they raised were particularly important and they gave very clear examples of why these sorts of provisions are absolutely essential. I indicate that the Greens will be supporting these amendments.

Some of the stories that we heard through the committee process cause concern. The question here though is one of balancing out power and how far it goes, and I am torn between both. I think in the end I am not going to support these amendments because I am worried about the power going too far with the unions. Maybe there is another way to solve this; I do not know. But I do know that tonight I feel uncomfortable with some of the powers here. I will probably have further discussions on this, but at this stage I do not feel comfortable supporting the amendments and I also feel uncomfortable knowing some of the stories that we heard through the committee process.

Senator Fielding indicated that he was concerned with some of the stories that he heard during the inquiry, and he should be. He should be concerned because this is an industry where there is massive exploitation. This Senate has looked at this issue over the last 20 years. There have been Senate inquiries, there has been legislation and there has been a lot of bipartisan work done by this Senate to try to address the exploitation that happens in this industry. But it has not worked. What we have done in the Senate up until now has not been enough. It is not because of a lack of effort from those who try to implement the basic fundamental laws that give these people protection from the exploitation. It is not through lack of effort; it is through a lack of legislation. It is through a lack of ability to rid this country of this severe exploitation and of those who wish to exploit this type of work.
                                                                                                                                                     </p>

This is the only work many of these people can get, and the nature of this industry allows them to be exploited. We have a responsibility and an obligation as legislators to legislate to have a practical effect to end that exploitation. We can argue about the powers and whether they go too far. In the normal sense of things, that is the proper political debate that we have in this place, but when we know that there is exploitation going on, and that is not disputed, we have an obligation to fix it. If we have to go further in this particular industry than we do for any other industry, we should do so.

I am hopeful that these amendments, as a lot, will take us a large step forward in ending the exploitation which has been well known and well documented by the Senate. We have tried to legislate in a bipartisan way before to get a good result, but it has not been enough. We have to take the extra step, we have to go further, because I do not want the Asian Women at Work group, Fair Work Australia and all the people who have constantly come to the Senate committee process and told us their stories, inquiry after inquiry after inquiry, to keep coming back, telling us their stories and asking us why we have not been able to fix the problem.

You have met those people—you know how dedicated they were. It is because there is a lack of legislation and a lack of power to give those people the right to do those investigations, the right to just give those people the most basic, minimum standards. That is what we need to do. I ask you, Senator Fielding: reconsider and support the whole tranche of the government’s amendments.

The concerns that he and others had with respect to privacy, I think, have been fundamentally addressed—and I commend him for that—without in any way, I believe, undermining the integrity or the intention of the right of entry provisions. Now, generally, there will have to be 24 hours notice, and there are safeguards in getting the permit in the first place. You have to give the reason why you are going in and, also, Fair Work Australia has a supervisory role in relation to all this—the decision can be contested. But there is a fundamental difference. The point has just been made very well by my colleague: this particular industry is an exception. It is not like any other type of industry. We are not talking about premises where there is a sign out the front, where there is a registered office or where, for the purpose of the Income Tax Act and the Corporations Law, the liability is attached to a particular address. These are backyard operators; these are operators where there is no safety net. These are operators who can just pack up and go elsewhere with literally a few hours notice.
                                                                                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                                                                                       Senator Marshall talked about effectiveness and made a very good point: what is the point of passing a law unless it is going to have some teeth and be effective? I know that Senator Fielding, in his advocacy for the vulnerable in the community, has a genuine concern for people—families—who are vulnerable. This particular amendment will make it effective. There are still safeguards in the legislation with respect to being required to obtain a permit or being required to reasonably suspect that the contravention has occurred or is occurring. If it is abused, then there are inbuilt sanctions with Fair Work Australia. But, if we want to tackle the evil of exploitation of outworkers by backyard operators and sweatshops, then this is an important and fundamental reform in order to do it. With the greatest respect, I urge Senator Fielding to consider this and give this a go because it is an important reform in relation to some of the most vulnerable and exploited workers in the community.

I may not agree with Senator Xenophon on all issues, but on this issue I do. It is an area where you do need special provisions to ensure that the legislation works effectively. To achieve that, you rebalance the scales. You cannot take what you might consider to be reasonable circumstances and apply them across the board because in this industry we know from long experience, from advice and from being told not only by employees but by the TCF industry unions themselves that employers in this area are not the best. They accept that these types of special powers are required to address some of the circumstances that vulnerable people will find themselves in.
                                                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                                                           That is the critical issue. It is about whether you accept that those people who are vulnerable in our society, the families that do the outwork—who are trying to do their best to find income and send their kids to school—deserve special measures. Our submission is that they do. We agree with Senator Xenophon that they do. It is about ensuring that they can provide for their families and their kids. It is about ensuring that the income they earn is reasonable for the work they do. In other words, it is a fair go for them too, because we know from long experience that they do not always get a fair go. That is not to condemn all outwork employers, but we know that at the bottom end of that market some very awful practices go on. For those areas we think the powers should be weighted a little bit more towards protection. This measure does not go as far as some might want it to go. What it does do is try to address the circumstances which TCF outworkers might find themselves in and try to bring those back a little and provide some fairness.

I suspect they think that some of them go too far and are weighted more towards the employee than the employer. But I think Senator Xenophon has demonstrated in the debate tonight that he understands where the balance lies, and I would ask

TCF workers are our most vulnerable workers. In the past there have been some differences of opinion, but, as I said when I first addressed these amendments, there has genuinely been really strong cross-party support for strong and fair TCF amendments. During the Senate inquiry the submissions contained story after story of abuses of outworkers. Progressively in Australia we have tightened our laws to offer protections to our most vulnerable workers.
                                                                                                                                                           </p>

These are the workers that are most easily exploited because, as Senator Xenophon, Senator Ludwig and I have articulated, the sweatshops in particular are so easy to move. It is very hard to pin them down. During the inquiry process we heard stories that they do not even keep proper records of their employees or of the work that is done, so it is very hard to tell if the workers are being paid properly. The experience of a number of years has shown that, as a Senator Ludwig said, we need special protection for these workers. These provisions and this type of approach have developed over the years to ensure that we do give the best protection possible to these our most vulnerable workers.
                                                                                                                                                           </p>

They do not know what protections they have under Australian laws. They are easily exploited. Often, they have families to support and they are new arrivals in Australia. As I said, they do not necessarily understand the provisions or protections in our laws, and often they do not know who to go to for help. The committee heard incredible stories about some of the treatment they receive from their bosses. Senator Marshall will confirm the stories we were told about how some of these workers are treated. It is simply outrageous. As I said, they are the easiest to exploit. They are our most vulnerable workers. It is essential that we protect them.

I seriously urge Senator Fielding to have another think about these amendments. They are the least that we can do to offer protections to these most vulnerable workers. If we do not pass them we will be condemning TCF workers and outworkers to exploitation, and of course that means their families are also affected. It is essential that we protect these workers and their families.

She was a clothing worker and told us how she and her daughter suffered because she was not getting adequate pay and was being required to make up pieces in totally unrealistic time frames. When she could not make those time frames she was being penalised. She and her daughter were essentially living in one room while she was trying to meet that totally unacceptable workload and was being unfairly treated. I cannot believe that in 2009 we do not think these amendments are absolutely essential to provide protection for TCF workers and for outworkers. I urge the coalition and Senator Fielding to please reconsider and support these amendments.
