        Before I move general business notice of motion No. 652, I seek leave to amend the return date by one additional sitting day, to Wednesday 17 June.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I, and also on behalf of Senator Rice, move the motion as amended:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thatâ€”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) There be laid on the table by Wednesday, 17 June 2020, by the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) any evaluation against Community Development Grant program criteria prepared by the Department in relation to any successful recipients identified during or after the 2019 election; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) a list of all projects that have been identified by government as potential recipients prior to the 2019 election campaign, but have not yet been contracted or commenced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) In the event the Minister fails to table the documents requested in paragraph (1), the Senate requires the Minister to attend the Senate by 10am on 18 June 2020 to provide an explanation, of no more than 10 minutes, of the Government's failure to table the documents requested.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Any senator may move to take note of the explanation required by paragraph (2).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Any motion under paragraph (3) shall have precedence over all business until determined, and senators may speak to the motion for not more than 10 minutes each.

          The question is that paragraph (1) of general business notice of motion No. 652, standing in the names of Senators Waters and Rice, be agreed to.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question agreed to.
         </p>
         <p>
          Before we put this to a formal vote, I'll just advise the Senate on dates. We split this motion into paragraph (1), which we voted on, and then the rest of the motion, which is paragraphs (2), (3) and (4). In paragraph (1), you will recall that Senator Waters sought an amendment to change the date from 16 June to 17 June. That then required a change of date in paragraph (2), from 17 June to 18 June. So, with the concurrence of the Senate, we will put the motion that way. The question is that paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of general business notice of motion No. 652 as amended, standing in the names of Senators Waters and Rice, be agreed to.
