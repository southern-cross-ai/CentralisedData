        When I gave my first speech the other day I spoke of my happy upbringing and my time at my parents' property at Cliffy, as well as the land that we had. We had Heddon Greta Speedway across the road and a drive-in just a kilometre or two down the road. With the energy of youth, life was great, and all of those locations were visited more than once. I walked the speedway track and imagined myself racing around it. But the speedway closed long ago, and the track turned into housing, because change happens and change is inevitable.

        Today it has been advised that the director is about to call cut on the other local icon, the Heddon Greta Drive-In. It has survived bushfires, floods and global pandemics, with its facilities used for COVID testing at the virus's peak, but it cannot beat change. It cannot fight time, and notice has been given that the metaphorical curtains will be closing, with a development application for more housing to be lodged. Whilst the facility has been around since before my recollection, it most recently came to life under Scott Sneddon, who reopened the turnstiles in 1996 with a double feature of
        <i>
         Babe
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         Apollo 13
        </i>
        . Since that evening in March, it reintroduced itself as a cornerstone of local entertainment amongst those with a strong car culture in the

        . With the iconic advertising slogan of 'If you don't like the movie you can slash your seats,' young lovers, families that couldn't be bothered dressing up to go out and groups of friends all attended. It was more than a movie; it was an event. There was no more jumping into boots or burying kids under blankets to dodge a ticket, as we paid per car and had a ball. Thank you, Scottie, for bringing this back into our lives. Good luck in your development and good luck in finding a site for a proposal to construct the new facility.
