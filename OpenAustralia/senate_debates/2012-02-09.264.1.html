        <p>
         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) By 1 November 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Six persons where identified on the webpage. One of those members has discharged from Army and another is in the Standby Reserves. Three of the members remain in units that contain members of Army who were identified in the investigation. Those three members have indicated a desire for this to occur. One member has identified a desire not to be directly involved with members identified in the investigation. That individual is currently in a workplace that allows this separation to be managed.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Army conducted cultural training sessions for staff on 31 May 2011 that highlighted the significance of privacy settings in social media. Army also wrote to the 32 ADF members identified in the investigation and made a similar point.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) There is no list of words and expressions that are explicitly prohibited from being used by Defence members. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force_Discipline_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force Discipline Act
         </a>
         1982 (DFDA), however, provides for the discipline of members engaged in unacceptable behaviour. Additionally, members of the ADF remain subject to state and Commonwealth laws (see response to parts 4-7 of Senate Question on Notice No. 1473).
