         Thank you so much, Senator Brockman, for your question. I am really looking forward to staying up late and watching our athletes in action, as I know everyone in this chamber will be. Australia will be represented by 51 outstanding athletes at the

          Winter Olympics
         </a>
         commencing tomorrow in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          South Korea
         </a>
         . The Australian team are already amongst the best in the world. Australia was fifth on the medal tally at the Freestyle Ski and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding_World_Championships" rel="nofollow">
          Snowboarding World Championships

         in Spain last year, claiming five medals. Despite being one of the driest nations, we have great representation at the Winter Olympics. We are a nation of just 27 million people but, when it comes to international sport, we certainly achieve beyond expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our athletes are supported by the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the Australian Sports Commission's annual investment of $5.5 million. Last year, the Sports Commission provided a boost of $845,000 to give our athletes the best shot for these Winter

         </a>
         . And what a shot we have! We have emerging athletes competing in their first Olympic Games, such as Jessica Yeaton in cross-country skiing from the great state of WA. Senator Brockman, I know you will be staying up late to watch that event. There is Kailani Craine from Newcastle in figure skating, who I am sure Senator McAllister, Senator O'Neill, Senator Payne and all

         senators, because we know that sport unites, will be barracking on loudly. Reigning world champions Scotty James in the halfpipe and Britt Cox in mogul skiing are strong medal chances, as are our aerial skiers
