        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Can the minister advise the Senate whether the government intends to protect Australia from job losses in manufacturing industries, such as the cement industry, in its proposed new carbon tax arrangements?

             I also want to acknowledge that she is genuinely concerned about manufacturing, coming as she does from Victoria. It is a pity a few more on the other side do not display that level of interest. This government is committed to ensuring the prosperity of manufacturing in this country. We recognise the concerns of industry, and we also recognise the fact that there is an opportunity here to transform Australian industry in such a way as to ensure that jobs in Australia will grow.

               Jobs in Australia will continue to grow with a carbon price where there is incorporation of appropriate levels of assistance and co-investment. This government is determined to ensure that new jobs are created in new industries and that existing industries are able to be transformed to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Sustainability and carbon efficiency ought to be the touchstones of every business in this country, and we are ensuring that those opportunities are developed to ensure that that actually happens. The government is working to ensure that existing manufacturing jobs and important skills in new manufacturing industries are able to meet the challenges of a carbon constrained world.

              <p>
               A very good example of that is occurring in all sorts of industries, particularly in the automotive industry in Victoria where we are seeing already an industry transforming itself to meet the challenges of a carbon constrained world. This government is working with industry to ensure that we keep our manufacturers and the goods that they produce internationally competitive. We want to ensure that the carbon price—

                 The opposition is seeking to pretend that Australia is rushing ahead in the global fight against climate change. That is a bit like trying to claim that Australia won the Ashes. We have a situation where Australia is, in fact, falling behind in the race to develop clean technology solutions and clean energy solutions. Countries around the world are transforming their industries to the realities of the 21st century at a much faster rate than we are in this country.

                   Senator Troeth has misunderstood the nature of the scheme. What we have indicated is that every cent raised as a result of this scheme will be redistributed to assist this country adapt to a carbon constrained world, whether it be to households or industry. We are in the business of ensuring that Australian industry remains competitive and, by doing so, is able to transform itself in such a way as to be able to deal with the challenges that every business in this country has to face up to. It is foolish and incredibly short-sighted to believe that we can persist with business-as-usual approaches to the issues of climate change. What is required is for us to engage with business in such a way as to enable every firm in this country—every business, every enterprise in this country—to adjust to the circumstances that we are facing in the contemporary environment. That is exactly what this government is doing. We are engaging with manufacturers; we are engaging with all other aspects of the economy.
