        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, upon notice, on 16 July 2012:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With reference to the May 2010 Consultation Regulation Impact Statement on reducing emissions from non road spark ignition engines and equipment:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) What action regarding the regulation of emissions from non-road spark ignition engines and equipment has occurred since the regulation impact statement (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS" rel="nofollow">
         RIS
        </a>
        ) consultation period closed in July 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Was there to have been a ‘decision RIS’; if so, has this been completed and what has happened since; if not, why not.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Based on a cost benefit analysis of options to manage emissions from selected non road engines which was completed by McLennan Magasanik Associates in August 2008, is it reasonable to conclude that the delay: (a) to date has cost the health budget approximately $394 million; if not, can an estimate be provided; and (b) is costing the economy $67 million a year in fuel costs and producing more than 170 000 tonnes in carbon emissions every year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Is it correct that industry peak bodies, representing manufacturers of outdoor power equipment such as lawn mowers and marine outboard engines, have approached the Minister’s office on a number of occasions since 2009 seeking early implementation of small engine emissions standards that would bring Australia into line with standards already in place for up to 13 years in the United States of America, Europe, Japan, Canada, China and India.

        <p>
         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1. Emissions from non-road spark ignition engines are currently not regulated in Australia. Further work on this matter, since the the completion of the Consultation
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS" rel="nofollow">
          RIS
         </a>
         , has included additional consultation with stakeholders, especially those who did not make submissions as part of the RIS process. Consideration of this matter is continuing in the context of the development of the National Plan for Clean Air which is a strategic priority agreed to by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
          Council of Australian Governments
         </a>
         (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         ) for the work program of the Standing Council for Environment and Water.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2 .A decision regulation impact statement has not been completed. Consideration of regulation of emissions from non-road spark ignition engines and equipment is continuing under the National Plan for Clean Air, and progression of this matter has yet to be considered by the Standing Council for Environment and Water.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         3. Under COAG guidelines a robust assessment of the impacts of proposed regulations is required. The time required to complete a regulatory impact assessment process varies and is subject to a number of factors including the degree of analysis required and the complexity of the problem. The cost benefit analysis prepared in 2008 by McLennan Magasanik Associates provides economic modelling of net social benefits. These costs and benefits are expressed in money terms for the purpose of comparing policy options and cannot be directly compared to the current health budget. Analysis of the policy options has continued, taking into account submissions received on the consultation RIS.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         4. Industry organisations representing sections of the market have sought the introduction of emission standards. Key stakeholders have had the opportunity to inform this process, including through engagement with Ministers and their offices.
