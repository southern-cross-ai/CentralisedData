           A decision on the future location of the full cycle docking activities for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_class" rel="nofollow">
            Collins class
           </a>
           submarine sustainment has not yet been made. Our most important priority is to guarantee the ongoing availability of our nation's submarine capability throughout the transition from the Collins class submarines to the next fleet of 12 attack class submarines. This decision will be made by the government after careful consideration of all the relevant information and advice and on the basis of what is in our national interest. We will not decide this issue based on emotion in the Senate. Senator Patrick, in moving this motion, knows that no decision has been made in relation to the future full cycle docking arrangements. He also knows that the government, not the Senate, will ultimately make this decision. As we have made consistently clear, that decision will be made on the basis of what is in our national interest after proper consideration of all the relevant information and advice.

               Collins class
              </a>
              submarines, is a national strategic asset. The fact is that only the government has access to all the relevant advice from Defence and ASC to make an informed decision. Senator Reynolds promised to make a decision last year but singularly failed. She has left ASC workers in the lurch. We also encourage Senator Patrick to use his vote as much as his words. He's a crossbench vote. The government needs to pass legislation, but his support for government legislation is largely a foregone conclusion. This motion won't persuade the government to do anything if Senator Patrick won't back up his words with his vote.
