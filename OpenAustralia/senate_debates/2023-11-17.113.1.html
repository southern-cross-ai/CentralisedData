        As a servant to the many different people who make up our one Queensland community, I proudly advise the Senate that on the next sitting day I'll introduce One Nation's Customs Amendment (Preventing Child Labour) Bill 2023. There have been many attempts to ban products with child labour in their supply chainsâ€”all have failed. The reasons were always the same. Including adult slave labour and child labour in the same bill ensures failure. These are two different problems needing two different solutions. Adult slave labour is a contentious issue which has always failed on the definition of slave labour. It's best dealt with politically.

        , on the other hand, has a clear definition from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization" rel="nofollow">

        . If a child misses school, or would miss school if school were available, in order to engage in work, that's child labour.
       </p>
       <p>
        My bill imposes escalating penalties on products with child labour in their supply chain, leading eventually to a complete ban. This approach gives companies time to fix their supply chain, and it allows ethical companies time to ramp up production and meet increased demand. It gives offending suppliers time to move from employing children to instead employing adults from the same area. However, a knee-jerk solution to immediately ban products with child labour in their supply chain would be disastrous for the economies of the countries hosting industries currently using child labour. This is why governments in these countries have had little appetite to address the issue. These children would be in school and their parents in a job if it were not for rich Western countries looking the other way because everyone loves cheap electronics, clothing and coffee. I ask all senators for their support when the bill is brought to a vote early next year. I would welcome discussion with the minister on a government led solution.
