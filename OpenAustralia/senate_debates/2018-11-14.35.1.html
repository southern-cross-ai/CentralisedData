        ns. It's never too late to honour the great work of Australians and, indeed, I'm delighted to stand here this afternoon to recognise the outstanding achievement of Western Australians who were recently recognised by the Queen with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        honours that were announced on 11 June.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Order" rel="nofollow">
         The Order
        </a>
        of Australia was established in 1975 by the Queen. It is the principal and most prestigious means of recognising outstanding members of the Australian community. Each recipient must have contributed to our great society in one of the following ways: demonstrated achievement at high level, made a contribution over and above what might be reasonably expected through paid employment, or made a voluntary contribution to the community which stands out from other volunteers. To honour their contribution to our community, today in the chamber I'll read the names of each of those Western Australians that have been honoured and the citation.
