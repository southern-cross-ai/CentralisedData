         I thank Senator Fawcett for his question and his interest in student performance around Australia. Last week, the latest
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
          NAPLAN
         </a>
         results were released in relation to NAPLAN testing in 2017. They really did demonstrate a mixed bag of results. Around the country, we saw, for year-on-year results, marginal gains in relation to reading and numeracy skills, but a marginal decline in writing skills. In our home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , Senator Fawcett, we did see longer term trends that showed, in particular, improvements, as across the nation, in relation to the areas of reading and numeracy but particular declines in relation to writing skills.
        </p>
        <p>
         Overall, I'm sorry to say, across all measures in relation to the year-on-year results, our home state was the worst or second worst performing state in 16 out of the 20 different categories. Alarmingly, for the most significant negative shift, there was a five per cent decline in year 3 writing skills, which shows a significant impact and a concern in relation to future results. This, as Senator Fawcett and other senators would be well aware, comes on the back of 15 years of state Labor policies in South Australia, which are clearly failing hardworking teachers and principals, parents and students in terms of the outcomes that South Australia needs. South Australia clearly needs to look at some of the other states that have shown more positive results. In
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , there were positive gains in all categories;
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         has seen a strong gain over a long period of time. These are instances and demonstrations that policies in states can make a difference. What we must do is identify how the record funding to Australian schools is used most effectively and ensure it's being replicated right acrossâ€”

           Can the minister apprise the Senate of what the government is doing to support the states and territories and the non-government sector to ensure that the record funding that the Commonwealth is providing is being invested in ways which will actually lift student results?

We are pleased that a number of leading educationists, particularly those with grassroots, hands-on experience as principals and teachers, are joining with Mr Gonski in undertaking this work, which will ensure that, in a state like

               This government is the first government to seriously take the issue of how we get best bang for our buck from educational investment. Those opposite like to talk a lot about how much is spent, but the only plan we're aware of that they have is a plan to promise to spend more. They have a plan to promise to spend more, but they have no idea as to where that money would go, as to who they would give it to or as to how it would be usedâ€”they just have a promise to spend more. In addition to that promise to spend more, there is one other thing that we know: they have a promise to tax more as well.
