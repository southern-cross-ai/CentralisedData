             It would be remiss of me to let the opportunity pass without acknowledging, with thanks and appreciation, the role of Senator Marshall, the previous occupant of the position. Senator Marshall, you were an outstanding Deputy

              President of the Senate

             . You were respected by all government senators for your fairness, your even-handedness, your authority, your command of the standing orders and the willing spirit of cooperation which you enjoyed with the President of the Senate. There was never a breath of partisanship when you were in the chair. Senator Lines, you have big shoes to fill, which we are sure and confident that you will do.

               Sue West
              </a>
              , who held the deputy's position from 1997 to 2002. This chamber has increased the number of women by one, to 30 senators, since the end of the 44th Parliament, and I am particularly pleased that the opposition now has a woman holding the positions of leader, whip, deputy whips and Deputy President.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator Lines has previously served as a Temporary Chair of Committees. She entered the Senate following the retirement of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans" rel="nofollow">
               Chris Evans
              </a>
              in 2013 and has served on a number of standing committees, most notably as Chair of the Education and Employment References Committee. We are confident, on this side of the chamber, that Senator Lines will bring her experience and her personality to the important role of Deputy President and Chair of Committees.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also pay tribute to Senator Marshall. I thank him for his service as Deputy President since July 2014. He is someone with regard for the traditions and conventions of this chamber and was a fair and effective chair. I look forward to his future contribution to the opposition.
