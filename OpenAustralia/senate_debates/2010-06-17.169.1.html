        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Sherry. Minister, given that at last year’s G20 leaders meeting in Pittsburgh the Prime Minister committed to phase out subsidies to fossil fuels as a critical part of efforts to tackle climate change, and undertook by the next leaders meeting in Toronto—which is in nine days time—to set out the implementation plans for the phase-out, has the Australian government prepared a time line and implementation plans to phase out fossil fuel subsidies to meet this commitment? If so, what are those plans and when will they be released?

         Thank you, Senator Milne, for your question. The government supports the G20 commitment from the Pittsburgh summit to rationalise or phase out inefficient fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption. Australia’s response on this matter was finalised and submitted to the G20 on 11 June 2010 after the G20 finance ministers meeting in Busan in Korea, which the Treasurer, Mr Swan, attended some two weeks ago. The G20 energy experts group is compiling a report to leaders based on submissions from the G20 members. It is not appropriate for me today to pre-empt the processes. There is a meeting later this month, as I understand it, in Toronto. It is on 26 and 27 June. The government understands that the publication of the response of the G20 members to the commitment will be discussed at the forthcoming leaders summit in Toronto.
        </p>
        <p>
         Obviously, Australia will be outlining its position in detail at that meeting in Toronto. There will be, I am sure, very extensive discussion about the issue of the rationalising of fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption. So, with respect, Senator Milne, we have to be a little patient for a couple of weeks longer to see what the outcomes—

            I have a supplementary question,

             Mr President
            </a>
            . I ask the minister when he is going to table that report that Minister Swan gave to the Korean meeting. Can he also tell us what the government’s definition of a fossil fuel subsidy is and whether it will include such clear subsidies as the fuel tax credits and fringe benefits tax concession for motor vehicles, or is it the government’s intention to define direct subsidies just as those that reduce the price of fossil fuel, such as those used in developing countries?

            </small>
            <p>
             I think a fair number of the questions you asked there, and there were I think about eight or nine questions in that question, relate to the primary question, which I believe I have answered. As I have indicated, at that G20 meeting there was a commitment to remove inefficient fuel subsidies. I do not have the definition, if indeed one was adopted, of fuel subsidies that arose from that meeting of the G20. As I said, Senator Milne, certainly I would hope that there is significant progress that arises from the meeting in Toronto on 26 and 27 June.

              , I raise a point of order. We are mindful that there are five days of sitting before the winter break. Senator Milne clearly asked the minister to state when he would present the report given to other governments at Busan to the

                 and Sweden last week launched a Friends of Fossil-Fuel Subsidy Reform group to lobby the G20 leaders for more ambitious and transparent action on the promised fossil fuel subsidy phase-out, is Australia committed to transparency as well as ambition in this regard? If so, why won’t you tell Australians what you are proposing and have proposed already and give us a date as to when you are going to release it and what your definition of a fossil fuel subsidy is?

                  and Sweden, I am not familiar with the process, the definitions, the phase-out proposals of New Zealand and Sweden. I do not think that would surprise Senator Milne. Nevertheless, wanting to be helpful, I will take on notice and obtain the details of the New Zealand and Sweden phase-out proposals. I am not familiar with them. I will take that on notice, and let us hope for a positive outcome to the meeting in a couple of weeks.
