        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Will the minister outline for the Senate the reasons why it is important that the government’s inflation-fighting surplus is left intact?

         I thank the senator for what is a very important question. The Rudd Labor government’s first budget delivered on its election commitments. It delivered on the commitments it made to people in terms of tax cuts, child care, education tax rebate—every one of our election promises was delivered as part of our budget strategy. The Australian people appreciate and notice the difference. From 1 July a range of those measures, if passed by this Senate, will come in.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other commitment we made was to be fiscally conservative. The opposition attacked us, saying, ‘You couldn’t possibly be fiscally conservative—we cannot accept that.’ Despite the fact that we inherited a high inflation rate, despite the fact that we came in in a period when interest rate rise after interest rate rise had occurred under the previous government and despite the international uncertainty, we delivered a budget surplus of $22 billion. We said we needed a huge surplus in order to keep downward pressure on inflation, to keep downward pressure on interest rates. So we delivered on the things we said we would do during the election campaign—delivered on our commitments, delivered on our fiscal conservatism—to make this economy strong and to protect Australian families from inflation and interest rates.

           They do not like hearing it,

           . That strategy, endorsed by the Australian people, is under threat because the Liberal-National Party opposition will not pass our budget bills. They are seeking to undermine that surplus that is so critical to the economic conditions in Australia and so critical to families, pensioners and the whole community, who are relying on us keeping up a fight against inflation. This is economic vandalism, because they will not allow us to deliver the budget we want to deliver. Six months since the last election—six months since they had to learn to sit over that side—and the arrogance of the Liberal opposition continues. They will not accept the will of the people. The people said, ‘We elected a Rudd Labor government,’ and this government is delivering on its commitments and you are trying to prevent us delivering on our commitments.

              I am happy to do that at any stage—and the cheques will go out, provided you pass the budget! The cheques will go out to pensioners provided you pass the budget. I, like everyone else in Australia, have no idea what the Liberal Party’s real position is. It is so divided, so confused. I remember, just after the budget, the baby bonus was the problem, then it was the FTBB! Have you heard anything in the last month?

               I have not heard anything in the last month. Then it was all about luxury vehicles, ensuring that we do not tax luxury vehicles—apparently now that is the main cause of concern—or that we do not remove the excise exemption from condensate. And, of course, now they do not want us to give a tax cut to those paying the Medicare levy who are not in private health insurance—that is the current thing, although on the way in today someone told me they had decided to oppose our dental reforms as well. They are going to use their last gasp of a Senate majority to try and destroy the dental reforms as well. Quite frankly, the opposition’s credentials are in tatters. The great irony is that they are hiding behind process. They are saying, ‘We’ve got the numbers today, and we’re going to use our numbers to put off the decision till we don’t have the numbers.’ How politically courageous! How far have you fallen! You are going to delay your decision till you do not have the numbers. What political cowardice!

                    They do not like it because they know it is true. Political cowardice at its worst! You are handing the balance to the Greens on all these issues. You say that is the worst thing that could possibly happen, but you are going to vote to give them the power to make the decisions. You are political cowards!
