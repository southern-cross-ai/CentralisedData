        , Senator Watt. I refer to the recent High Court rulings which determined that successive Liberal and National party immigration and citizenship laws were unconstitutional. Given that the High Court struck down Mr Dutton's failed immigration and citizenship laws, what has the Albanese government done to keep the community safe since those decisions?

          For the second day in a row it would appear that members of the opposition don't like their own record being pointed out to them. Senator Walsh, I thank you for your question. Unlike how those opposite operated while they were in government, on this side of the Senate, we believe it is important to ensure laws that protect the community can actually operate, because it is not tough talk that keeps Australians safe; it is tough laws that stand up in court. We are leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to protect the community and we haven't wasted a single day in doing so. The Australian Border Force and the

          have been working hard to ensure community safety. The work they're doing is exceptional and I, for one—if not the opposition—thank them for their hard work.

            We continue our work to protect the Australian community. We have already introduced a range of steps including ankle bracelets, increased monitoring and curfews. We have provided additional support to our agencies, $255 million in total in extra support for these measures. We made it clear from the outset that we will consider options to strengthen laws further to protect Australia. We introduced a new bill to make strong laws stronger, a bill that the opposition voted against yesterday in the House of Representatives—for all their tough talk.
           </p>
           <p>
            We will work through the High Court's written reasons when they are handed down in a few minutes' time. Contrast this with the actions of some of those who sit in this chamber, because we see the opposition regularly say one thing and do another. The Leader of the Opposition talks tough on border but he slashed funding for compliance staff when he was the Minister for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
             Home Affairs
            </a>
            . Mr Dutton talks tough on crime but, under his watch, sexual exploitation of migrants, and organised crime and people trafficking skyrocketed. When we need leaders to protect people, Mr Dutton plays politics. This government sees the challenges in the world and is upfront with Australians about them. We don't play politics with national security or social cohesion and nor should the opposition. We won't repeat the mistakes made by the coalition in the past.

              Yesterday the Senate heard that for years Mr Dutton and his coalition colleagues talked tough on national security but didn't deliver while in government. Why is it important to take strong action to keep the community safe and not just talk tough on national security?

                Again we see lots of talk, lots of chat and lots of yelling from the opposition on matters of national security. The one thing that's missing is action. As home affairs minister Mr Dutton spent years telling us that he'd closed the back door to Australia. Now we find out that he left the front gate wide open and swinging in the breeze. His search for political division does nothing to make people safer. Let's not forget the mess that Mr Dutton left the

                portfolio in—a visa backlog of one million people and dodgy international education systems funnelling visa rorts every single day. Report after report found gaping holes in Mr Dutton's rorted visa system, which was letting criminals into the country—a visa system that allowed foreign organised crime syndicates into the country.

                    Mr Dutton's record is a visa system that allowed foreign organised crime syndicates into the country. These included the Albanian mafia, who engaged in drug trafficking, money laundering, slavery and sexual exploitation. What did he do in the wake of all of those reports? He cut compliance officers by 50 per cent.

                           Mr Dutton and his team have had a lot to say in the last couple of weeks about hardened criminals being released into the community, but it seems that they don't apply the same standard to their own senators. I was surprised to see weekend reports that a Liberal senator urged the Albanese government to release a child sex offender from immigration detention in circumstances similar to those the coalition is now politicising. In a letter to the immigration minister, Senator Dean Smith asked for a man convicted of having sex with a girl aged between 13 and 16 to be transferred from

                           </a>
                           to the community. What have we heard from Mr Dutton? Absolute silence. Contrast that with Mr Dutton's remarks in 2021 when confronted with a similar situation. He said, 'Why would a member of parliament defend anyone who has been convicted of paedophilia?' For Mr Dutton there is one standard for the government and a different standard for his own people—utter hypocrisy. When it's one of his own calling for offenders to be released into the community he has nothing to say.

Media reporting today revealed an immigration detainee who refused a mandatory electronic tracker was uncontactable by police following their release in response to the High Court decision earlier this month. Will the minister confirm whether there is an individual who was released from immigration detention currently residing in the community and uncontactable by our law enforcement agencies?

Our government is putting in place the strict measures we need to make sure that, if one single individual violates their visa conditions, it's a criminal offence. I point out that only yesterday in the House of Representatives our government tried to amend tough laws to make them tougher. What did the opposition do? They voted against them, just like they voted against cost-of-living relief. They called for cost-of-living relief and they voted against it. They called for tough laws and they voted against them.

                                      In the meantime, our government will continue to put in place the tough measures that we need to make sure that, if one single individual violates their visa conditions, as is alleged to be the case at the moment, that will be deemed to be a criminal offence. These individuals have been released under the strictest possible visa conditions, and they are being monitored by a joint Border Force and

And I dare say that they will be subject to criminal charges once they are captured. That's obviously a matter for the Federal Police, but I dare say that they will be subject to those kinds of criminal charges for breaching the visa conditions that were imposed on that individual. And I think they'll regret their actions. What we're focused on is ensuring that we have a tough correct response. We welcome the support the opposition provided us when legislation was passed here in the last sitting week, and I'm very surprised the opposition voted with the Greens yesterday against making those laws even tougher.

                                           Legislation passed by the parliament in the last sitting week established a regime whereby high-risk individuals released from immigration detention are required to wear an electronic bracelet unless the minister is satisfied they don't pose a risk to the community. Does the minister agree that by definition the individual in question poses a risk to the community given they refused to wear an electronic tracker prior to going on the run?

Again I repeat: that stands in great contrast to the actions of your own Senator Smith who called for a convicted paedophile to be released from community detention without any monitoring, without any bracelets and without any actions whatsoever. We're actually trying to be responsible here and protect community safety, while you're out there applying one standard to the government and a completely different standard to your own people. When are you going to be consistent about this? If you're actually tough on these matters, then the same standards should apply to your own people, rather than having letters written to immigration ministers asking for convicted paedophiles to be released into the community without any monitoring whatsoever. We stand by our record and stand by our tough laws.
