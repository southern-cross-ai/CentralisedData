        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Watt. Exotic diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and lumpy skin disease have the potential to pose a very serious threat to our livestock industry. Can the minister please update the Senate on the steps that this government is taking to ensure that our nation is prepared should an outbreak occur?

        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Ciccone, for your ongoing interest in this important matter. As I have consistently said, the first point to make on anything regarding this matter is that Australia remains foot-and-mouth disease free, and the Albanese government is working hard in partnership with the states, territories and industries to keep it that way. While the risk of foot-and-mouth disease or lumpy skin disease entering Australia is low, it is not zero. As I've said before, experts have assessed the risk of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Australia over the next five years as 11.6 per cent and a lumpy skin disease outbreak as 28 per cent. We cannot assume it will stay that way, and that's why we need to keep doing more.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've previously spoken of our two-pronged approach: taking action at home and abroad. Today, I'm pleased to announce a new, third prong: taking action now to make sure we will be fully prepared if an outbreak were to occur here. That's why, earlier today, I announced the creation of a new exotic animal disease task force to ensure Australia is fully prepared to respond swiftly to growing biosecurity threats. The task force will thoroughly assess our current level of national preparedness and advise of any improvements needed. While the federal, state and territory governments all have well-developed security response plans in place, we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that we are ready should an outbreak occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, this task force will be a vehicle for collaboration across the Commonwealth, and it will be co-chaired by senior officials from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Emergency Management Australia
         </a>
         and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It will also include officials from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force
         </a>
         , Border Force, and Animal Health Australia. By bringing together the best expertise from across government, we can ensure there are no gaps in our response. I note the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          National Farmers Federation
         </a>
         has welcomed this announcement, saying, 'It's the right idea', and this continues the close partnership between the Albanese government and industry in managing biosecurity. Good governments plan for the best and prepare for the worst; that's exactly what we are doing.

           I'm sure the industry is very appreciative of the decisive action that you're taking on this matter. Could you please explain to the Senate the role that the state and territory governments will play in preparing for a potential biosecurity outbreak in Australia?

            Thank you, Senator Ciccone. As I have said before, biosecurity is everyone's responsibility, from the federal government through to state and territory governments as well as farmers, importers, exporters and international travellers. Last night I spoke with each state and territory agriculture minister to inform them of the establishment of the federal exotic animal disease preparedness task force and to discuss their own efforts to prepare for a foot-and-mouth disease or lumpy skin disease outbreak should one occur. While the task force will comprise federal officials, it will work closely with states and territories. We have also spoken with industry to ensure that their views are being heard, and they will be engaged to assist the task force as required.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is this spirit of collaboration and desire to work together to ensure that state and federal government response plans are robust that is a hallmark of the Albanese government and is something deeply appreciated by all levels of government as well as industry. On this side of the chamber we are focused on getting the job done, because this issue and the people it affects are more important than politics.

               Thank you again, Senator Ciccone. As we all remember, the response to COVID-19 was the most important global human health response in recent memory. If we have learned one thing from this experience, it is that the Australian government needs to be prepared ahead of time for an event as potentially catastrophic as an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, and that means working with all levels of government in a constructive and respectful way. We are not determined not to make the same mistakes the previous government did.
              </p>
              <p>
               When COVID hit, the former coalition government weren't prepared. They were slow to close borders, leaving management to the states; slow on
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAT" rel="nofollow">
                RAT
               </a>
               s; and too slow on vaccines. Of course Australians paid the price. When floods and fires hit, the former coalition government wasn't prepared. When the former fire chiefs tried to warn them about what was coming, the former government wouldn't even meet them. We won't make the same mistake. If there were to be a major biosecurity outbreak in Australia, there would simply be no time to delay, and that's why we have implemented the strongest biosecurity response ever and why we will keep working on preparedness.
