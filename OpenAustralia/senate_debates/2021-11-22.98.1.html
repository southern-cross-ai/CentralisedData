         I thank Senator Fawcett for his question. The Australian government have been very strong in our support of an Indo-Pacific region that is stable, secure and prosperous and in which all states, large and small, are sovereign and resilient.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         is at the heart of this vision, and Australia's relationship with ASEAN is fundamental to promoting it.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 27 October we took a significant step forward in that relationship when, as part of the first annual ASEAN-Australia Summit, ASEAN leaders agreed to Australia's proposal to enhance relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership. This is a decision which reflects the strength of our ties as neighbours. Australia is ASEAN's first dialogue partner, and this is the first time that ASEAN's leaders have agreed to establish a comprehensive strategic partnership. Enhancing our relationship to a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSP" rel="nofollow">
          CSP
         </a>
         positions that partnership for the future and helps us address complex and emerging regional challenges together. This is all about substance and deeper cooperation between ASEAN and Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         During my recent visit to South-East Asia, I met again with ASEAN ambassadors and the ASEAN secretary-general in Jakarta and had productive discussions on the implementation of the CSP. To support that cooperation, Australia will invest over $150 million into our cooperation with ASEAN, including a new Australia for ASEAN Futures Initiative, supporting projects that address complex challenges, including health security, terrorism and transnational crime, energy security, and promoting the circular economy and healthy oceans. There are also Australia for ASEAN Scholarships, to support those emerging leaders engaging here in Australia, and an Australia for ASEAN Digital Transformation and Futures Skills Initiative, which includes
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
          VET
         </a>
         scholarships. These are measures which build on the $500 million investment in South-East Asia's recovery, which we announced last year in the context of COVID-19, and our very strong bilateral partnerships across the Indo-Pacific region.

            countries, including Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia, and met with counterparts to further advance our relationships, including our cooperation on the region's important COVID-19 recovery. The range of issues we covered demonstrated the depth and breadth of these partnerships. They included the strategic environment and the situation in Myanmar, cyber, counterterrorism, mental health, maritime security, transitions to low-emissions technologies, trade and investment relationships, and women, peace and security. This was an opportunity to deepen our practical cooperation with Malaysia, to welcome Cambodia's role as

               I thank Senator Fawcett again for his supplementary question. Australia has made a commitment to share 60 million COVID-19 vaccines with our Indo-Pacific partners by the end of 2022. That includes 20 million vaccines for Indonesia and 7.8 million for Vietnam. We have also committed $300 million in vaccine support to South-East Asia and a further $100 million to the Quad Vaccine Partnership. Already, we have shared more than 6.2 million doses with
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
                ASEAN
               </a>
               countries, which includes 4.6 million doses to Indonesia and 1.5 million doses to Vietnam. We've also partnered with Indonesia to provide emergency COVID assistance, including oxygen-related and other medical supplies, support for Indonesia's health response, and community resilience through our work with
