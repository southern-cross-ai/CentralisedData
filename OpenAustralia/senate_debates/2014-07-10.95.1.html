        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. I note that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Nurses'_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Nurses' Union
        </a>
        estimate that this year only around 600 of the 2,500 nursing graduates will be successful in gaining employment and many of these will be employed in temporary and part-time positions. Can the senator explain why the federal government continues to support the importation of overseas nurses and midwives on 457 working visas while Queensland has the highest level of new graduate unemployment and underemployment in the nursing and midwifery sector?

         I thank Senator Lazarus for his question. I understand it is his first question in this place, so congratulations. I make the point that, in relation to the 457 scheme, this government does support foreign workers, absolutely; however, I also make the point that it is a fundamental position of this government that where there is an Australian worker who is ready, willing and able to perform a job or a role then we expect the employer to look to this person first.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the statistics on 457 visas, I inform the senator as follows. As at the end of April 2014, the growth in the subclass 457 program under this government had actually slowed compared to what it was under the former government and in particular former Minister O'Connor. Growth of the program under former Minister Brendan O'Connor actually blew out. The program under this government is actually responding, as it is meant to, to what currently is a softening labour market. In other words, under the former government, despite the former government's rhetoric in relation to foreign workers and that it expects Australian employers to employ them first, the actual facts show that that was not the case under Minister O'Connor. Under this government the number of 457s applications has decreased and the program is doing exactly what it is intended to do, and that is contract with a softening labour market.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Will the minister give an undertaking to review the numbers of 457 worker visas issued for Queensland that allow foreign workers to take Australian jobs and, as part of the review, take into account the higher level of Australian nursing graduates who fail to gain employment in Queensland or are forced to take temporary or part-time positions?

           I acknowledge Senator Lazarus's concerns in relation to that issue. I say again to Senator Lazarus: it is the fundamental principle of this government that, where there is an Australian ready, willing and able to be employed, we expect an Australian employer to do exactly that. In relation to whether I will have a look at the number of people employed on visas in Queensland, the senator may not be aware but earlier this year, because of what had occurred under the former government, in particular the blow-out in relation to the number of 457 visa holders in this country, I instituted a review into the 457 visa program. It looked at a number of issues. I believe it spoke to in excess of 100 people and received in excess of 160 submissions. It is one of the most widely canvassed reviews to date. I recently received the report.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the minister concerned about the high rate of casualisation in all public services, including importantly the healthcare sector? Does the minister know how difficult it is to obtain a home loan, a car loan or salary sacrifice without full-time employment?

             Senator Lazarus, I go back to my position that under this government the number of 457 workers has actually decreased compared to what were actually in the country under the previous government. Again I go back to this government's fundamental principle that, if there is an Australian ready, willing and able to undertake a job, we expect an employer to look to that person first by way of an employee. As I was also saying, the independent review panel have now handed down the report to me. I am currently considering their recommendations. I will be making announcements in due course in relation to the 457 visa program.
