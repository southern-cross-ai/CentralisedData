        When the Albanese government granted the long-suffering Murugappan family from Biloela a permanent visa last month, I found myself cautiously hopeful that it might signal a shift in the way we treat refugees in this country. How wrong I was. For many months, I have been advocating for the release of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
         Ned Kelly
        </a>
        , a 37-year-old Iranian refugee being held in detention in WA. Almost a decade ago, Ned sought our protection, fleeing his home country of Iran to Australia, facing persecution and in great danger. Our response as a nation has been to lock him up and to throw away the key.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contrary to what the major parties might tell you, there is nothing illegal about Ned's actions. It is his right as a human being to seek asylum. It is our legal and moral obligation as a nation to provide it. In a letter in February, I wrote to then home affairs minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Karen Andrews
        </a>
        , pleading with her to provide the necessary supports to Ned, whose torture by our own hands has resulted in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
         PTSD
        </a>
        , in self-harm and in several suicide attempts. The minister did not respond to my letter, nor has the new government responded to my calls for Ned's release. Sadly, this is not a surprise. Despite their claims of compassion for asylum seekers, the Albanese government's position is to support the depraved coalition border policies that keep people like Ned detained indefinitely. This is a national shame, and the Greens will push back against it until every single refugee in detention is freed.
