        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Nick Sherry, and it is in regard to the increasing contention about coal seam gas and open-cut coal mining in rural areas of Australia. Has the government received representations from former National Party leader

             In the initial part of his question, Senator Brown referred to some areas of disagreement, dispute and criticism of coal seam gas. I am aware that there are some areas of controversy. Whether those criticisms are valid or not, I am not aware.

               I am aware there are some issues of contention with coal seam gas and I have seen various media reports on some aspects of that activity. I am aware that the use of coal seam gas as an energy source is a very longstanding practice in this country and it accounts for about 30 per cent of domestic gas production in the

It is not to my knowledge that they are officers of those companies. They may be, but I would have to take that on notice and find out whether that is correct. If it is correct, I am not personally aware of any activities that they have undertaken. They certainly have not seen or discussed with me anything in relation to what may be their perfectly legitimate representations on behalf of the commercial entities that they represent. As to any representations they may have made to any other ministers—

                     On a point of order on relevance and the factual premise of his question, is he saying that these people still have an involvement in the federal National party? They do not.
