        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Minister, Australian exports that end up in Israel, whether they are parts of F35 fighter planes, engines for drones used by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDF" rel="nofollow">
         IDF
        </a>
        , material for vehicle armour or any other number of types of military equipment, risk being used to carry out genocide. Furthermore, your own department's recently released figures show that even in October 2023 Australia provided further arms and ammunition to the state of Israel. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court" rel="nofollow">
         International Court
        </a>
        of Justice found that there's a plausible case of genocide being committed by the state of Israel on the population of Gaza. Following this finding, why has your government not publicly and clearly announced an urgent ban on the export of military equipment to Israel?

         There are a number of assertions in that question that I might respond to. First, on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICJ" rel="nofollow">
          ICJ
         </a>
         , I would refer you to my answer to Senator Faruqi yesterday, where I referenced the joint statement with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         in relation to the findings of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court" rel="nofollow">
          International Court
         </a>
         of Justice and the expectation Australia has articulated that Israel will comply with the findings and statements of that court. The second point I would make—and I appreciate that you asked that with a slightly better tone on this occasion—is that I do think there's been a lot of misinformation and disinformation, some of which was included in your question, in a debate which has seen some of the worst social disharmony in our country in many years, certainly since I can remember. Everyone in this chamber, including the Greens, has a responsibility to deal with differences of opinion, which are very deeply felt, in ways which are respectful and which do not rely on disinformation, misinformation and false facts.

            interjecting
           </a>
           when I'm responding to you is another example of it. We have seen the sorts of vitriol on social media and the sorts of falsehoods that are stated, some of which this party repeats in this chamber. I would have hoped that a progressive party might actually prioritise social harmony in these times. You're entitled to your views in a democracy. I have seen some of what people have said, including those in this chamber, where they know it to be false.

             Minster, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, you prohibited the export of aluminium to Moscow, as it formed 'key components in the manufacture and development of weapons', yet, under the Albanese government, Australia continues to export millions of dollars of aluminium to the

             , which recent reports by Israeli media made clear is being used in the manufacture of domestic weapons. Why haven't you publicly prohibited the export to the State of Israel of aluminium and other materials that can be used to make weapons, given there's a plausible case of genocide?

              Because I didn't get a chance to do so in the first answer, can I first reiterate what the government has made clear and what I have made clear in this chamber on numerous occasions: Australia has not supplied weapons to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years.
             </p>
             <p>
              An honourable senator: That's not the question.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was an answer to the first question. Notwithstanding the fact that you assert something else publicly, Senator Shoebridge, it is the answer that I have been advised by the department. In relation to the second, this is where there is a difference between the government and the Greens. We do not have a policy of boycotting all exports to Israel. I appreciate that is the position that you are seeking, but we do not have a policy of disengaging from Israel economically. I appreciate you have a different view—

                  I wonder if Senator Shoebridge issued a press release welcoming the doubling of the core funding of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA" rel="nofollow">
                   UNRWA
                  </a>
                  when Labor did that. Did he issue a press release? Or did Senator Faruqi or any of the Greens issue a press release congratulating us and recognising how important that was? Did you do that? No. Because actually your focus is how you use this conflict to extract votes, and it is reprehensible.

                       <p>
                        I said yesterday, in answer to a question from Senator Faruqi, that I think there are two irrefutable facts in relation to
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA" rel="nofollow">
                         UNRWA
                        </a>
                        . One is that it is necessary in order to deliver humanitarian support in the occupied Palestinian territories, in particular in Gaza at this time—absolutely, which is why we increased the funding. The second irrefutable fact is that serious allegations have been made. I spoke yesterday with the chief of UNRWA about what measures can be taken to resolve this issue, because we are being constructive.
