        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib. Can the minister confirm that the department of the environment was given explicit verbal instructions to deal directly with him on the Home Insulation Program rather than with the then responsible minister, Minister Garrett?

         I would remind the good senator and those opposite about the follies of placing too much stock in emails that have allegedly been leaked by public servants. In relation to the email that the good senator is referring to, I will take on some of those allegations. At no stage was I advised, or did I advise, that the Home Insulation Program needed to be delayed. As I have said on numerous occasions, I was present when risk to the Commonwealth and program risk were discussed regarding the Home Insulation Program. The advice to me was that these risks were being managed during the implementation of the scheme by the department of the environment. Also, at no stage did I direct, or am I aware of any direction, that I be briefed instead of Minister Garrett regarding the Home Insulation Program and I do not believe that any direction was given.
        </p>

         . Also in that email that Senator Cormann is referring to were allegations regarding the media opportunities. I reject those. It may be the good senator’s next question, so I hope that I am not taking his next question from him. I find it very difficult to believe the email about being offered media opportunities first. My record shows that I attended only five media engagements regarding this program over 12 months and two of those were with Mr Garrett.

          I ask a supplementary question,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
           Mr President
          </a>
          . I note that the minister has not ruled out that there was an instruction to deal directly with him at the expense of the former minister, Minister Garrett, in relation to the Home Insulation Program. Given that fact, does the minister now take personal responsibility for the home insulation fiasco?

           That is an absolute misrepresentation of my answer. Again I state that at no stage did I direct anyone, or am I aware of a direction, to brief me instead of Minister Garrett regarding the program, and I do not believe that direction was given at any time.

             As I have said consistently—and remember, this was a matter that was debated for almost a week of Senate proceedings—I was present at meetings where risks in the Home Insulation Program were discussed, but these again did not include electrocution or fire risk. It is also clear that the government recognised that occupational health and safety would need to be considered in the rollout of the program. Features like the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OHS" rel="nofollow">
              OHS
             </a>
             White Card were built into the system by design and the government took steps to ensure that industry developed the right training for workers under the program including training around safety. The best people to work up that package were the Construction and Property Services Industry Skills Council, the peak body for the industry. It is not the role of government to lecture the experts about what training is needed for workers in a particular industry. The skills council consulted widely with relevant industry organisations.
