         Bill
        </a>
        2018 to provide an entitlement to five days' unpaid family and domestic violence leave for all employees under the Fair Work Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill ensures eight million Australian workers will have access to this leave if they experience family and domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The tragic events we have witnessed in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        only this week are a potent reminder of the heavy toll taken by violence on Australian families.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Again I express my deepest sympathies for all who have been touched by these terrible events.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The scourge of family violence strikes at the heart of our communities and continues to impact far too many Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It causes great pain and anguish to those who experience it, their children and their loved ones. Its debilitating effects ripple out and compound from there.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Too often it threatens workers' ability to hold down a job – to provide for themselves and their families, to participate fully in the workforce and to fulfil their potential.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And as Minister for Women, I know that women are significantly more likely to experience family violence and deal with the consequences for their livelihoods and careers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At a time of record levels of female employment and a record low gender pay gap, this Bill will help protect Australian workers at their time of greatest need, and in doing so support their financial security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will ensure they can take time to deal with the impact of family and domestic violence and help overcome the obstacles it creates – confident that their job is protected while they do so.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will provide time to seek support and counselling; to involve the police and authorities; to attend court hearings or to relocate and get re-established.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government has a strong commitment to fairness, and this extends to maintaining a genuine and balanced safety-net for those in our community who need that support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By enshrining the leave in the National Employment Standards, all employees covered by the Fair Work Act will be guaranteed the minimum leave entitlement, regardless of whether they are:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        And a full five days' leave will be available each year, from the anniversary of the date they commenced employment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly however, the leave will not be available to individuals who seek to take it as perpetrators of family and domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to this Bill, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Coalition Government
        </a>
        is taking comprehensive action to address family violence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have zero tolerance for violence against women and children, committing well in excess of $300 million to address their safety.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the most recent Federal Budget we committed an additional $54 million for women's safety initiatives, including $11.5 million for 1800
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RESPECT" rel="nofollow">
         RESPECT
        </a>
        , $6.7 million for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV" rel="nofollow">
         DV
        </a>
        -alert, $14.2 million for the Office of the eSafety Commissioner to help make cyberspace safe for women, and $22 million to combat elder abuse.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill extends the decision of the Fair Work Commission in March 2018 to grant five days' unpaid leave to employees covered by modern awards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At that time, the Coalition Government made a commitment to extend the entitlement to up to an additional six million people covered by the Fair Work Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill delivers on that commitment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It also ensures a level playing field for employers. Many small businesses employ their staff under a modern award and hence their staff already have access to the leave based on the Fair Work Commission's decision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will ensure big businesses, which are more likely to employ staff under enterprise agreements and individual arrangements, will also need to provide this minimum leave entitlement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I know good employers already provide caring and compassionate support to employees who experience family violence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Enshrining this leave in the National Employment Standards extends a guaranteed entitlement to workers who do not currently have access to such leave.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Fair Work Commission made its decision to provide five days' unpaid leave after carefully considering extensive evidence and submissions from unions, employers and other interested parties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         The Commission
        </a>
        indicated it will revisit consideration of this issue in mid-2021.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Providing five days' unpaid family and domestic violence leave for all employees covered by the Fair Work Act is the right step to take now.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I urge you to support the Bill and to pass it quickly, so that up to six million additional workers are guaranteed access to this important, new workplace right without delay.
