        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Can the minister correct misleading claims about the labour market testing provisions applicable to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement? How do these labour market testing provisions compare with free trade agreements signed by the previous government?

         I thank Senator Lindgren for her question. I can inform the Senate about the incorrect and misleading claims in relation to labour market testing and the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, as those of us on this side and certainly the majority of Australians know, will not remove any requirement to hire Australian workers first. Australian workers need to know that there is a wilful and dishonest campaign of deceit being run by the militant union movement, and in particular by the

                 does not go through there will be no jobs. That is what those on the other side do not seem to understand. We on this side understand that when you sign free trade agreements you create job opportunities for Australians. That is what we on this side of the chamber are all about. The stance of those on the other side is made all the more hypocritical given that the labour market testing provisions in the chapter are identical to those in other free trade agreements signed by those on the other side, including the free trade agreement signed with Chile.

                   s, companies will not be able to pay lower pages to foreign workers. The project agreement program makes it very, very clear that all overseas employees under a project labour agreement must be employed under terms and conditions that are no less favourable to the employer's Australian workforce.

These requirements are not subject to negotiation.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister advise the Senate how other provisions contained within the China-Australia free trade agreement compare to free trade agreements signed by the previous governments?

                     However, there is one point of difference that those on the other side may wish to know about. In respect of the ChAFTA, it is that Australia has agreed to the investment facilitation agreements for companies to encourage large-scale investment in Australia.
