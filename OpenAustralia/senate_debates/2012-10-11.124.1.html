        Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Manufacture Levy) Amendment Bill 2011

       <p class="italic">
        This Bill is part of a package implementing the carbon pricing mechanism and related reforms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Manufacture Levy) Act 1995 (the Manufacture Levy Act) together with the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 (the Ozone Act) provide the framework to apply levies to the manufacture of ozone depleting substances and synthetic greenhouse gases.

        This Bill provides that the manufacture of

         Kyoto Protocol
        </a>
        synthetic greenhouse gases, namely hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, will be subject to the carbon price by way of the existing levy structure. The carbon charge will be calculated based on the carbon dioxide equivalence of the gas, multiplied by the applicable charge. The carbon price will be in addition to the existing levy imposed by the Manufacture Levy Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill also enables the Minister to determine that a licensee is exempt from paying the levy where the Minister is satisfied that the circumstances prescribed in the Manufacture Levy Act, or circumstances prescribed in regulations made for the Manufacture Levy Act, have been met. These circumstances include the manufacture of medical equipment, or if it is impracticable to impose the levy.
