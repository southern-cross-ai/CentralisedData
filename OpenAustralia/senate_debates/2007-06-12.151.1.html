        Tonight I want to acknowledge in this place the wonderful contribution that a remarkable family of Lebanese migrants have made to my hometown of Toowoomba and also the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">

        generally. I had heard that there was a celebration in Toowoomba a couple of years ago to celebrate 50 years of Hannas stores in Toowoomba. That piqued my interest because, growing up in Toowoomba, the Hanna family are indeed an icon for our community. I felt that it was important that we acknowledge the wonderful work that this family has done in my town. I was very happy to find out that several years ago
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_University" rel="nofollow">
         Bond University
        </a>
        , in the special program looking at the issue of family businesses in Queensland, published a book called

          Southern Cross

        </i>
        , which was developed by students at Bond University, talking about family businesses in Queensland. In fact, it is subtitled
        <i>
         The Untold Stories of Queensland’s Family Businesses
        </i>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President

        , I think this could be the subject of many an adjournment debate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was pleased that Judith Hanna had actually contributed to that publication in 2000. That got me thinking about what my own memories were of the Hannas in Toowoomba and also some history of the way that this family came from Lebanon in 1939. At that time they came from the community of Kfarsghab in Lebanon. They came to the Darling Downs via Sydney, which was the normal way that many people came. I see Senator Joyce across the chamber here. He would know that there are large numbers of Lebanese families living profitably and valuably in Toowoomba. I was lucky enough to grow up in a community that had many Lebanese families—the Betros, the Moses, the Bou-Samra’s—many others. But always Mr and Mrs Hanna—the matriarch and patriarch of the family. Hannas store in the centre of Toowoomba provided service to so many families.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of the background, Mr Hanna’s history reflected that of so many others who came to make a go, a new life, in Australia. He came with his wife Lavina and brand new baby son Joseph, who is now an active member of the community in Toowoomba. They came in 1939. They originally went out to Goondiwindi to work with other people who had emigrated. Originally, like so many people from Lebanon, they started working in the community taking around fruit and veggies—selling in the local community, establishing themselves and establishing their business and providing direct personal service.
       </p>
       <p>
        They later made a transition into the drapery business. I do not think there would be anyone who has worked or lived in Toowoomba who does not know the Hannas Family Department Store. We have watched them grow. In fact, it was when they celebrated their 50th anniversary that I realised I had grown up with them in town. Not only the amazing service and the way they had developed such a strong business in the area, but I think that extra generosity in community service that has become synonymous with the family name Hanna in that town. I know that when my own family was going through a pretty rough time when I was young, my mother was able to receive service at the Hannas family drapery, providing us with uniforms that would make us able to go to school at that time with a smile, with understanding and sensitivity that helped us over a very bad patch. And I know that that is only one story of so many in that community.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Mr Hanna died he was 83 and had his funeral at my family church,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Anthony" rel="nofollow">
         St Anthony
        </a>
        ’s. My dad and Mr Hanna shared a couple of passions. One was their dedication to the local community, one was their feeling that there was one church only and that was St Anthony’s. I think that was the only way you could have certainty in your life, that St Anthony’s was where the church services were held. When Mr Hanna died and had his mass service there in 1998, and I do remember it, more than 800 people turned out for that particular service. There was a quote there that I remember, which sums up the man:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Hanna was a special person. He was my idea of a thorough gentleman. He had such dignity and manners. I shall always treasure the warmth and friendliness with which he and Mrs Hanna welcomed me into their home.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Mr Hanna died he was survived by his wife Lavina, 10 children, 35 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. I know that that has been added to since that time. That sums up in many ways the contribution that people from Lebanon made to my local community. I know now that Dr Anne Monsour has developed a body of work looking at the role of Lebanese migration into the community. That is being built up now and it is something we can look to with pride. Also when we see the horror that is occurring in modern Lebanon, we can feel with the people who are sharing our lives in Australia and understand that they are torn by what is happening to their homeland and see that we are blessed with peace here, which is not able to be shared by many of their families overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Mr Hanna was building up his business in Toowoomba and in the local area, he was able to bring his special style of service and translate that into the development of a very effective business. There were stories about the way that he would help people out. There were stories about the way that he worked most closely with his community. I do want to tell one story that was well known in the local community. Judith has printed it in her story. It was when Mr Hanna was making the transition to the drapery side of things. He was able to travel to different places and work with people and sell from his van, which developed from a small van up to a bigger one then to his store in Toowoomba. The story goes—and I do believe it is true; it has gone into legend in Toowoomba—that he was visiting a local farm and he was talking to one of the farmers there who wanted to buy a bra for his wife. He asked the man what size would be required. The man confidently replied that a six and seven-eighths would be just about right. Mr Hanna was a bit concerned about this and said, ‘Sir, I don’t think this is the size.’ The man went on to say—and not with gestures—that that was in fact his hat size and he knew that that was the right size for the purchase that he made. Remembering Mr Hanna, remembering the joy with which he provided service across his area, I can well believe this is a true story.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remember, just thinking back, the wonderful laughter that would spread out from Mr Hanna when he was mixing with our community so often with his generosity of spirit when he was providing donations—most often without selling himself or his family or talking about what he was doing—and the amazing generosity that he gave in various donations, particularly to the local football clubs, community clubs. I know the local branch of the family now in the horseracing sector, but I can hear the laughter that Mr Hanna would have, particularly when he was dealing with that farmer.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to acknowledge the wonderful contribution that families like the Hannas and so many others have been able to make to our community. We acknowledge their business acumen because now we know just how successful businesses such as theirs are. But more than that, it is the commitment that families such as the Hannas have made to their local communities, that long legacy of family values, of commitment, of their hope that they are able to provide a better future for the children that they are bringing into their new world while maintaining a very strong commitment to their own country. I know that we have been made better in our community by the contribution of the Hanna family. We acknowledge and celebrate their success in business, in the development of their family activities and in the way that they have given so much from such a very difficult start. I commend this family, I commend the work that they have done and I hope that we can provide more messages to people who are making that decision to start a new life to work more effectively in their communities. I see and I celebrate with them and I hope that we can hear much more about family businesses that have contributed to our Queensland landscape.
