        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. Will the minister update the Senate on the rebuild of Galiwinku, following tropical cyclones Lam and Nathan last year? How is the government working in partnership with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        government and the community to rebuild the community and repair housing?

         I thank the senator for that question. It is a timely question because we have just passed the one-year anniversary of 20 February 2015, when terrible damage and destruction was caused across north-east
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem_Land" rel="nofollow">
          Arnhem Land
         </a>
         by Cyclone Lam.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am pleased to be able to report that the Commonwealth has been working in close partnership with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         government and the community to make sure that the rebuild effort is as successful as possible. Immediately following the cyclones, thousands of fallen trees were cleared.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          The Northern Territory
         </a>
         government got straight in there to restore all essential and community services to keep the community functioning. Through joint Commonwealth and Northern Territory government funding, we have completed major and moderate repairs to 160 houses in Galiwinku and we are well underway with the construction of a further 80 houses that are being rebuilt. Most importantly, local Aboriginal businesses like Gumatj timber have been contracted, in Gumatj's case to make all of the roof trusses that will build long-term capacity in the region. All the roof trusses are built out of the local eucalyptus tetrodonta.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was fortunate enough to spend the day in Galiwinku last month, and I must congratulate the community on their resilience and participation in the building effort. One positive that came from the rebuilding process was governments' commitment to work with the community, and I was pleased to observe how the community views have been taken into account throughout the rebuild, from ensuring that the rebuilding program was structured to support local employment to ensuring that temporary accommodation was away from the sites that the local leadership had earmarked for economic development projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         During my visit last month, I was very impressed that residents wanted to talk to me about their ideas for new businessesâ€”everything from taking on a new fishing licence to running a landscaping option for all the new houses. This community has ideas and it is this government's place to set the foundation to allow these to grow, and not get in the way. Further works are being planned, including a new clinic, additional cyclone shelter and multipurpose hall, to ensure the communities function again at full capacity, ready for any future challenges that come our way.

           governments absolutely share is to maximise community participation, employment and training in the rebuilding of Galiwinku. Whilst the damage caused over 12 months ago was terrible, we must also think about the opportunities that came our way. I am very pleased those opportunities have not been ignored. We now utilise local labour and support local businesses in the rebuilding program. Half of the workforce constructing the houses are Yolngu. Over 90 local Yolngu people got a real job through rebuilding projects across a range of construction disciplines in key roles like managing the evacuation camp and community clean-up. I congratulate the

           , for sharing this vision, which requires work being completed in Aboriginal communities to meet high targets for Indigenous contracting and procurement. This is an example we should follow across government.

             and Territory governments are focused on making this investment build on other programs and on delivering the change needed to make these improvements sustainable. This is part of our efforts to address intergenerational disadvantage in remote Indigenous communities. The employment outcomes from the rebuild program are outstanding, and I am pleased to see that the days of fly-in fly-out workforcesâ€”white men with nail bagsâ€”appear to be behind us in Indigenous affairs. The local Community Development Program provided by the

             government and contractors to secure placements and training and, ultimately, real jobs for job seekers in Galiwinku. The new Community Development Program provides communities with the flexibility to engage job seekers in a wide range of activities and pays providers based on outcomes rather than just engagement. We can see how this Commonwealth program is working with this rebuild to leave a lasting benefit and legacy for the community.
