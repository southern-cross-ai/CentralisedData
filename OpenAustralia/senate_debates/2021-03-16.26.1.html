        My question is to the Minister for Women, Senator Payne. On the treatment of women in the parliament, the Minister for Women has said, 'The only way it will change is if we, as parliamentarians, own the problems, own the failings and make the necessary changes.' Attorney-General Porter has sat on the
        <i>
         Respect@work
        </i>
        report for a year, responding to only three of the 55 recommendations. Will the Minister for Women call on the Attorney-General to own his failings and make the necessary changes to implement the remaining 52 recommendations one year on?

         The government has taken a number of steps to address a component of the recommendations addressed to the Commonwealth. Those recommendations were outlined in the Women's Economic Security Statement process through the budget, and the government is actively considering the remaining recommendations in detail, with a view to continuing to implement that response as soon as possible this year. I want to acknowledge the work that's being done by Senator Stoker, the new Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General, in that regard. Additionally, Safe Work Australia has been doing very important work in this space, including by releasing its sexual harassment in the workplace guidance earlier this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also refer to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's words in relation to the report, acknowledging as I did, in fact, in a question asked of me recently, that COVID, along with a number of matters before government at the time, did have an impact on this process. A number of the key recommendations have been funded, in particular looking at the next survey, getting together the Workplace
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Harassment" rel="nofollow">

         Council and some education and training resources.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite seek to ignore this, but I do think it is actually important to acknowledge that as a report about workplaces the report's recommendations are not limited to government alone. While the government naturally has had to direct its resources to immediate priorities, I think the commissioner has also been encouraged by the level of influence she has seen the report have in workplaces, the main subject of concern over the past year. I said in response to a question last week or the week before—and I am not sure from whom that question came—that the report also involves other governments, plus business in particular and a number of agencies, including Safe Work, as I have already referred to, and Fair Work Australia. It is not an entirely government—

            The Attorney-General is currently on a period of leave. The acting Attorney-General, Minister Cash, is here in this chamber. The Attorney-General has outlined very clearly his position in relation to the issues to which Senator McAllister alludes. This country operates on the basis of the rule of law and the presumption of innocence. It is not possible to be selective about to whom that should and should not apply.

                 There are a number of issues that have been raised, including through the terms of the petition presented to the parliament yesterday. They do support the adoption of the 55 recommendations in the Human Rights Commission's
                 <i>
                  Respect@work
                 </i>
                 report. I've already indicated that those are being considered through the appropriate portfolio minister, actually, and, in terms of recommendations that I was able to address, those recommendations were addressed, including with funding, in the Women's Economic Security Statement in October last year. So the full response, as I said, will be brought forward by the Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General, Senator Stoker. But there are a number of recommendations—for example, the ratification of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILO" rel="nofollow">
                  ILO
