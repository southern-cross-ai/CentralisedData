        Some senators wait until they are called. My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. Will the minister inform senators of the work being done by the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of Australian skies and the security of Australian airports?

        <p>
         This is a very important question for all Australians, in relation to the safety and security of our skies in Australia and internationally. The events in the United Kingdom last week serve as a stark reminder that we cannot be complacent in relation to the fight against terrorism and especially in relation to aviation security. This government has spent $1.1 billion on aviation security in the last five years. In fact, in the last 12 months there has been much done to enhance aviation security in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I have always said, security is a work in progress. Last year we commissioned Sir John Wheeler to carry out a comprehensive inquiry in relation to aviation security in this country. As a result of that, we announced a package of over $350 million in relation to measures which would see a strengthened line of command at our airports, with airport commanders in place at our major airports; increased policing; increased Customs patrols at our airports; and also increased closed-circuit television, which is so important in carrying out that vital monitoring of our major airports.
        </p>
        <p>
         These initiatives are very important for strengthening the security of our airports in this country, but they build on the great work that this government has done over a long period of time in relation to aviation security. Some of those improvements have been as follows. We have increased counterterrorism first response by 40 per cent. The armed

          AFP
         </a>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS" rel="nofollow">
          PS
         </a>
         that you see at our major airports are a product of that initiative. Also, we announced a regional response. That is through the Securing Our Regional Skies program, which is some $48 million. Through that we saw rapid regional response teams. There was a $20 million initiative there. There was also $8 million for hand wand metal detection services, $6.5 million for improved security awareness training for regional airline and airport staff, and just under $7 million for joint training exercises at our regional airports. These are just some of the initiatives that we have announced in relation to regional airports.
        </p>
        <p>
         As well as that, we have our air security officer program in place. That has been working domestically and internationally. We have secured agreements with Singapore, the United States and the Philippines in relation to services between those countries and Australia. It was only in November last year that we had for the first time an international conference on air security officers in this country. I spoke to many representatives from overseas countries who acknowledged our air security officer program as being an outstanding example of how to carry out such an important thing as protecting our skies and making sure that they are not only safe but also secure, as Senator Ferris mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, we approach aviation security as a whole-of-government initiative. We have Transport working in relation to increased perimeter security at our airports. We have the Attorney-Generalâ€™s Department working with Transport on enhancing the security of our ASIC checking. About 100,000 workers at our airports around this country have to have an ASIC and we are ramping up the checking of those people who work at our airports around the country. We have the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         , who are charged with security at our airports, and the airport commanders who, as I mentioned, are AFP officers. And Customs do such an important job at our primary line, not only with advanced clearance checking of the people who are entering Australia but also with increased airside patrols and closed-circuit

         monitoring. Could I just say that, in relation to the agencies that we have, we have first-class service being provided to the community of Australia in protecting our skies, and we are grateful for that.
