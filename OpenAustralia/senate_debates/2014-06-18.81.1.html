        Mr Deputy President, under standing order 191 I want to raise an issue where I have been misquoted. It happened during question time, but I did not want to interrupt question time so I have left it until now. The first question of the day, by Senator Moore, alleged that I had made certain decisions and commitments in relation to an issue in the budget. For the purpose of accuracy can I read out exactly what I said yesterday which was referred to by Senator Moore—

         Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: Senator Macdonald is effectively making a personal explanation about a matter that occurred in question time. It is totally fair enough that that be done, but ordinarily it requires leave; and, by convention in this place, these personal explanations are made after the conclusion of taking note of answers. I do not in any way want to stop Senator Macdonald from making any of the points he cares to make but, given the nature of this current contribution, the tradition is that it ought to conform with longstanding precedent and convention in the chamber.

         <p>
          Mr Deputy President, I am not seeking a personal explanation by leave under standing order 190. I am relying on standing order 191, which says:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          A senator who has spoken to a question may again be heard, to explain some material part of the senator’s speech which has been misquoted or misunderstood, but shall not introduce any new matter, or interrupt any senator speaking …
         </p>
         <p>
          I could have done this at the time Senator Moore misquoted me. I did not, because it was question time and I am not one to make grandstanding statements during question time. This is the appropriate time. Senator Faulkner may have a view about what is the convention of this parliament, but I happen to have a different view. I have not been here as long as Senator Faulkner, but I have been here almost as long and there is no such convention that this must be done at the end of taking note.

           Senator Faulkner, there is no point of order. Senator Macdonald, on the point that you have raised, you are seeking to address a situation where it did not occur in question time. You really were starting to debate the point in question time.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
            Can I
           </a>
           suggest that we reflect on this matter. If we feel that there should be an opportunity for you to make a statement, I am sure leave will be granted after taking note. Senator Macdonald, I think that would be the quickest and most efficient way to handle this. I would like to reflect on it a bit more because of the particular standing order you have raised.

            Mr Deputy President, I accept your ruling as always but I must point out that I was maligned in the first question. This is the first time I have the opportunity of doing it and I am complying with the standing order. I should be given the right at the same time and, might I say, in the same news cycle to put on record exactly what was said, which was not what Senator Moore, in her question, indicated I had said.

             Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I appreciate your points. I would like to reflect on that, and I will take further advice from the Clerk. I think we can get back to you, Senator Macdonald, with an appropriate juncture.
