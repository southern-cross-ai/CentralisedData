        I rise this evening to speak in relation to the Assyrian community, both those people who have settled in Australia and those affected by the very serious situation in Iraq. In March it was a time of celebration for the Assyrian community in Australia. I joined the community to celebrate the Assyrian new year, as I had done for the past eight years, this year to celebrate the beginning of the year 6764. The festival is a very special occasion for the Assyrian community both in Australia and around the world, marking the beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere. It is an ancient tradition passed on from earliest Assyrians who lived in Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assyrian" rel="nofollow">
         The Assyrian
        </a>
        community provides a direct link between ancient times and longstanding traditions. Their rich culture is embedded with the evolution of humanity and it has helped to influence many forms of modern Christianity. Their language of Aramaic was the language of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Jesus_Christ" rel="nofollow">
         Lord Jesus Christ
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Regrettably, the oppression of the Assyrians, often because of their faith, is also testament to their resilience. Understandably, this persecution has meant that increasingly in past decades thousands have sought refuge elsewhere. Indeed, Iraqis are the largest national group that have been resettled under our Humanitarian Program over the last 10 years, and we remain committed to the resettlement of vulnerable Iraqi minorities. It appears that this will not change with the latest developments in Iraq.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike that day in March, it is now not a time for celebration among the Assyrian community as the eyes of Australia and the world turn to the serious situation unfolding in Iraq. Much has been said about the sectarian nature of this conflict. It is a difficult and complex issue. But what many in the chamber might not appreciate is the plight of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Assyrians" rel="nofollow">
         Christian Assyrians
        </a>
        in Iraq who remain in the city of Mosul and nearby towns and villages. Assyrians have already suffered greatly since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. They have faced kidnappings, threats and even deaths due to their ethnicity and religious beliefs. If the Nineveh Plain is subject to military attack, this will have devastating consequences for the indigenous Assyrians and other ethnic groups in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        This explains why the Assyrians have proposed the creation of a new province with regional autonomy to develop a lasting solution to the Assyrian refugee problem. In January 2014, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Iraqi Council
        </a>
        of Ministers in fact gave in-principle approval for the creation of several new provinces, including the Nineveh Plain. When or if that will happen will depend on some consensus emerging out of the conflict, together with a resolution on both the current humanitarian disaster and potential security uncertainty within the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of the current very volatile situation in Iraq, I am proud to be part of a government that is responding to the unfolding humanitarian crisis. As announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs last Friday, Australia will provide $5 million in assistance to support the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing violence in north and north-west Iraq. The Australian government strongly condemns the actions of the terrorist group, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic State
        </a>
        of Iraq and Syria, which continues its campaign of violence in Iraq. We express our deepest condolences for the loss of life in recent attacks and our grave concern at the widespread displacement of Iraqis and damage to property. I can only hope and pray that what emerges in the battle for Iraq is an appreciation of cultural diversity and that freedom to practice religion has some toehold in Iraq.
       </p>
       <p>
        For now, I would particularly like to acknowledge those community representatives dedicated to raising awareness of the Assyrian issue, including Hermiz Shahen,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Secretary_General" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Secretary General
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_Universal_Alliance" rel="nofollow">
         Assyrian Universal Alliance
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_David" rel="nofollow">
         David David
        </a>
        , President of the Assyrian Australian National Federation, and Paul Azzo—and there are others. It is important that we continue to give our ongoing support for an inclusive, united, federal Iraq that promotes security for all its diverse religious and ethnic groups. The systemic purge of the Assyrian community in their traditional homeland must stop, and the strong voice of Australian and international condemnation can help address this urgent issue. It is important that the plight of the religious minorities in Iraq, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_Christians" rel="nofollow">
         Assyrian Christians
        </a>
        , be raised and continue to be raised at international forums such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        . I conclude by congratulating the contribution that the Australian-Assyrian community have made to our great multicultural country—for sharing their culture, for sharing their history and for contributing their unique gifts to a vibrant and diverse Australia.
