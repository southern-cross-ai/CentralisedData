        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. In response to allegations aired earlier this year about branch stacking and misuse of public funds by members of the Victorian Labor Party, the Prime Minister said the issue raised many questions the Leader of the Opposition had to answer, yet when allegations of branch stacking and misuse of taxpayer funds by the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Sukkar, and a senior federal Liberal member were aired this week the Prime Minister said it was an issue for the Victorian Liberal Party and not his responsibility. Why the double standard on integrity?

         I can confirm that the matters that were raised earlier this week are indeed appropriately a matter for the Victorian Liberal Party organisation, which I understand has taken appropriate steps in relation to an individual. That's unlike what was the case with the alternative. It's interesting to see how the Greens are in here pitching for the Labor Party.

         I'm not really all that focused on internal party matters like this; I'm focused on the job that the Australian people want us to do, which is to protect people's health and people's livelihoods through this pandemic. That's what we're focused on. But I can confirm for the good senator that the issues that were raised in relation to internal party matters are indeed matters for the Liberal Party organisation. To the extent there were issues raised about the alleged misuse of taxpayer funded parliamentary resources, these are matters that the relevant federal members concerned had referred for independent inquiry by the

          Department of Finance
         </a>
         , which is the usual process which is applied indiscriminately, on an entirely non-partisan basis, whenever these issues arise, as I'm sure members and senators from all around this and the other chamber would be well aware.

           Scandal after scandal in this term of government has shown that the Prime Minister is reluctant to enforce his own prime ministerial and ministerial standards to lift those standards of behaviour. Will the Prime Minister investigate whether Assistant Treasurer Sukkar's actions have breached the ministerial standards, and will he stand Mr Sukkar down while doing so?

            No attempt by the Greens at trailing their coat for a future coalition with the Labor Party, where no doubt they will come out and try to harm the economy and jobs again, will distract us from our job, which is to support Australians, protect people's health and protect people's livelihoods through this pandemic and to ensure we put in place a plan for the strongest possible economic and jobs recovery on the other side. That is what we are focused on.

              The point of order is on relevance. We're now two-thirds of the way through the minister's provided time to answer this question. The question was very clear. It was about prime ministerial standards and ministerial standards and whether Mr Sukkar would be stood down while the Prime Minister made that assessment. Minister Cormann has gone nowhere near the question.

               Senator McKim, you've reminded the minister of the second part of the question. It did have a preamble. The minister is allowed some discretion in being directly relevant to the preamble as well, but I've let you remind him of the point of the question.

                It is clearly a partisan, political question in relation to party organisational matters. It is interesting that in the middle of a pandemic a senator for Queensland is interested in internal party matters in the state of Victoria. I'll let the people of Queensland judge that at the next election. No doubt that is why the vote for the Greens is particularly weak in that particular—
