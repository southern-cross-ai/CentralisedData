        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and the Treasurer. Can the minister advise the Senate of the impact of removing the carbon tax on power, water and sewerage prices across Australia, including in remote communities?

         I thank Senator Canavan for that question. I can advise the Senate that the evidence is in. The removal of Labor's failed carbon tax has led to reductions in the cost of electricity, reductions in the cost of water and reductions in the cost of sewerage. Of course, Labor said it could not be done. Like they said we could not stop the boats, they said the carbon tax removal would not lead to price reductions. This is what
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
          Bill Shorten

         said on 17 July, the day the Senate voted to get rid of the carbon tax:

         alleged the carbon price cost them?
        </p>
        <p>
         The answer to that now is a resounding yes.

          Elcho Island
         </a>
         . I visited the Marthakal Badurru Workshop, and guess what. Even there there was evidence that the repeal of the carbon tax was bringing down the cost of electricity, bringing down the cost of water and bringing down the cost of sewerage. I am reading here from the sign that was put up at that particular workshop. Senator Dastyari has seen this picture because he went to my Facebook site to check it out. This is what it says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         On the 17 July 2014, the Federal Government announced the removal of the carbon tax, to be backdated to 1 July 2014. This change—
        </p>
        <p>
         and this is a very important point—

        <p class="italic">
         reduces your power, water and sewerage prices.
        </p>
        <p>
         And it goes on:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All customers billed from 1 August onwards will receive a bill that no longer includes carbon tax. If you were billed between 1 July and 31 July 2014, you would have received a bill that included carbon tax. If so, you will be refunded the carbon tax component in your next bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         And right across Australia—

               If Labor was re-elected to government, Labor would bring back the carbon tax, Labor would push up the cost of electricity again and Labor would push up the cost of water and the cost of sewerage again right across Australia, including for Indigenous communities in remote Australia. I make this prediction: in the lead-up to the next election, Mr Shorten will campaign and will go to the election promising, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Mr Shorten will go to the campaign—'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' They will use all sorts of weasel words—

                  If it looks like a carbon tax, if it hurts like the carbon tax, it is a carbon tax. Whether you call it a carbon price, whether you call it a floating price or whether you call it a fixed price—whatever the Labor Party choose to call it—whatever they bring back will hurt.

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the minister able to inform the Senate of any other plans to reintroduce taxes that have been abolished by this parliament?

                      Labor will bring back the carbon tax. Of course, Labor, if they were re-elected to government, would also bring back the mining tax. How do I know this? The Labor member for Perth is already campaigning to bring back the mining tax. Again, Mr Shorten is saying, 'Oh, well, you know, perhaps not in the same form', and, 'We made some mistakes, but we've still got to get a return.' He is going to put all sorts of language around it and all sorts of weasel words. Labor will bring back the mining tax, which will hurt the economy, hurt jobs, hurt investment and slow Australia down.

                      How do I know this? Here is former Treasurer Wayne Swan—remember him? Remember former Treasurer Wayne Swan, who spent all the money he thought the mining tax would raise and more? Guess what? He is still spending the money he thought the mining tax would raise. Here he was the other day on ABC 24 saying that the money from the mining tax could be invested, and I am quoting him here, 'in tax reform or supporting other elements of public policy, such as education'. He is still spending money from the tax—
