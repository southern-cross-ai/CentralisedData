         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         With reference to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper" rel="nofollow">
          White Paper
         </a>
         and the Strategic Reform Program 'Indicative Workforce Implications - Military Workforce', for the period 1 January to 30 June 2011:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Implementation of the efficiency improvements component of the Strategic Reform Program, which includes
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Shared Services
         </a>
         initiatives and business improvement within Groups and Services, has led to a reduction of 72 Average Funded Strength.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Civilianisation is part of the workforce reform element of Workforce Reform and Shared Services and forms part of Defence's move to establish the best mix of its non-combat-related workforce and to have the military workforce primarily undertake combat or combat related roles. Civilianisation requires the disestablishment of a military position, and the establishment and recruitment to an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service
         </a>
         position. Where the position is being filled by the military member moving to the Australian Public Service under Section 72, there is no discontinuity in the positions being established/ dis-established, and filled. In some cases the Australian Public Service position is filled (briefly) before the military position is dis-established in order to facilitate a hand-over of the role to an incoming Australian Public Service employee. In certain circumstances no hand-over by the current military member is required, and the military position is able to be dis-established prior to recruitment of the Australian Public Service position. In this year there has been a minor lag on the dis-establishment of military positions behind recruitment to the newly established Australian Public Service positions, resulting in a slight increase in Australian Public Service positions ahead of reduction in Average Funded Strength positions. A phased implementation has realised 126 Average Funded Strength reductions across the 2010/11 financial year.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) Implementation of the support productivity improvements component of the Strategic Reform Program is scheduled to commence in financial year 2014-15. This program is a continuous improvement plan, following on from the completed implementation of the other Workforce and Shared Services components of the Strategic Reform Program.
