         , I rise to make a point of clarification in respect of this division for people who were not in the chamber when I spoke just prior to the division being called. The government has given an assurance that this piece of legislation will not be called on today, in accordance with agreement between the opposition and the government. We understand that this piece of legislation is before a committee, and that committee should report to the parliament prior to it being considered. The basis of this division right now is that there is some concern that we may bring this on for debate today. I have made a statement to the chamber that that is not the case. We respect the processes of the parliament and we will not be bringing the legislation on for debate today—it is purely and simply receiving a message from the House of Representatives so that the legislation is introduced. It is the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. It is before a committee and it should go through that process before it comes to the chamber.

          , the opposition is not denying this bill a first reading. The opposition is only responding to the motion that the bill 'may proceed without formalities'. That is what we wish to vote against. The effect of that, as the minister knows, is that this bill can then be debated in the next session. If the minister is so concerned about adhering to what he has put to us, the opposition's position is entirely consistent with the procedure you have outlined, and I wonder why the government is opposing it.

           Order! We have had enough debate on this matter. The question is that these bills may proceed without formalities, be taken together and be now read a first time.

            , can I try and assist the chamber. I think what Senator McEwen asked was that that question be put separately only on the procedural element of the motion—so not the first reading. The only motion she sought to respond to was that these bills may proceed without formalities.
