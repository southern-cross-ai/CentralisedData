        Before asking that the motion is taken as formal, I wish to inform the chamber that Senators Brown and Griff have been added to the motion. I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 1364 standing in my name and the name of Senators Brown and Griff, for today relating to the establishment of a royal commission to investigate the violence, abuse and neglect of disabled people.

        Leave is granted.

           The government continues to support and recognise the significant contribution of Australians with disability. The government is also engaging in real, immediate and substantial reform to prevent the abuse and neglect of people with disabilities as we roll out the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           , the most significant social reform to improve choice and control for people with disabilities in the service that they receive. The government is providing $209 million over four years to establish the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, which will address issues raised in recent inquiries, replacing a complex and fragmented system of quality and safeguards in each state and territory with a single national consistent approach under the NDIS.
