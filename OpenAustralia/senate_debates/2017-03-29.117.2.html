           Private health insurance is important and valuable. Private health insurance reduces pressure on waiting times at hospitals; offers Australians greater choice of treatment; provides coverage of services, such as dental and optical; and gives patients their choice of doctor. The Turnbull government realises cost-of-living pressures are a major concern for Australian families. The government is determined that more can be done to get better value for families. The government has established the Private Health Ministerial Advisory Committee, led by Dr Jeff Harmer AO, which is already looking at ways to provide better value for money. Through this group, Minister Hunt will work with insurers over the next year to find ways insurers can deliver more value for customers without compromising on the quality of cover. As such, the government does not support using the Senate's limited resources for an additional inquiry.

              will be supporting this motion. As the chair of the committee, I would like to let the chamber know that the community affairs committee is very overworked. While we welcome all the inquiries that are referred to us, we want to let the chamber know that we will have difficulty processing this until the week after the budget. Senator Griff understands that, and I understand Labor does too. We will not be doing any work on this, with the acknowledgement of the chamber, until after budget week. Then, of course, it will be full steam ahead.
