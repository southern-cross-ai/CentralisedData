         (No. 1) 2014

        implements a measure announced in the 2014-15 Budget, and will pause the indexation arrangements for the income thresholds in the
        <i>
         Private Health Insurance Act 2007
        </i>
        for three years. The income thresholds contained in the
        <i>
         Private Health Insurance Act
        </i>
        are used in determining the tiers for both the Australian Government Rebate on private health insurance and the Medicare levy surcharge.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In this Budget, the Government increases overall spending and investment in health from $68 billion this year, to $71 billion next year, increasing again to $75 billion in 2016-17, and to $79 billion in 2017-18.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The changes contained within this legislation being introduced today are part of a broader pause in indexation rates across multiple portfolios announced in the 2014-15 Budget in an effort to help make spending sustainable and to repair the fiscal position left by the previous Labor Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments will see the income thresholds used to determine the private health insurance rebate and Medicare levy surcharge remain unchanged for three years, paused at the 2014-15 rates in 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill preserves the explicit link between the Rebate and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Levy_Surcharge" rel="nofollow">
         Medicare Levy Surcharge
        </a>
        . This is important as they operate together to ensure that people whose rebates are reduced because of means-testing have a strong incentive to retain their private health insurance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to note that these changes will not affect individuals with an income that remains below the 2014-15 base tier thresholds of $90,000, or couples and families with an income that remains $180,000 or below.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is estimated that only 4% of the 6.2 million private health insurance policies held as at December 2013 will be affected by this measure.

        has inherited an enormous debt, and these measures are just a small part of the Government's strategy to clean up the mess that the Labor left behind.
