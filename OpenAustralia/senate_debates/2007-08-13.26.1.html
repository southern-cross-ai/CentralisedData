        My question is to Senator Abetz, representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I refer the minister to recent reports that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Quarantine_and_Inspection_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service
        </a>
        testing has detected antimicrobial contamination in 31 out of 100 samples of imported fish and crustaceans from China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. Can the minister confirm that tests revealed unacceptable levels of flouroquinolones and other potentially harmful antibiotics? Hasn’t Australia’s medical profession expressed grave concern about the risk of antibiotic contamination in the food chain? When will the government match the United States and introduce 100 per cent testing for antibiotic contamination in imported seafood?

          AQIS
         </a>
         has routinely tested prawns and aquaculture fish from all countries for some antimicrobial compounds for several years. Imported seafood tested for those antimicrobials have shown above 95 per cent compliance. If consignments of imported seafood are found to contain antimicrobial residues, they are not allowed to enter the domestic market. In addition to routine testing, AQIS recently conducted a snapshot survey of imported seafood from all countries for a wider range of pesticides and antimicrobial compounds on samples taken between April 2006 and March 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of the survey was to check for a range of antibiotic and pesticide residues not included in the current testing program. AQIS received the results from the testing laboratory on 21 June 2007. They were collated and sent to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Australia_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          Food Standards Australia New Zealand
         </a>
         on 5 July 2007 for assessment. No pesticides were detected; however, the survey results showed that some imported seafood products contained antimicrobial residues not permitted in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. The antibiotic residues detected were at very low levels; however, they still represent a compliance breach of Australia’s food standards.
        </p>
        <p>
         The draft report of the survey results have also been provided to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
          National Health

         will form part of the final report. In the interim, AQIS will include a wide range of antimicrobial chemicals in its testing program for imported seafood. This will be implemented very shortly. The new testing requirements, which are based on the results of this survey, are a measured approach that reflects the Australian requirements and food safety standards.
        </p>
        <p>
         I remind the Senate that seafood is a health food that a lot of people are very anxious to partake of because of its overwhelming health benefits, and therefore we as a government are concerned to ensure that public confidence in seafood can be maintained. The science is overwhelming in relation to the benefits. What we want to do is to ensure that consumers are not turned off from seafood, which is overwhelmingly to their benefit, whilst also ensuring that imports in particular are monitored to ensure that consumers are protected from the matters that the honourable senator referred to.

           USFDA
          </a>
          has, from over a month ago, required 100 per cent testing of seafood products, particularly from China, when will this government act to follow their example? Can the minister confirm media reports that Minister McGauran has concealed the

           AQIS

          testing results since as far back as April last year? Given that the minister has known about the tests for perhaps as long as that, why has he failed to act? Doesn’t the minister’s failure to act have potentially grave health consequences for Australian consumers?

           I advise the honourable senator that, under the Imported Food Control Act 1992,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSANZ" rel="nofollow">
            FSANZ
           </a>
           and not the minister determines whether a type of food is classified as ‘risk’.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQIS" rel="nofollow">
            AQIS

           inspects risk food at a rate of 100 per cent of consignments, reducing over time if a history of compliance is demonstrated. Most seafood is not classified by FSANZ as risk food.

                 I will give it a third go: food not classified as risk food is tested for compliance with Australia’s food standards at the rate of five per cent of consignments. Where a consignment fails a test, subsequent consignments are tested at the rate of 100 per cent, whether the product is risk food or not, until a history of compliance is demonstrated.
