        Last week was a momentous occasion across Australia when we saw the Prime Minister announce the date for the referendum. This referendum to recognise Australia's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people in our Constitution through a Voice is something that we should all get behind. For years and years Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        people have been calling for exactly this—a voice, a recognition in our Constitution for their 65,000 years of culture and tradition, their love of the land and their care of our country. Yet what we are seeing quite significantly is misinformation being touted around the country to coerce people to say no.
       </p>
       <p>
        If people want to say no on the basis of the actual facts that's one thing, but to be pushed to it by misinformation is unconscionable, and people should feel deeply ashamed of that. And it's not just that. We then see the member for Dickson and Leader of the Opposition saying he wants to hold another referendum to recognise First Nations people in the Constitution—recognise them but not listen to them. If you say no to the idea of a referendum that has recognition in the Constitution and a Voice and then elect him as the Prime Minister, he'll hold another referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Constitution and give them no voice. It is a joke, a complete joke.

         HANSON-YOUNG () (): Last night the 'yes' campaign released their uplifting and powerful ad, celebrating Indigenous achievement and excellence. The ad compares and captures the landmark moments of progress as a united, intelligent, empathetic, modern Australia: when we voted yes in the 1967 referendum; when we cheered yes for

         ; when the High Court said yes to

          Eddie Mabo
         </a>
         ; when we said yes, we are sorry, to the stolen generations. These were uniting moments and ones that we are proud of as a nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         But what do we have from the side opposite? What does
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Dutton
         </a>
         appeal to? Does he really appeal to the best of us? He says, 'If you don't know, vote no.' He is appealing to ignorance and to fear. He speaks of division and he talks down to the Australian people. And, rather than debating the merits, he platforms mistruths, lies and conspiracy theories. This isn't just post-truth; this is pre-enlightenment. Where would Peter Dutton have been in these key moments? Would he have voted yes in the 1967 referendum? No. Would he have cheered for Cathy Freeman? Probably not. Did he support the apology? No, he didn't. Did he stand with Eddie Mabo? No, he didn't. I wonder where he would have been when people were campaigning to give women the right to vote. Let's face it, he would have been on the wrong side of that one, too. Every time Australia has moved forward, Peter Dutton has said 'no'. He has been on the wrong side every single time.
