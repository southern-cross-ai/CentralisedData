        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann, and I refer again to the inconsistency between the evidence given in the Federal Court by Minister Cash's former senior media adviser and the answers given by both this minister and Minister Keenan. I ask: when was the Prime Minister aware of these inconsistencies, and, if so, was it prior to question time?

             I'll take that question on notice too, but let me repeat this point. I think Senator Wong is getting into very dangerous territory here. The implication of her question is that because a statement is made by an individual in a court proceeding, somehow that becomes established fact. That is not the case.
            </p>

            <p>
             Senator Collins has just reflected on Senator Cash in an inappropriate fashion. It is of course established fact also that Senator Cash will be appearing as a subpoenaed witness in that same court on Friday. The proposition that the executive government should be providing a running commentary of statements by individual witnesses is completely inappropriate. Like all relevant ministers, both stand by the statements they've made on the public record, and the Prime Minister has full confidence in his ministers.

              Can the minister representing Mr Morrison explain how the actions of Minister Keenan and Minister Cash align with the obligations for ministers under the Statement of Ministerial Standards, which I referenced earlier: 'the lawful and disinterested exercise of statutory and other powers available to their office'?

                 . I wouldn't ordinarily make this point of order, but this minister, in his earlier statement, referred to me making inappropriate remarks. You fortunately ignored such a suggestion. But now he's talking about smear and innuendo he should be asked to withdraw.
