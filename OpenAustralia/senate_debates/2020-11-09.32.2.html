        , Senator Birmingham. I refer to alarming reports that Chinese authorities have taken the unilateral decision to ban some Australian exports. Can the minister advise the Senate of the total value of exports to China and how many Australian jobs rely on that market?

         I thank Senator Wong for her question, a question that is on a topic of significant importance to Australia, to many Australian industries and to the jobs of many Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         China is Australia's No. 1 trading partner. It's an important trading partner, and we value what has been a longstanding relationship of mutual benefit to both of our economies. In terms of current estimates around trade volumes, the value of those volumes and the associated jobs, I'll happily come back to the chamber with details on thoseâ€”with up-to-date estimates. But it is of great consequence, as I've noted, that our No. 1 trading partner has, in the course of this year, taken a number of decisions that have adverse potential consequences for Australian industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a government we have been very clear about our disappointment over a decision in relation to Australia's barley growers that has seen China put in place tariffs which we don't believe are justified. Australia's farming sector in no way is subsidised by government or dumps its product on foreign markets such as China. Nor do we believe that China's specific actions when it comes to the suspension of certain meat-processing facilities are justified for the length of time that it has decided on. And now we are concerned that we are seeing decisions in relation to the processing of live seafood that mean it is taking longer than should be the case. However, equally, we see many rumours, stories and areas of speculation that proved to be unfounded. Suggestions of complete, outright bans on Australian trade entering China do not appear to have materialised over recent days, but we continue to work through diplomatic and administrative channels to make sure that Australian exporters get answers where they can and access where they ought.

            I have written to my counterpart on a number of occasions about a number of the issues that I just outlined. We have also made representations in addition to those written ones that I have made, as is publicly known, seeking ministerial dialogue, and it is a disappointment to Australia that, despite our willingness to sit down and engage as a mature partner in ministerial dialogue, China has been unwilling to reciprocate. Nonetheless, we retain a position and a posture of keeping the door open in that regard, and we will continue to ensure that that invitation is extended and our willingness to do so is there. In addition to those representations that I have made directly, as a government we have continued at ambassadorial level and at other diplomatic levels to engage solidly, steadfastly, to try to resolve the various technical issues and other issues, as well as to support Australian industry wherever we possibly can.

               That really is a question for China. I note that Chinese authorities have denied the suggestion of there being an outright ban in relation to certain export products from Australia entering China. They have made those denials both in private and, through their media spokespeople, in public.
              </p>
              <p>
               I note, as I said in answer to the primary question, that we have seen over the last few days shipments in a number of areas still proceed through customs, and we hope to see that continueâ€”that China is true to its word, which it has given publicly and privately that there is not such an intervention, and does continue to allow trade to flow in accordance with commitments that China has made under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and in accordance with the commitments that China has made as a member of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" rel="nofollow">
                World Trade Organization

               . Trade between our two nations is beneficial to people across both our nations and across our region. It's beneficial to people and businesses within China as well, and any disruption will harm them as much as it will us.
