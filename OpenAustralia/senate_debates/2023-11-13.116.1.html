        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. Data from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        for the June quarter reveals that Australian's spending fell while new-arrival's spending increased, because the number of new arrivals increased. Minister, the government's policy of bringing so many new arrivals to shore up domestic demand is acting against the Reserve Bank's low-inflation strategy. Why do you have your foot on the accelerator while the Reserve Bank has its foot on the brake?

         I thank Senator Roberts for the question. I disagree with it, and I don't accept that we are not working alongside the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         . They have their job to do, which is to bring inflation back within the target band without crunching the economy. We have our job to do, which is to implement our economic plan and roll out, as I said before, the cost-of-living relief to get the budget in much better shape, which we have done, and to make much overdue investments into energy, skills and housing across the country, which are causing pressure in other areas of the economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the population growth, or what we've been seeing from the net overseas migration numbers in particular—we've spoken about this in this place on a number of times—we are seeing some of the results of having our borders closed, essentially, for a couple of years. So we're seeing people returning to this country, particularly international students to study, at a time when we're not seeing as many leaving the country. We are seeing that, and that's reflected in the budget numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I can absolutely guarantee, Senator Roberts, that we are working with the Reserve Bank. The decisions that we take are about not making their job harder. It's an already difficult job that they are doing, and our job is to support that in the areas that we have responsibility for, which is to deal with that cost-of-living relief, to get the budget in much better shape, which we have done, and to invest in the productive side of our economy into things like the energy transition, skills and housing, which are areas that were left neglected after a decade—

            I would just say that we have not changed the policy settings that were in place around net overseas migration, so your characterisation is incorrect. In response to some of the economic data you cite, yes, we are seeing moderation in a couple of areas, and that is because many Australians are doing it tough right now, and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
             Reserve Bank
            </a>
            is trying to lower demand with some of the decisions that they've been taking. So, yes, we are seeing that translate into other areas of economic data, but I would also say to the senator, who voted against the Housing Australia Future Fund, that our housing policies are about dealing with this long-term underinvestment and failure to acknowledge that the Commonwealth government has a role to support the construction and delivery of social and affordable housing. That is the area the Commonwealth neglected in the previous decade. We have a range of policies targeted to housing to address—

              Talking misinformation about your housing bill won't save this government. Everyday Australians know they can't afford their rent or mortgage, and they know your government is swamping the country with even more arrivals. Minister, why are you papering over your economic mismanagement and running an immigration Ponzi scheme?

               That question is simply incorrect. I would say that there is a huge amount of work that's being done by the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
                Home Affairs
               </a>
               minister and the immigration minister to fix the broken system that we inherited, and we'll have more to say on that shortly as the work that they are doing is finalised. But it's simply not true to allege what you are alleging. We have inherited a migration system that the minister herself has said is broken, so we are dealing with issues to fix that.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, in relation to some of the numbers that we've been seeing, particularly in relation to international students and working holiday-makers who have returned to the country with valid visas after the borders had been closed, just because you say 'misinformation' doesn't mean it is misinformation. These are the facts; let's deal with the facts. We accept that there is pressure in the housing market, which is why we're responding to deal with it.
