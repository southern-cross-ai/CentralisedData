        I am a bit nervous. I may need protection because my question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Senator Cash! Can the minister confirm that today the

        of the Federal Court has ruled that the minister's determination on work rights in the off-shore oil and gas industry is invalid, finding the minister's actions were 'not authorised', 'invalid' and 'sought to reverse the parliament's intentions'.

         Yes, I can confirm that today the full bench of the Federal Court did uphold the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">
          MUA
         </a>
         's appeal. We are currently considering the decision.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Sterle, if you want to come in here and be proud of your side's efforts to close down the offshore oil and gas industry then, quite frankly, you should hang your head in shame, because those of us on this side of the chamber will take every step that we can to ensure that one of the most productive industries—not just in this country, but globally—is able to do business.
        </p>
        <p>
         Look at the offshore oil and gas industry. This accounts, in terms of the Australian economy—Senator Sterle, let me give you a lesson, which your mates in the MUA clearly have not given you—for 2½ per cent of gross domestic product, generating $28 billion a year in revenue. On this side we want to ensure that they are able to continue to generate those levels of money and, if possible, to increase. The sector, Senator Sterle—through you,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         —employs 2,500 people, and it is estimated that the number of flow-on jobs is at least 10,000.
        </p>
        <p>
         What those on the other side just do not understand is that if you take steps to destroy this industry your people will lose their jobs. I am actually taking steps to try and protect the jobs of those in the MUA. Everything you are doing, Senator Sterle, is completely contrary to that, and you should hang your head in shame.

            My point is, perhaps, to assist. The quotes were 'invalid', 'not authorised' and 'sought to reverse the parliament's intention'. If you rule that we should repeat those rather than 'unlawful', so be it.

So, Senator Sterle, seriously, if you do not want to listen to me—and it is fine if you do not—why don't you pick up the phone and speak to the former minister for resources, Martin Ferguson? He will give you a lesson in what your mates in the

                    , I rise on a point of order on direct relevance to the question. Could you redirect the minister's attention to the question.

                      All I can say is that we on this side of the chamber will take the steps necessary to ensure that one of the most profitable industries in this country is able to continue to operate in this country. If those on the other side want to stick up for their union mates, that is their decision. But I can tell you that sticking up for your union mates will actually endanger jobs within the sector.
