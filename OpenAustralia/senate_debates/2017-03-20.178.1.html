        I have a number of questions for the minister before amendments are dealt with. I make reference, perhaps as a reference point, to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's report on this bill. The minister's second reading speech on the bill explained:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The review—
       </p>
       <p>
        the

        review, as it is known, into the Interactive Gambling Act—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        found that the amount of money being spent on illegal wagering services could be as high as $400 million annually with a further $100 million in lost taxation revenue and product fees.
       </p>
       <p>
        There does not seem to be any firm view on the amount of money actually lost. Some figures you hear are $500 million and other figures go much higher than that. Does the Commonwealth have the ability to be more specific about these figures? For instance, if it obtained the cooperation of banks in terms of other mechanisms of measuring the amount that goes offshore—because presumably most of these transactions are occurring using credit cards and other discernible transactions—surely there ought to be some way of measuring more accurately the extent of the problem of these illegal offshore gambling sites.

         You have indicated the sorts of ranges that are spoken of when talking about these dollar amounts. Obviously, there is always a capacity for greater specificity in these things, but you raise some potential avenues for that.

          Senator Dastyari is familiar with who I am referring to. Has the government considered measures to more accurately measure the amount of money that goes to illegal wagering services? For instance, has the government inquired of the banks or financial institutions to determine by virtue of the merchant numbers for these illegal, overseas, online gambling operations, to determine the amount lost in that way? Has an effort been made? Has anyone in the Commonwealth, whether it be

            The Interactive Gambling Act has been in force since 2001. I remember it well, having lobbied for its passage all those years ago as a state member of parliament, walking up and down the corridors talking to crossbenchers and to Senator Alston as the minister. Are you saying that, in the 16 years this bill has been enforced, including its prohibition of illegal, overseas online gambling operations, there has been no attempt to determine with some degree of specificity and some degree of rigor the amount of money actually lost to these online sites? If so, why not? If the government is planning to do it now, what actual measures will it take to do so? For instance, will it require cooperation from the banks and financial institutions to determine this once and for all?

              I am not trying to be difficult on this; I just think it is important the people of Australia know what the extent is of the offshore, illegal sites problem. The government says it is considering further research. Reference was made to it in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Farrell" rel="nofollow">
               O'Farrell
              </a>
              review, and I was fortunate enough to sit down with Mr O'Farrell as part of that review and give him my views and that was fed into the report, but it does not seem to be the case that there are any measures to deal with this. My colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore refers to page 150 of the O'Farrell review which says:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Commonwealth, State and Territory governments should recommit to Gambling Research Australia to ensure that research funds are directed towards maximising the information available to policy makers, academics, the community and industry about the nature, prevalence and impact of gambling across Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is a very broad recommendation, but what concrete, practical, rigorous measures is the government proposing to determine the level of offshore gambling?
             </p>
             <p>
              There is an estimate of $500 million. For all we know, it could be $1 billion. It could be $200 million or any figure that you could pluck out of thin air. Surely, if it is expected that the vast majority of these transactions occur with credit cards or can be discernible and traceable through banks and financial institutions and credit card providers, then surely we should—I am just trying to understand if the government is prepared to commit to going down that path. Presumably there might be some people using bitcoins. We can probably guess or estimate how many people would be using bitcoins, but I imagine it would be a very small part of it. I think it is not unreasonable to ask, after 16 years of the operation of this act, to understand where that figure of $400 million comes from. What rigor would be employed to determine once and for all, with some degree of specificity, how much is actually being lost to these offshore sites?

               review indicated that losses are between the range of $64 million and $400 million. I have already indicated that the Commonwealth will be looking to commission further research. Senator Xenophon, your propositions as to how to help achieve the most accurate figure are, of course, ones that are very welcome.

And can he advise that there have not been any prosecutions under the Interactive Gambling Act at all after 16 years of operation?

                  Minister, in relation to the 140-odd complaints that have been referred by

                  , what happens to those complaints now that ACMA has greater enforcement and compliance powers? Are they able to revisit those complaints themselves, or will a separate mechanism need to be employed in order for those complaints to be assessed by ACMA in light of their new powers?

                    Further to Senator Kakoschke-Moore's question: even if a matter is still within time, could it be revisited? Subsequent to that, what does the government say is the time limit for these complaints? In other words: will this legislation only apply to offences from the date it is enacted? What happens to those offences that occurred before the passage of this bill, before the royal assent for this bill?

                     I guess civil provisions, which the legislation seeks to put in place, cannot apply until they are legislated, and it is not usual for legislation introducing new penalties and provisions to reach back.

                          That should be on a fridge magnet, Minister! I know laws come into effect when laws come into effect, but are you saying that for matters that occurred prior to the passage of this bill, the royal assent of this bill, the existing penalty provisions are extant? Or does it mean that it is not retrospective in the sense that the offence is still there, but there is a different penalty regime that applies at the time you make the complaint? I am just trying to understand how that would work. I do not want to labour the point any more than this, but it is important to make that clear for the constituents that we have that approach us about these problems.

                              Yes. I think I did criminal procedure in 1981. Minister Tudge, in his contribution in the House of Representatives, said on 10 November 2016:

We have heard from the Financial Counselling Australia report that I referred to, that Senator Roberts very articulately referred to, about the devastating effects on people's lives as a result of the enormous losses they have sustained. What assurances do we have that we are not going to be revisiting this bill in 16 years time, when I am long gone from this place, when the minister may still be here as the grey eminence of the Senate—

I am not being critical of the AFP per se, but it seems that this has not been a priority for them, particularly when you consider that lives have been ruined because of these offshore illegal sites. Of course, they have been by the legal sites as well, but it is the illegal sites that we are looking at now.

                                          We understand that the bill currently before the Senate deals with online and, in particular, offshore gaming. A couple of weeks ago, a bill introduced by my colleague Senator Xenophon, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Sports Betting Reform) Bill 2015, was the subject of a public hearing in Melbourne. Evidence during that committee by Tabcorp showed that they are in fact rolling out land-based electronic betting terminals to spring and autumn racing carnivals and that those terminals, in fact, already exist in some sports stadiums across Australia.

                                          The Nick Xenophon Team has some serious concerns in relation to these terminals. I understand it is separate to the bill being considered here to a certain degree; but given the harm that we know is caused by online sports betting and online gambling, can you advise whether or not the government is looking at incorporating the consideration of harm minimisation measures relating to land-based gambling as part of the national consumer protection framework that is currently under discussion?

                                            Given that the harms caused by gambling, whether pokies or online gambling, are largely the same—in that there are devastating consequences for a person's finances, possibly for their marriage and for their ability to pay their mortgage—and that the government is in active consideration of a national consumer protection framework, why then aren't land-based betting services and harm minimisation techniques applicable to those services currently under consideration?

                                              I will just go back to the issue of the new burden of proof. It will be a balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt, and it will be dealt with by

                                              . Given that there could well be a flood of complaints if it seems that there is more of a prospect that there will be action taken, what additional resources are being provided to ACMA to deal with what could be a significant number of complaints? If there is an actual flood of complaints, given the number of people who are hurt by these illegal offshore gambling sites, will the government undertake to make sure that these matters are dealt with and that complaints are not abandoned by virtue of a lack of resources on the part of ACMA?

                                                  Okay, you cannot tell me what is the budget. Do you know what is in the budget? In relation to these matters, if you are looking at fining an offshore gambling operation—if it is Malta, Gibraltar, somewhere in the Caribbean or wherever they may be; I am not sure of this Uzbekistan is big on online gambling, and I apologise to the Uzbekistan if they are not—does the government say that they have the ability to pursue those companies and to obtain any monetary penalties from them given that they are based overseas? What undertakings will the government be able to obtain from those countries where these online gambling operations are based?

                                                  In some cases they may have an office in a place like the United Kingdom or a European country, but they are based in another jurisdiction. Trying to obtain a prosecution fine from these companies that have all sorts of complex and labyrinthine arrangements—has that been factored into the sorts of resources that

                                                     Well, there are many countries in the world. There will probably be the need to go through what the individual relationships are between Australia and each jurisdiction. I should also mention that we do have—as you know, Senator—as part of this legislation the capacity to notify the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of people who may be directors in these foreign countries, to place them on an alert list. There are also other disruptive measures. The amendments also extend the ambit of enforcement to affiliates and agents. Someone illegal operators engage a network of Australian-based agents and affiliates to recruit customers, so there is a greater capacity to deal with these individuals.

                                                     But you are right: the fact that some activities take place in foreign countries where there might not necessarily be those sorts of relationships with other agencies can prove to be an issue. But Australia is always working on ensuring that we have those good relationships where we can with partner agencies overseas.

                                                        I know that my colleague, Senator Kakoschke-Moore, will move an amendment in due course in relation to what many consider to be a loophole in the bill—scope for it to be strengthened in relation to the whole issue of in-play betting. Does the government concede that it would be easy to circumvent the proposed ban on in-play betting by the exemptions that the government itself has, in effect, facilitated in this bill?

                                                            The minister made reference in his closing remarks on the bill that there is going to be a national consumer protection framework in respect of online gambling. There were many recommendations made in the
                                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Farrell" rel="nofollow">
                                                             O'Farrell

I know that Senator Roberts did outline a number of cases from that report that were quite horrendous stories of people who had lost life savings, who had been devastated financially and who had their lives ruined by sports betting. And this was legal sports betting.

Will it be a case of Commonwealth legislation or will it be a case of state-based template legislation with other Commonwealth legislation? I think the concern is that the O'Farrell review did do some genuinely good work—I think it should have gone further, but it did do some good work to deal with these issues—you have had the report of Financial Counselling Australia and you are aware of the previous reports that the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform did back in the time of the Gillard government. What does the minister say will be the progress of that national consumer protection framework that so many in the community are so anxious to be progressed and implemented?

It will then be for the Commonwealth and the states and territories to finalise the details of that for a final decision later in the year. The time frame will depend on the implementation model that is chosen, so I cannot give you a definitive date at this time, but I can tell you that the intention and the objective is to reach agreement on 31 March on the national framework. The implementation and what legislation may be required and in which parliaments are matters to be determined.

I am not sure whether it will be a combination of state and Commonwealth legislation. If it is going to be a combination of state and Commonwealth legislation, does the government concede that it clearly has the constitutional power, using corporations power, external affairs powers or banking and telecommunications powers to regulate this at a Commonwealth level, effectively, rather than what could be a lowest common denominator with the approach that we are now seeing?

I cannot pre-empt what the model will be and which legislative avenues will be pursued in which parliaments. Let me reassure you that Minister Tudge, who will be at that meeting, is extremely focused from the Commonwealth's point of view, as am I, in bringing this framework to fruition.

'Developing a self-exclusion register' does not mean it will be implemented. I am worried that the wording of the O'Farrell review, whilst well intended, is quite vague. If it is only going as far as that, it could be that we get recommendations to discourage something but that it does not actually have any legislative teeth to do some good in terms of reducing consumer harm.

In many jurisdictions in respect of poker machines, the rationale is quite simple: if you give someone credit while they are chasing their losses, that can feed gambling addiction, and that is something that ought to be prohibited. It is a basic and fundamental consumer protection measure.

I believe we need to go much further, but this is a good start, because banning credit betting will go some way towards preventing those operators from offering credit betting, which can fuel gambling addiction.

The betting agency involved eventually did the right thing. The person had lost their home, and they were declared bankrupt, as I recollect. We ended up getting the bankruptcy reversed and the person's home returned, including stamp duty being paid. But that was driven by credit betting. There were real questions there about the capacity of that person to make those bets, and that was why we were able to reverse that transaction, that very traumatic set of circumstances. I still get Christmas cards all these years later from the mother of the person involved, who lives in Melbourne. This is a live issue. It is a big issue, and I would urge all my colleagues to support this.

Fewer people will go broke, fewer people will go bankrupt and fewer people will lose their homes. Credit betting should not be allowed under any circumstances. What is there to consider or consult about? It is rapacious conduct on the part of gambling operators to offer credit betting, particularly to people who have no prospect of paying it back unless they end up selling their assets. I would urge the government to reconsider its position. I know that my colleague Senator O'Neill wishes to contribute to the debate.
