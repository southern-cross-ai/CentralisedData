        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Watt. Your government has a policy position to ban the live export in sheep. In June 2022 you said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … there are some real opportunities to expand sheep processing and expand exports of chilled frozen meat, including sheep.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

        in a bagged carcass market relies heavily on passenger flights out of Perth. Minister, how will your government expand chilled meat exports to the Middle East if you won't approve additional passenger flights from Perth to the Middle East?

         Thank you, Senator Brockman. I'm glad that, at last, someone from the opposition has asked a question about agriculture in question time. I think February was the last time anyone in the opposition asked a question about agriculture.
        </p>

         An honourable senator: But not the National Party.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not the National party. So well done to the Liberal Party for taking an interest in agriculture. Senator Brockman, I know this is an issue you have a deep interest in. As you are probably aware, I met today and yesterday with delegations of sheep producers from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , which I think probably takes to well over a dozen now the number of times that I've met with representatives of the sheep industry, the export industry and all other parts of the supply chain. As I've said from the very first time I met with those representatives, about three weeks after the election, we will be delivering our election commitment, but we will be doing it in an orderly way, based on advice from the independent panel that I appointed to provide advice and recommendations on how and over what time frame that transition should occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know, having met with the panel again recently, which no-one over there has done, that these are matters that the panel is giving consideration to. The panel is giving consideration to these very issues. The panel is giving consideration to how this policy should be implemented.

           On a point of order, the question is actually about the minister's statements in regard to the export of carcass meat to the

              Senator Farrell, you called a point of order in good faith and then you went to a debating point. In relation to your point of order, Senator Canavan, there was a preamble to the question that did mention banning the live sheep trade. I will listen to the response from the minister and, if necessary, direct him to the last part of Senator Brockman's question.

                 It's interesting that the opposition is taking an interest in the live sheep export industry, given that industry declined by about 70 per cent when the coalition were in power.

                   n agricultural industry, which is already being hurt by your government's decision to end Australia's live sheep trade. Producers are already seeing lower prices. Confidence has plummeted. Sheep producer Charles Wass recently sold a flock of ewes for $20 a head, leaving him a $10 margin. He would normally need $80 to keep his business viable. Minister, why is this government insisting on shutting down this industry?

                    that this is a policy that the government took to an election not just once but twice. We didn't win the election the first time we took this policy to an election, but we did the second time. I think it's important that governments keep their promises, and that's what we're doing. What you are asking us to do is to break an election commitment, and we're not going to do that.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The question was: why are we doing this? That is why we are doing this; we are implementing an election commitment that we were voted in to deliver, and that's what we're doing. But we are going to do it in an orderly way, in consultation with the industry. I look forward to receiving the panel's recommendation about how and in what way we should implement this policy.

                      Minister, considering Premier Cook has now come out against your government's decision to protect Qantas's profits at the expense of Australian farmers wanting to sell their sheep, will you fight for the sheep farmers in Wagin, Cranbrook, Kojonup, Katanning, Beverley, Williams and Darkan, or will you turn your back on them again?

                       As I say, this government takes its election commitments seriously, and that's what we're doing; we're implementing that commitment. Senator Brockman, I assume that you've also been honest with those sheep producers about the fact that the number of live sheep exported from

                       fell by 70 per cent when the coalition was in power. I assume you've pointed that out to them. I assume you've pointed out the comments that your Liberal Party deputy leader,

I recall she labelled the live sheep export trade as 'inhumane', which are comments that I've never made about that industry. I assume that you've presented a balanced opinion on these matters.
