        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. The Minister for Defence was asked in the other place yesterday to confirm that Australia's future nuclear powered submarines were safe, and he answered, 'The short answer to the honourable member's question is that it will be safe to serve on a nuclear powered submarine.' I welcome this clarification, and I seek confirmation that you agree with the defence minister that nuclear submarines are safe for Australia's submariners, as well as those who will build them and maintain them.

           No, mate. You're wrong. I don't respect the way your party is choosing to bring up the AUKUS endeavour in a vain attempt to shore up your energy plan, which is risky, expensive, uncosted and a consequence of the anti-renewables obsession of your leader. I am, and have been since we were briefed in opposition, an advocate for AUKUS—in my party, publicly and in the country. I have made clear our support for the project and our belief in the safety of this technology in nuclear submarines, operating as it has in the Virginia class and others for decades. But to try and bring AUKUS, the biggest endeavour this country has ever engaged in, into a pathetic political fight, in an attempt to shore up a policy that you're embarrassed by, is really the height of hypocrisy. It really is. It is beneath, frankly, the dignity of some on that side who understand the importance of AUKUS and the importance of bipartisanship.

                  and also by the future fleet of submarines, will you or the Prime Minister now direct Labor members of parliament to cease undermining the confidence of Australian people in nuclear technology with their reckless social media messages, including the depiction of Australian cartoon characters with three eyes?

                   It says something about the coalition that they're more worried about some social media memes than about ensuring that national security is above politics.
