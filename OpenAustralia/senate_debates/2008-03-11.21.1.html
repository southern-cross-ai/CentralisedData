        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Minister, given the Prime Minister’s assertion that he will crack down on MP consultancies and work outside of parliament, does the minister think it is appropriate for a member of parliament to appear in advertisements promoting their own business?

         What we have seen in recent days is a debate about the appropriate line between parliamentarians performing their official functions and their engagement in other functions unrelated to their role as parliamentarians. It is a debate that has seen the public very strongly of the view that we ought to see parliamentarians working full time on their responsibilities and that they keep a very clear demarcation between business or other activity and their role as parliamentarians. I know Mr Vaile was the subject of much publicity surrounding his activities. So it is important, and that is why the Labor Party is very much committed to accountability measures. Senator Faulkner is working very hard on a whole range of initiatives concerning lobbyists, ministerial accountability, freedom of information—a whole range of measures that seek to provide greater transparency and greater accountability.

         We have had, as you know, declarations of interest by senators and members for some time now. That has been a very useful development. A few of our senators, particularly on the other side, have fallen foul of that over the years. I think now there is a much greater understanding by senators of their obligations in terms of declarations of interest. These are issues that are very much at the forefront of public debate. It is appropriate that politicians act appropriately and that we are clear that there is a declaration—

             Order, Senator Abetz! I do not need that advice. The minister is generally answering the context of your question, Senator Ronaldson, and I think he should be allowed to continue. But I would remind the minister of the question.

               I am not aware of what he is referring to, so I cannot comment on that. But I think it is important that everyone in the parliament focus on the importance of accountability and also focus on their responsibilities as elected members of parliament and that they choose to be very careful if they are to not apply themselves full time to their duties as parliamentarians. My personal view is that we ought to be very careful about potential conflicts of interest.

                         , what I indicated to you was that the Labor government would have accepted the tabling if the normal courtesies had been shown. If the senator shows it to the Government Whip and if it is what he claims it to be and it is in order, we will allow him permission to table it. He is well aware of the courtesies involved in these matters. I always try and facilitate senators tabling if possible. As long as the normal courtesies are applied, then that matter should be easily resolved.

                           Look, there is nothing really I can add. I am not aware of the charge. I am not sure there will be any substance to the claims made by the senator. His allegation that there is an ad and then somehow that it follows that government resources have been used I think is a pretty long bow. But, as I say, there are other ways for the senator to raise these issues if he wants to bring it forward in the parliament.
