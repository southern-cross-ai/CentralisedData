         Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Act 2012
        </i>
        (TPS Levies Act) and the
        <i>
         Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000
        </i>
        to enable the Minister for Education and Training to reduce the administrative and base fee components of the Tuition Protection Service (TPS) levy paid by Commonwealth registered international education providers by legislative instrument.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reserves in the Overseas Students Tuition Fund (the Fund) have been growing faster than expected due to sustained growth in overseas student enrolments, which has not been offset by a similar proportion of claims on the Fund. The Fund is expected to meet its upper reserve target of $50 million (set by the TPS Advisory Board) within the next two years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The TPS Director has already reduced the risk rated premium in order to slow the growth of the Fund. Further reductions to the risk rated premium are not a feasible mechanism to slow the growth in levy collections because a price signal needs to be maintained for higher risk providers. It is preferable to give the Government flexibility to manage the Fund, by providing the Minister a mechanism, by legislative instrument, to adjust the settings to the administrative and base fees to reward the international education sector overall for years of stability and growth, and allow providers to redirect funds for other purposes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The TPS Advisory Board and the Australian Government Actuary (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGA" rel="nofollow">
         AGA
        </a>
        ) have indicated the desirability of a reduction in the administrative and base fees. This will ensure the Fund remains within the target range of $30 million to $50 million recommended by the AGA and endorsed by the TPS Advisory Board. The reduction will not affect protections for international students or Australia's reputation for high quality education, as there will be sufficient reserves in the Fund to meet claims each year and in case of any unforeseen events or major provider closures.

        Reasons for Urgency

       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has committed to reducing the TPS levy for the 2018 collection period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of the bills in the 2017 Spring sittings is necessary so that the Minister can meet the 31 December 2017 deadline for making an instrument under the TPS Levies Act to reduce the levy in time for the 2018 levy collection.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If these amendments are not passed in the 2017 Spring sittings, it is unlikely the instrument could be made by the Minister in time for the 2018 levy collection. This would mean another year of no relief for low risk providers including universities,

       <p class="italic">
        If these processes are not completed by 17 November 2017, Australia's resourcing commitment to the IMF under the New Arrangements to Borrow may be hindered. Given Australia's strong public support for maintaining the resources of the IMF, this would harm Australia's credibility and standing.

        Bills will establish a national framework to set standards for emissions of air pollutants from a range of sources that are currently unregulated in Australia. The first products to have standards applied will be outdoor equipment and marine outboards that contribute to poor air quality in urban areas. Standards for other product emission sources will be considered in line with future government priorities for action on air pollutants. This measure supports the National Clean Air Agreement and the cities agenda.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In December 2015, State, Territory and Commonwealth Environment Ministers agreed to introduce emission standards for small petrol engines through Commonwealth legislation. In December 2016 the Australian Government announced that from 1 July 2018 all small petrol engines brought into the Australian market must be certified as meeting the standards. Passage in the 2017 Spring sittings will allow Rules to be made in late 2017, which will provide the industry enough time to ensure the products they are importing are compliant by 1 July 2018.
