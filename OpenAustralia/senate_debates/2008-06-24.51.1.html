        The Prime Minister has announced that Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        will be sworn as Governor-General on 5 September 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The salary of the Governor-General is laid down in the Act and, by operation of the
        <i>
         Constitution
        </i>
        , cannot be varied during the term in office.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In line with convention, the Governor-General’s salary has been calculated to exceed moderately the estimated average salary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Justice
        </a>
        of the High Court of Australia over the notional term of the appointment (in the case of Ms Bryce, five years).  In calculating the salary, regard was had, in line with precedent, to the pension that Ms Bryce expects to receive from the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To enable the salary to be set in time, the Governor-General Amendment (Salary and Superannuation) Bill 2008 must pass both Houses and receive

         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill amends the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 to establish two agencies under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Management" rel="nofollow">
         Financial Management

         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Introduction and passage of the bill in the 2008 Winter sittings will enable passage prior to 30 June 2008, thereby ensuring that the enhanced governance arrangements for both Boards are implemented from 1 July 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new governance arrangements involve the transfer of financial assets and liabilities and reporting obligations which need to commence from the start of a financial year.  If the bill is not passed during the 2008 Winter sittings, the new arrangements will not be able to commence until 1 July 2009.
