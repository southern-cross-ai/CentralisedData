        <p>
         A recent report by Access Economics found that the national high-speed broadband network will positively impact our economic performance and lead to economy-wide productivity growth that would be 1.1 per cent higher after 10 years compared to what it would be if the network were not built. A report by the Centre for International Economics in November 2008 said that broadband could lift national economic output by 1.4 per cent after five to six years. This is equivalent to $15 billion in

         The Rudd government understands that its investment in the National Broadband Network will create jobs and drive productivity today and into the future. It will create new efficiencies and sustainability. It will improve the availability of emerging services and applications in areas such as health care and education. It will position Australia to take advantage of the global recovery when it comes. Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition—

           Yes, it is possible to outline some of the reaction from the industry, but that would be in stark contrast to what those opposite have said. The Leader of the Opposition said he was happy that he could already download his movies in one to two seconds. That was the entire thinking behind the position of those opposite on this: ‘I am happy I can download my movies fast enough. Don’t worry about everybody else; don’t worry about regional Australia. In Wentworth I can download my movies as fast as I want them.’ It is fair to say that the reaction of the industry to the

            I thank the minister for his answer so far, and I ask a further supplementary question. On 6 February 2009, prior to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
             National Broadband Network
            </a>
            announcement, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull, stated:

           <p class="italic">
            … the infrastructure that will give you the best return is economic infrastructure that will make the economy more efficient, more productive and you know grow more strongly. … that is investment in communications …
           </p>
           <p>
            Can the minister therefore advise the Senate if investment in productive economic infrastructure like high-speed broadband is widely recognised as a critical way to ensure Australia’s prosperity?

                NBN
               </a>
               announcement, Mr Turnbull backflipped, criticising the government for investing in high-speed broadband infrastructure and describing the NBN as a monumental policy failure. So now the opposition appear to agree with investment in productive infrastructure but oppose investment in high-speed broadband. In his speech to the
