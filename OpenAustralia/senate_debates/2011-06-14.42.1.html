         say, though, that the government is determined to reform the live animal export industry, unlike those opposite, who seem stuck in the past. With proper, well-managed reform, the live export trade can transition to a sustainable industry where animal welfare outcomes and trade certainty are assured, because failure to reform the way in which Australia conducts this trade places in jeopardy the significant social and economic benefits that it brings to regional communities, particularly those regional communities of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         . It is disappointing to see that those opposite do not want to bring the trade back online as quickly as possible, to ensure animal welfare outcomes are maintained and to make sure that we have facilities that are appropriate and that meet
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OIE" rel="nofollow">
          OIE
         </a>
         standards.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is surprising that you then ask whether I have visited an abattoir or not. You seem to miss the point that it is about ensuring that we have animal welfare outcomes to resume this trade. We should not recommence this trade without that standard in place to ensure animal welfare outcomes. If those opposite are urging that we resume the trade without those safeguards in place then it is negligent to do so. You will also not be able to guarantee the animal welfare outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is particularly important to ensure that we maintain this industry. Of course, the industry bodies that have led us to this circumstance have failed their own producers, have failed to be able to provide assurances to their industry that they can continue this trade in a responsible way.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister's admission of not having expertise in this particular area of his portfolio, has the minister ever visited a working Australian abattoir? If so, when, where and what animals were being slaughtered? Upon what does the minister base his expectations of humane practices in slaughtering Australian cattle?

           I have had the opportunity of visiting a meatworks. I can certainly go into describing the circumstances and the time, but partly I think the opposition are simply playing politics with this issue. Dinmore meatworks is an area which I have visited and spoken to the industry about. Also not only the domestic market; I have been working with industry, both with the Meat Industry Council and the other representative bodies that I have described, on a couple of major important issues which are significant to those industries and those abattoirs that are domestic, which include export certification. But what I am disappointed about is that the opposition's approach to this is not about supporting animal welfare outcomes so that the trade can continue. What they are about is trying to score cheap political points on animal welfare issues. It is critical that weâ€”

Upon what direct practical or working knowledge of IndonÂ­esian or Australian abattoirs has the minister based his actions thus far, or are his actions based purely upon television footage supplemented by the advice of well-meaning Canberra based bureaucrats?

                 stating that the board would not provide those funds. This is a disappointing response from an industry body representing the major producers in this area who have failed to take responsibility for their actions and, of course, not accept the substantial role that they have played in the current issues as well. I have now acted to exercise my powers to direct the MLA to use some of its substantial reserves to manage the immediate domestic impact of the suspension of trade. The government believes that the industry body should support its industry itself, particularly given the funding base which includes both industry and government contributions. To that end, I have acted to deal with that issue and ensureâ€”

                   Under the statutory requirements, I do have to give them an opportunity to consult with me about the decision I have made in terms of the time frame. Given the urgency of this issue, I expect that to be a relatively short period of time. I would have expected the industry to take responsibility for itself and for these circumstances. The industry have failed to do that, and that is why I have acted to ensure that they do take responsibility. That $5 million is important to provide support and relief for onshore domestic producers, to ensure that they can maintain their stock and defray some of the initial impacts that the decision has caused.

Could you also please outline what analysis you did to determine the amount of $5 million initially put into the fund for compensation?

In terms of the broader issue, what I was saying before is that I foreshadow that I will be pursuing a reference to a joint committee to look at not only the broader representative bodies but also the domestic impacts and a range of other matters that I want the parliament to address, because it is important that the parliament have oversight of these important issues. A joint committee would be an appropriate way to deal with that.

                      My question is also to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. During Senate estimates hearings on 24 May, the minister told Senator Coonan that he had asked the live export industry to bring forward a plan to deal with animal welfare outcomes and animal-handling issues in Indonesia. I ask the minister specifically: did he accept or reject the plan? I understand he got it. If the plan was rejected, on what date was it rejected, was the rejection in writing and on what date did the minister so inform the industry; and, Minister, could you release the correspondence between you and the industry on that plan?

                       It is correct to identify that I have been working with industry on this very issue since at least as early as January, when I wrote to the industry. I understand that letter is in the public domain. They did come back with a plan. I am certain Senator Macdonald can obtain the plan from them. I indicate that I did not endorse that plan. As I have continuously said, the plan itself did not go far enough and the timelines it contained were too short to warrant its endorsement. What the industry failed to realise in particular was that the action plan that they provided to my office was not sufficient to provide me with any confidence that they were going to address this issue in the short and near term. As a consequence, I have now had to suspend the live animal export industry to ensure that we can quickly move to a situation where animal welfare is dealt with appropriately and where we can then resume the trade with a supply chain assurance in placeâ€”that is, ensuring that we can track and trace animals from the point of departure to the point of slaughter. Without both of those systems in place, there is no confidence that the industry will be able to restart the trade shortlyâ€”not until and unless they address those two requirements. Failure to reform this industry will mean that, in areas of the

                         and all of the other states of course have an interest in the resumption of this trade, unlike those opposite. What is important, as I highlighted in my answer to the previous question, is that the significant impacts were in the

                         . There are lesser impacts but still impacts in Queensland and other states as well, as those opposite would understand. What we as a government have been doing, unlike those opposite, is working through, firstly, how we can investigate the footage and do the work necessary to make sure we can get this trade up and running again on a sustainable, long-term footing. This industry is at risk if it cannot quickly and deftly move to ensure animal welfare outcomes, because it is an industry that has lost its social licence. Without a social licence, the community will not support the industry in its current form. The industry has not heard that message loudly or clearly enough to dateâ€”

                          , I ask a further supplementary question. I ask the minister: what additional facts did he get that caused him to change his mind from his first decision, which was to ban live cattle exports to just those abattoirs that appeared in the

                          program, to his subsequent decision to completely ban those exports to Indonesia? Is the minister aware that there are a number of abattoirs in Indonesia that are run to Australian standards and could continue to slaughter cattle humanely and in accordance with Australian standards?

                           What those opposite are relying on is guaranteeing that any cattle that leave Australia will end up in a particular abattoir of that standard, but there is no guarantee. What those opposite want to be able to do is say, 'Here is an abattoir that we can send to and we should send to,' but they cannot guarantee it and what they are mischievously trying to suggest is that they can. You cannot guarantee such a thing as there is no supply chain assurance in place as we speak.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           It is wrong to suggest that simply concentrating on an abattoir of a particular standard solves the problem. The problem has to be solved by industry itself looking at how it can put in place a supply chain assurance so that we can have traceability, we can have accountability and we can have transparency and an audit of that supply chain to make sure that the welfare of any cattle that leave Australia is taken care of throughout the supply chain right up to the point of slaughter.
