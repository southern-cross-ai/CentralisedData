         The urgent need to condemn the Albanese Labor Government's latest broken election promise on Israel, as a result of a backroom factional deal ahead of Labor's national conference, which unilaterally changes Australia's position, and does nothing to advance Australia's long-standing position to support a lasting two-state solution, in which Israel and Palestine co-exist in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.
        </p>
        <p>
         I rise to speak on this urgency motion in relation to the Labor Party and the Albanese government playing factional politics with Australia's foreign policy and national security. Once again, yesterday the Labor government chose to play up to hard-left anti-Israel elements within its own party by rewriting our nation's foreign policy. We saw this happen back in October last year when the Labor government's refusal to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was praised by terror groups including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad" rel="nofollow">
          Palestinian Islamic Jihad
         </a>
         and Hamas.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, the Labor government has once again done a dirty factional deal to appease the far-left in their own party, a factional deal that has happened not because of any policy imperative but purely on a basis of trying to manage the political appearance of the Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues. For many weeks now, we have known that something like this was coming. Labor sources had been talking openly about cutting various deals on foreign policy to get through their national conference next week without criticism of the Albanese government, and there is no question whatsoever that what was announced yesterday was one such dirty factional deal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor MPs have freely admitted as such, and I sincerely hope that Labor senators are not going to come in here today and deny that this is what has happened. A Labor MP was quoted directly in today's
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         confirming that this decision was a factional deal, saying:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A Right faction source said the new policy represented an "olive branch" to Left-wing critics to "minimise the argy-bargy next week".
        </p>
        <p>
         That was in reference to their national conference. This Labor MP confirmed that, as part of the factional deal, 'the government will beef-up its language'.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just as its faction-driven refusal to recognise the Israeli capital was welcomed by Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas so too will this decision be welcomed by dangerous organisations and regimes, which are not just violently opposed to the existence of Israel but are also violently against the West, including Australia—organisations like Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic" rel="nofollow">
          Islamic Republic
         </a>
         of Iran and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRGC" rel="nofollow">
          IRGC
         </a>
         , which fund those organisations and have, in recent months, been ramping up support and pressure on those organisations to commit terror attacks against Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese government has shown its willingness to spring into action within weeks and change our foreign policy to manage the media around its national conference and appease the anti-Israel elements—or is it now a majority?—within the Labor Party. In contrast, it is now six months and counting and the Albanese government still hasn't managed to respond to a Senate committee report on the emergency human rights situation in Iran. Not only does the Islamic republic regime commit atrocities against its own people and against its critics abroad; its leaders openly state their desire for Israel to disappear off the face of the earth. I can't help but observe the speed at which the Albanese government will move to adopt the anti-Israel position of its left faction purely because a motion is anticipated to appear at their national conference next week compared to six months of refusing to respond to a report of this Senate urging action in response to the abhorrent behaviour of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran" rel="nofollow">
          Islamic Republic of Iran
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Where is the demand from the left faction within the Labor Party for the Albanese government to respond to recommendations of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on human rights abuses in Iran? I haven't heard those calls. I don't believe there's a motion related to that at the national conference next week. Instead, what we get from this government is a fractional deal which will only serve to embolden the Islamic republic regime in its sponsorship and encouragement of terrorism against Israel.

          I'll commence by saying Australia is a friend of peace. Australia is a friend of Israel. Australia is a friend of the people of the occupied Palestinian territories. I am a friend of peace. I am a friend of Israel. And I am a friend of the people of the occupied Palestinian territories. I'm also the chair of the friendship group here in the parliament for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel" rel="nofollow">
           State of Israel
          </a>
          , and I'm very pleased to work alongside Ms Vamvakinou, in the other place, who is the Chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine. It is in proper, careful dialogue that we will do honour to our nation and strive towards peace.
         </p>
         <p>
          Peace can only reign in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
           Middle East
          </a>
          if there are many of us all across the world who share the positions that I just articulated. My fellow senators, this is where we should be setting our sights: on the worthy goal of peace in the Middle East—such an elusive but worthy goal—rather than on what is happening here this afternoon, which sets its sights only on descent, discontent and division. The Australians have a right to expect better of us. This is why the motion is such a disappointment.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'd like to address the substance of the urgency motion put forward by Senator Chandler, and I do so as a senator for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          but also in my role as the Chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Israel—a Labor senator. I want to remind people that it was
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Evatt" rel="nofollow">
           Doc Evatt

           General Assembly
          </a>
          from 1949 at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations
          </a>
          , served as chair of the ad hoc committee on the Palestinian question. He said, 'It was, in my view, something in the nature of a miracle that the nation of Israel became a reality.' We need to work with others multilaterally to continue to look for peace in the Middle East.
         </p>
         <p>
          The recent announcement by Foreign Minister Penny Wong returns the Australian government to its stated position of the Israel settlements as illegal under international law and it sees the readoption of the term 'occupied Palestinian territories'. The Albanese government view this alteration as maintaining consistency with our multilateral partners on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations Security Council
          </a>
          , with the European Union and also with the United Kingdom.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
           New Zealand
          </a>
          uses these terms, as do many of our other international partners. The government also views this rhetorical return as maintaining the longstanding classification that was shared by both major parties prior to 2014.
         </p>
         <p>
          Foreign Minister Downer referred to the territories as 'occupied', including in media releases and his responses to parliamentary questions. Foreign Minister Smith did so in 2009. Defence Minister Faulkner did so in 2010. The current Deputy Leader of the Opposition,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussan_Ley" rel="nofollow">
           Sussan Ley
          </a>
          , used the term 'occupation' in a speech to the House in 2011. In 2014 Prime Minister Abbott referred to the Palestinian territories as 'disputed territories'. His foreign minister confirmed there had been no policy change. They were occupied territories. So for the opposition to come in here and play mischief with this and pretend it's a change is absolutely a misrepresentation of reality.
         </p>
         <p>
          Let there be no doubt that in adopting these terms the Australian government is reaffirming its commitment to a negotiated two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state co-exist in peace and security. The reaffirmation stands with the Australian government's strong support for the legitimacy and continued security of the State of Israel. The Australian government desires peace in all regions and corners of the globe. This includes welcoming the Abraham Accords and the declared official relations between Israel and Morocco, Bahrain, Sudan, and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates" rel="nofollow">
           United Arab Emirates
          </a>
          , who joined Jordan and Egypt in officially recognising Israel. The government recognises and respects Israel's right to defend itself in a uniquely challenging environment, and the government believes that the Abraham Accords foster that protection to ensure that peace is ultimately achieved.
         </p>
         <p>
          It's the Labor Party's continued policy, without change, that a two-state solution is vital to ensuring peace and security. I am going to run out of time to speak more on this issue, and I hope we have the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to peace and unity as a government for the whole nation. We need to do that in a bipartisan and multipartisan way.

           in this place today as it is a party which long ago recognised Palestinian statehood and has the courage to call out Israel's systemic injustice for what it is: apartheid. Labor's shift in language is a small step forward, but it's the bare minimum and has taken such a long time. Labor must catch up quickly with the reality of the daily injustices that Palestinians face in their homeland.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel" rel="nofollow">
            State of Israel
           </a>
           continues to deny the right of self-determination to Palestinians and continues to dispossess them of their land.
          </p>
          <p>
           We will continue to call for the foreign minister to recognise that apartheid is occurring, raise concern about the far-right agenda of the Netanyahu government and recognise the statehood of Palestinians. Shamefully, there remains a bipartisan commitment to the denial of Palestinian rights and minimisation of the crimes of the Israeli state. Palestinians, for decades, have been amongst the most oppressed people in the world. They are subject to daily humiliation, brutality and violence by the Israeli government. Just this week Israeli forces killed three Palestinians on the occupied
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" rel="nofollow">
            West Bank
           </a>
           . Every day Palestinians are killed or imprisoned or have their houses destroyed and have their land taken by Israeli settlement. For 75 years Palestinians have been betrayed by countries that refuse to hold their persecutor, the State of Israel, to account and give a blank cheque of diplomatic cover to anything the State of Israel does. The Labor government has approved 23 military permits to Israel since March—the same Israeli army which perpetuates crimes against Palestinian people every single day.
          </p>
          <p>
           Not only is Australia silent but the government is aiding and abetting this violence, oppression and systemic elimination of the Palestinian people. Australia is complicit, and it's a disgrace. The Israeli government is the most far-right, extremist coalition government Israel has seen, and the human rights of Palestinians are being further diminished by the day under this horrific Netanyahu regime. Yes, language matters, but this must be accompanied by taking real action for Palestinian human rights, including boycotting meetings with far-right Israeli ministers and placing targeted sanctions on Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for their roles in inflaming human rights abuses against Palestinians. Labor must call the apartheid by its name and push for the Palestinian right to self-determination.

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Neill" rel="nofollow">

            , and I respect the fact that she is one of the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Israel. But, on this occasion, I do disagree with fundamental points raised during her presentation to this chamber, although I recognise that they were made in good faith.
           </p>

            The reason I disagree with Senator O'Neill with respect to this point is that there are two limbs to the change in government policy as announced by Senator Wong in this chamber. The first limb is for the Australian government to adopt a policy that the settlements in these treaties are illegal under international law. I will speak to that in a moment. The second limb is to refer to those territories not just as 'occupied', as you referred to in your speech, Senator O'Neill, but as 'occupied Palestinian territories'. That's the second limb. That's important because the final status of both these issues—the legality of the settlements and where, under a two-state solution, some of these territories would be located—should and can only be the subject of a permanent negotiation between Israel and the relevant Palestinian counterparts. That is the only way this issue can be resolved: through a negotiation that permanently resolves these issues. It does not help the process for this government to give its opinion with respect to the legality of those settlements when the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords" rel="nofollow">
             Oslo Accords
            </a>
            and other agreements which have been made with respect to the peacemaking process recognised that these are issues which can only be permanently decided through a negotiated settlement. The final status of these issues can only be negotiated through a permanent settlement. It doesn't help that process. I recognise, Senator O'Neill, that you and I are on the same page. We want to see a two-state solution and peace in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
             Middle East
            </a>
            . We're absolutely on the same page. But the government's actions in the last week do not help that process.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to the illegal settlement assertion, I say this to the Minister for Foreign Affairs: what consideration did the Australian government give, in coming to this decision on an extraordinarily complicated matter of international law, to the mandates and resolutions of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             League of Nations
            </a>
            following
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
             World War I
            </a>
            ? What consideration was given to the armistice boundaries following the war of 1948, after Israel's independence was declared? What consideration was given with respect to the de facto boundaries that were adopted after the Six-Day War in 1967? What consideration was given to the Jewish people's connection with some of these territories—some of their most holy sites? What sort of consideration was given to those issues? The answer is none.
           </p>
           <p>
            What was considered was the Labor Party's national conference this forthcoming weekend. The timing of this decision betrays that. That's what was considered, not this extraordinarily complicated matter of international law, which has an overlay of very real-world issues for the people of Israel with respect to their safety and wellbeing. Nothing was considered in that regard. What was considered was the forthcoming national conference of the Labor Party—the worst possible background to make such a sensitive foreign policy decision.
           </p>
           <p>
            I come back to that second limb. Commentators have expressed views on this. The wording adopted by the Labor Party in referring to occupied Palestinian territories presupposes the outcome of a negotiated settlement process. That is totally inappropriate. This matter will not be resolved by international parties seeking to unilaterally impose their views on the parties most affected—namely the people of Israel and also the Palestinian representatives. That will not resolve this issue. It must be a negotiated settlement which ultimately will, hopefully, achieve peace in the Middle East.

              What we have here is a Labor government that is making international foreign policy based on internal factional whims. We have foreign policy being decided by factional bosses. I reference my good friend from Queensland Senator Scarr and his rundown of some of the history of Israel and the borders. But that is irrelevant to this discussion, because foreign policy is being decided by factional bosses. What we're seeing is that the Labor Party will gather in Brisbane next week and the Prime Minister is playing factional games. He is using foreign policy to, in effect, manage his own political party. That is not just a national disgrace; that is an international disgrace. What message does that send to our allies—that our foreign policy is made up on the fly by our Prime Minister and Labor factional powerbrokers?

                     Hearing the contributions from some of those opposite, you have to wonder if they are actually trying to advocate for a one-state solution rather than a two-state solution. To be very clear, the government, from the very start, has made absolutely clear that the steps announced by Senator Wong do not prejudge any of the final status issues that those opposite are trying to claim they do. To be absolutely clear, Australia will not be imposing its views on the final borders and boundaries, which should be the result of peace negotiations. That is ultimately where we all should be focused—actually getting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It does not change our commitment to a negotiated two-state solution. It's because of our commitment to pursuing peace and stability in that region that we must call out the conduct of some of those that are undermining that. The government has been very clear that the alteration of language is not about prejudging these final status issues. And, of course, it does not change the fact that Australia is a committed friend of Israel.

                     We'll continue to stand up against the unfair one-eyed treatment of Israel in many international forums and continue to stand up for and work with the Australian Jewish community against the scourge of anti-Semitism, which is often propagated by conspiracy theorists in relation to the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel" rel="nofollow">

                     </a>
                     . We'll also continue to recognise and celebrate the long history of the friendship between our two great countries. Australia is very, very proud of our history as one of the very first country—in fact, we were the first country—to vote in favour of the 1947 UN partition resolution, which ultimately led to the creation of the State of Israel.

                       , the first voice. Then two years later we established the diplomatic relationships that we so cherish today. Our friendship is deep and it is enduring, and the Australian government recognises the unique security situation in and security needs of Israel. We recognise Israel's right to defend itself as it should.

                       The policies of the Albanese government are guided by the principle of advancing the call for peace and moving towards a two-state solution. While any change in language in this space rightly attracts a lot of attention and scrutiny, I would make the point that the language that was put forward by Minister Wong yesterday is not new, as Senator O'Neill made absolutely clear in her contribution. But let's also remember that back in 2018 then prime minister

                       also confirmed that Australia was subject to the

                       Security Council resolutions that described the territory as illegally occupied. It is always important to go back in history, and if you go back further you can see this language used from the Fraser government all the way through to the Gillard government.

                       I also find interesting that somehow this issue concerning Palestine and Israel gets caught up in next week's national conference. Somehow there is a report out there from unnamed sources that the opposition want to play politics on this issue, rather than actually seriously talking about how we together can actually work to support that two-state solution peace process. We heard contributions from some on the crossbench describing Israel as an apartheid state. Disgraceful language is being used. But people need to understand that your actions can bring out the worst in some in this place and also in the community, and that is something we need to be very careful about. Those opposite want to play politics rather than working with the government of the day on how we can support our friends in Israel. Those opposite are coming in here using unnamed sources and so-called reporting of a conference. Maybe you need to look at yourselves and your own democratic processes around how your party organisation operates before you start throwing stones over the aisle.

                        will be patting themselves on the back as they've succeeded in their push on behalf of Palestinians and further continue the denigration of Israel, there will be at least one name that won't rate a mention. In fact, they have deliberately chosen to ignore these activists or, worse, deny their existence. Abu Murkhiyeh was a 25-year-old Palestinian man who was shown in a grisly video being beheaded by an unidentified assailant. The suspect was arrested and questioned, a Palestinian who committed a horrific murder that had been motivated by Abu Murkhiyeh's sexual identity. This happened in October 2022, less than 12 months ago. Those in government are the champions of

                        rights, if you listen to them, but clearly not when it comes to Palestine. In fact, homosexuality remains so deeply shunned in Palestinian society that in 2019 there was an Arab Barometer poll that found only five per cent of
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                         West Bank
                        </a>
                        Palestinian respondents said society should tolerate homosexuality—in fact, the lowest number in the Arab world. So, instead of supporting Israel, the place that many gay Palestinians flee to from Palestine territories in genuine fear of their lives, those in government ignore—as they continue their left-wing crusade—the fact that it is

                        Only this week we saw Minister Wong trying to tie gender equality values on our Pacific neighbours if they want to receive Australian aid. Clearly the same rules do not apply when it comes to the Palestinians. There is a very broad global will that a two-state solution can be reached. But, now, before that can happen, and while those who actually live in Israel are affected every day by this issue—no need to worry! The
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
                         ALP

                        caucus has been able to draw lines on a map to determine where borders can be! The ALP caucus has now settled the dispute, all while settling its own internal factional disputes.

                       <p>
                        Just this year, Minister Wong claimed in Senate estimates: 'We do not support unilateral actions which reduce the prospects of a just two-state solution.' Clearly, that was misinformation. When it comes to trying to calm the factional farm over AUKUS, with around 40 ALP branches about to oppose it at the

                       <p>
                        I would just like to draw attention to this, because I noticed that no-one from the Left of the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party" rel="nofollow">
                         Labour Party
                        </a>
                        would come in and speak to this. In fact, it is two Right ALP members who are known to have strong connections to Israel. Senator

                        , I do credit you with being the co-chair of the parliamentary friends of Israel group, and credit the work that you do there, and I know Senator Ciccone has just returned. But we did hear the interjections from other senators coming from that side of the chamber, and, of course we heard the disgraceful contribution by the Greens. The fact that they talk about human rights abuses—may I just remind the Green of Abu Murkhiyeh and what happened to him simply for being gay. But, of course, those up there will scream the loudest about supporting LGBT, but not if you are a Palestinian. A gay Palestinian person flees to Israel to escape persecution, but you still refer to Israel as somehow being an apartheid state. Well, you might want to go and talk to some gay Palestinians and see how they feel about their treatment by their own people.

                        But coming back to the ALP's decision, the Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council has referred to this decision by Labor as 'profoundly disappointing', and the Australian Jewish Association described this move by Labor as 'hostile'. So we know that there wasn't consultation there. This Labor government needs be upfront and tell the Australian people—particularly

                        —if they consulted the Israeli government or the ambassador. We did learn today that the department—not the minister—made a call to the Israeli ambassador. Who in the Palestinian authorities was consulted? When and where? Whose bidding are they doing?
