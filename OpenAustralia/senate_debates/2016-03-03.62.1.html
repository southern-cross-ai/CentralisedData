        I now outline the significant items sought in the bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        First, this bill would provide the Department of Immigration and Border Protection with just over $447 million, this reflects additional funding for enhancing the management of the onshore Immigration Detention Network; further support for refugee resettlement arrangements; and additional support for the accommodation and processing of asylum seekers.

       <p class="italic">
        Second, the bill would provide the Social Services portfolio just over $277 million. The

         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        would receive just over $102 million primarily to provide support services to resettle an additional 12,000 refugees who are fleeing the conflict in Syria and Iraq. The bill would also provide the National Disability Insurance Agency with just over $108 million for the transition to the full National Disability Insurance Scheme, as agreed with

         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        would also receive just over $11 million for Addressing Welfare Reliance in Remote Communities, which will provide increased incentives for job seekers to work and to strengthen the mutual obligation framework in Community Development Programme regions.
       </p>

        Third, the bill would provide the

         Department of Defence
        </a>
