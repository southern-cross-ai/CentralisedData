         I thank Senator Reynolds for her question. The ADF has made a sustained and significant contribution to the clean-up and recovery effort in Darwin following the impact of Tropical Cyclone Marcus. I understand that the cyclone was described as the most extreme weather event to have struck Darwin since
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Cyclone_Tracy" rel="nofollow">
          Tropical Cyclone Tracy
         </a>
         in 1974, and our thoughts are very much with the families who've been impacted by this devastating storm.
        </p>
        <p>
         As soon as the category 2 cyclone had cleared and the request from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         government for assistance was received, our Defence personnel began supporting the local authorities to clear debris. On average, more than 500 Army,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         and Navy members have been undertaking the clean-up operations across Darwin each day since 19 March. In the last couple of days, yesterday and today, ADF support has increased to 800 personnel so that we can ensure the worst of the clean-up is finished before Easter. The men and women of the ADF have been clearing roads, schools and key buildings across the city. Under
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Task_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Joint Task Force
         </a>
         659, the ADF has cleared debris from 29 schools, from five government buildings and from other facilities, including a renal clinic and the museum and the art gallery. We have also had members of the Air Force working with civil authorities to make sure that the Darwin airport is able to reopen as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I mentioned yesterday, in a display of strong alliance relationships, 50 United States marines in Darwin also lent a hand, voluntarily, to the people of the community there, further illustrating that close bond that military forces so often build between themselves and the communities in which they are based. I'd like to acknowledge the efforts of the Australian and the

            It's a very good question, because it is has been a tumultuous few weeks in Australia in terms of fire, flood and cyclone. And while state and territory governments have primary responsibility for responding to national disasters, including the provision of assistance to affected communities, the ADF has well-established procedures to respond to natural disasters both at home and abroad. We monitor weather events and other natural disasters across our region, and we work closely with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Emergency Management Australia
            </a>
            and international partners to assist when requested and where it's necessary.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have Defence support staff based in capital cities around the country, and they work closely with disaster management authorities in each of those states and territories to ensure that defence is integrated into emergency planning and response. Following Defence assistance to the civil community requests from a state or territory government, we're able to deploy a range of capabilities, which include troops or equipment or technical support like an engineering team, or major platforms such as amphibious ships, or heavy transport aircraft and satellite imagery.

               I can. As Minister Fierravanti-Wells reminded us last week, the ADF has also been part of providing emergency relief to the people of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
                Papua New Guinea

               following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake there on 26 February. We have had over 100 ADF members deployed as part of Operation
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
                PNG
               </a>
               Assist. We have contributed one C-130J Hercules, three CH-47F Chinooks, a B300 King Air light aircraft and one C-17 heavy transport aircraft, which has been part of delivering supplies to the remote and very badly affected

              <p>
               In total, the ADF has delivered over 310 tonnes of emergency relief supplies and we've provided $5 million in humanitarian aid. While that immediate emergency has passed, there might be a need for follow-on relief support for affected communities in PNG from time to time. We will continue to deliver stores with the ADF efforts over the next couple of months, as required, in coordination with the government and the
