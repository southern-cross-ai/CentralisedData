         Could I ask for clarification from the minister in relation to the differences in the bill that was discharged from the list and this bill. Is there anything that the Senate needs to be made aware of?

          I thank Senator Parry for the question. I am advised that the bill that was discharged was to do with federal financial relations. This bill is to do with safety and quality. I hope that answers your question. I would be happy to answer any further questions.

             by leave—I move Greens amendments (2), (3), (4) and (5) on sheet 7014 together:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (2)    Clause 9, page 7 (line 6), after “Note”, insert “1”.

            <p class="italic">
             (3)    Clause 9, page 7 (after line 7), at the end of subclause (1), add:
            </p>
            <p>
             Note 2:  Sections 10 and 11 impose consultation requirements on the Commission.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (4)    Clause 10, page 8 (after line 16), after paragraph (2)(d), insert:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (da)    carers; and
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (db)    consumers; and
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (5)    Clause 11, page 9 (after line 29), after paragraph (2)(b), insert:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (ba)    carers; and

             (bb)    consumers; and
            </p>
            <p>
             I will not rehash what I said in my speech in the second reading debate; I will just remind senators that these amendments will ensure better consultation with consumers and carers. This was an issue that was brought up very strongly during an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. If this is going to work it is essential that consumers and carers are included.

                These amendments relate to the appointment of board members, as I articulated yesterday, to ensure that there is expertise in primary health care services and management of general practice.

                  On behalf of the government, I can indicate that the government recognises that these amendments allow for additional representation of primary health care providers and managers of general practice on the commission’s board. With respect to the last amendment, we accept that this clarifies, particularly for consumers, the obligations of health providers around informed consent. I also want to indicate that these amendments address issues that were raised by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

                   I do not want to say too much on the amendments. I simply want to pass comment and apologise to the House for not being here on a vote that was very close. I want to indicate on my own behalf and behalf of some others that we were attending the Prime Minister’s dinner for the

                   . The bells started ringing in the course of a welcome to country in which there were loud didgeridoo noises and most people were unable to hear the bells. When some of my colleagues with better eyesight than mine noticed the red light, a number of us turned and ran out during the course of the welcome to country by Australia’s Indigenous people—not a good look for those who were in there. I know nothing can interrupt the workings of the Senate and this is what we are here for, but when there are official dinners on could I suggest to those in charge of voting that perhaps voting should be done at time when—

                    The point I am making is that there was a welcome to country by Australia’s Indigenous people with loud didgeridoo music which, quite frankly, cut out all other noise, including the bells ringing and including the beepers ringing. It is not a good look when two or three people turn and run out of the hall during a welcome to country ceremony. I know the business of the Senate cannot be interrupted for dinners and social occasions, even though it was an official dinner called by the Prime Minister of this country, but I just suggest that when these things happen perhaps closer consideration might be given to when the divisions are called. Perhaps they could be delayed until some later time.
