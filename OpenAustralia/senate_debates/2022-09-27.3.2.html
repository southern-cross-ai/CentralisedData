       </p>
       <p>
        I will make the following remarks before I move that the question be put. As Senator Gallagher has given notice of, we're signalling to the Senate the priority nature of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security
        </a>
        (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Measures) Bill 2022 for the government, which is no secret to the members of this place as it was a clear commitment of the Labor Party at the election. It is critical that the legislation pass the Senate today to ensure it can return, with likely amendments, to the House of Representatives tomorrow, and then be enacted, to deliver the government's commitments and to ensure people can be safely transitioned off the card.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately the Liberal-National opposition have taken an unconstructive approach to Senate debate in each sitting week since the election and insist on filibustering debates to delay passage, and we're in the position where we need to sit late into this night to ensure the bill gets passed. This is a problem of the opposition's own making. We saw time-wasting yesterday, and I'm sure we will see it again today. I would like to remind those opposite that this government has a clear mandate in relation to this legislation, and the government is clear about delivering upon our commitments to the Australian people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will make some additional comments in relation to the territory rights legislation. Whilst the government has many legislative priorities to consider before the end of the year, this is one bill I would like to highlight briefly.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        has already begun its consideration of the Restoring Territory Rights Bill. It is the government's clear position that we resolve this bill once and for all before the end of the year, noting that it will be a conscience vote and noting that we have taken the view previously that conscience votes ought not be the subject of guillotines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Restoring territory rights is an issue important to many in this place, particularly the territory senators, and I acknowledge Senator Katy Gallagher, who has advocated on this issue for the past decade. It has been an issue that this Senate and previous Senates have considered at length, and we want to ensure that this issue is voted on this year. The motion before you provides an hour for debate on this bill tomorrow, to take a further step towards a vote on the bill, and we will continue to look for opportunities through the remainder of the sitting calendar year to ensure it comes to a final vote before the Senate finally rises. I move:
