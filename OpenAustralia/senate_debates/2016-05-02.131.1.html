           I thank the chamber. The document Senator Madigan has asked to be tabled contains sensitive personal information of those involved in the investigations outlined in this motion. Many of these documents concern mattes that have not yet been finalised and, as such, it would be highly inappropriate for them to be released at this point in time.
