        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to questions without notice I asked today relating to vaccine indemnities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Gallagher is the Minister for Finance and is overseeing contingent liabilities in the budget. Although I prefer the words 'fake-cine' or 'injectable', what these products are not are vaccines. A vaccine prevents a person getting and transmitting an illness; these COVID 'fake-cines' do neither. Australia first provided indemnities in 2015 under the previous Liberal government for mpox and flu vaccines. Those indemnities are still in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now we have 14 more indemnities for COVID products, and they'll be permanent. Labor's deal to get Moderna's production plant into Australia was revealed last week. Any vaccine manufactured in Moderna's Australian factory, which is now under construction, will receive an indemnity. The agreement sets out that these vaccines will be indemnified as part of a pandemic vaccine advance-purchase agreement and additionally as part of a routine, non-pandemic vaccine supply agreement. In other words, every vaccine made will be indemnified with no word about testing. The new Moderna indemnity extends to routine vaccine supply, and the minister is not able to claim securing supply in a crisis.

        has mentioned that there are 400 mRNA vaccines and products under development to replace conventional vaccines with expired patents. The attraction of mRNA is protecting profit from the patent cliffâ€”not protecting better health. Those products will be for humans, livestock and pets. Our health authorities and politicians are promoting experimental mRNA products and, in so doing, risking everyday Australians' health. I was hoping to hear why in the minister's answer. Why is the government normalising indemnities, giving foreign multinational pharmaceutical companies blanket indemnities so they can avoid being accountable and encouraging companies to lie in their clinical trials, fudge efficacy data and cover up enduring death, as Pfizer was proven to have done in their COVID 'fake-cine' development? This question is not going away. We will relentlessly hound you down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
