        My question is to the Minister for Human Services, Senator Payne, representing the Minister for Education. Can the minister update the Senate on the progress of higher education reforms following input from crossbench senators?

         I thank Senator McGrath very much for the question. As senators will know, the government has, in fact, taken on board a number of important changes proposed by Senate members of the crossbench to the proposed higher education reforms. We have included those in a new reform bill which was introduced to the House of Representatives yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
         The new reform bill accepts, firstly, a proposal made by Senator Day in relation to keeping the indexation of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
          HECS
         </a>
         at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
          CPI
         </a>
         , and also Senator Madigan's proposal, which I understand Senator Wang has also carefully considered, for a HECS indexation pause for the primary care-giver of newborns. The government will also fund more scholarships for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, on top of the Commonwealth scholarships. Senator Muir has particularly advocated for that. There are other improvements, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all now have some months to discuss the reforms and to negotiate further improvements. As Professor Sandra Harding from

         said yesterday: 'Appropriately amended, these reforms can deliver a high-quality and sustainable higher education and research system.' Professor Harding, who is also the chair of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Universities Australia
         </a>
         , has stressed both the need and the urgency of the reforms, saying that the status quo is not an option.

         That is what these reforms deliver. Even the Regional Universities Network release yesterday was headed, 'The

           I can indeed do that for Senator McGrath. These reforms have enormous benefits for students. Above all, though, it means they will get an education of the quality they want, a truly world-class education in the courses they want, with the Commonwealth support they want, without having to pay a single cent up front.
          </p>
          <p>
           The new bill makes
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
            HECS
           </a>
           even more generous. It is HECS that guarantees that access to higher education is based on ability, not income.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
            The Commonwealth
           </a>
           scholarship scheme will support tens of thousands of disadvantaged students in going to university, and with even more students supported now through additional scholarships in the new bill. The Commonwealth will be supporting all Australian undergraduate students in all registered higher education institutions, from diplomas to bachelor degrees, supporting students on pathways into higher education, and, importantly, in qualifications for jobs. We will in fact see lower fees for many students, as COPHE, the Council of Private Higher Education, has confirmed.

             As I indicated in response to Senator McGrath's first question, there have been some very constructive proposals from crossbench senators, and their further input is warmly welcomed. But, otherwise, as Professor Greg Hill, the vice-chancellor of the University of the

              Sunshine Coast
             </a>
             said yesterday, there is no alternative. There is no credible alternative from those opposite. They are the party of a dishonest scare campaign. They are a party of $6.6 billion in cuts to higher education and research and funding cliffs for research fellowships and infrastructure. These reforms will provide funding for research Future Fellowships and for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, for which the other side left no funding at all. So if the reforms are not passed, there are not the funds to support these. We will lose valuable research talent to overseas and the 1,500 people whose jobs depend on NCRIS will lose their jobs.
