        My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I ask: is the governor of Oruzgan province in Afghanistan, Mohammed Sherzad, a good and important ally for the Australian contingent in that province? Is it true that this governor has asked to be transferred from his post because it is too dangerous for him to stay in office? Can the minister tell the chamber whether the Prime Minister met the governor on her recent visit and whether or not he discussed the fact that it was too dangerous for him to remain in that office in Oruzgan province?

         As minister representing, I do not have a full brief in terms of all the questions contained in Senator Brown's primary question, but I can advise him in response to some of the issues he has raised.
        </p>
        <p>
         As everyone in this chamber knows, it is a difficult time in Oruzgan province. We have seen this in the most recent incidents resulting in the wounding of three Australians and two Afghan soldiers, and we all send our sympathies to them and their families. As I say, it is a very difficult time. We are aware of recent press reports indicating that the governor, Governor Sherzad, is seeking another position in the Afghan government. I cannot speculate on those reports. I have no further information other than an awareness of those reports.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we do know is that Australia has appreciated the valuable work that Governor Sherzad has undertaken in Oruzgan across a full spectrum of issues and he remains a valued partner of Australia's forces there. During his time as governor we have made substantial headway in training the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Afghan National Army
         </a>
         4th Brigade. Security in the province has improved in large measure due to his willingness to work closely with us throughout the province. He does remain a consistent voice for the people of Oruzgan and is focused intently on making improvements in the fields of good governance and the rule of law. I am advised that, as a valued partner, the government would not like to see him leave his position; however, this is ultimately obviously a matter for the Afghan government.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I have indicated, we do not have any information other than the reports that you referred to. But the Australian contingent in Oruzgan continue to have strong and positive relations with the Afghan government and Afghan regional officials, and obviously they are currently experiencing quite a difficult time, particularly as a result of that recent attack.

          My supplementary question is this: is the danger to the governor which has got him to ask for a transfer related to what

          warns as Afghan security forces being widely infiltrated by the Taliban, and can the government give a report to the Senate about that infiltration and the increasing danger it poses to our own forces in Oruzgan?

           Senator Brown would be aware of the reports or the commentary by the

           </a>
           regarding these matters, and I think they are currently pursuing inquiries to make sure they understand exactly what happened in this incident involving the shooting of three Australian soldiers and two Afghans. So I think people do not want to leap to conclusions or generalise, but there is no doubt this incident has caused concern.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is the case that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANA" rel="nofollow">
            ANA
           </a>
           soldiers are recruited from across all provinces of Afghanistan and it is the case that they are deliberately not employed in areas of the country from which they are recruited. It is designed to dislocate them from existing family, tribal and social associations and aid in the operational effectiveness of the ANA. So there are strong procedures in place to try to guard against this sort of thing. But clearly ADF are going to pursue their inquiries into this matter, and I think it is best that we—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer to a letter from a relative of a soldier serving in Afghanistan that says, 'Everyone that you speak to wants the boys home because no-one believes in this cause anymore.' Is the government receiving more dispatches from relatives concerned about the safety of their loved ones in Afghanistan? What is the response to that appeal?

             I have had discussions with both Minister Smith and the Prime Minister, who indicate that the morale of Australian troops in Afghanistan is very strong and that they remain very committed to the task at hand. I have attended many farewells for Australian troops being deployed overseas to Iraq, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
              Middle East
             </a>
             more generally and Afghanistan, and it is always the case that, while the troops are committed and positive about their task despite the dangers, their parents, wives, husbands, children and families generally are highly apprehensive and seriously concerned and often wish that they were not undertaking that mission. That is the nature of families who care for their sons and daughters. It is a perfectly human emotion. Our troops remain highly motivated, highly professional and highly committed to getting the job done, and that is the important thing.
