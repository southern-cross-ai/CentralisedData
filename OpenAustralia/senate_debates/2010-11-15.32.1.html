         I thank Senator Forshaw for his question. I know he maintains an interest in the agriculture portfolio. The Gillard government is working closely with states and territories on the issue of plague locusts. I recently met with my state counterparts from Queensland,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , Victoria and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         to discuss the national situation for a collective response to this threat. This season could see some areas of Victoria facing their worst locust infestation for up to 75 years. With half a million hectares already affected, this year’s outbreak puts at risk a $2 billion crop in Victoria alone. Managing this threat and limiting the damage can only be achieved through a concerted and collaborative effort between government agencies and individual landholders.
        </p>
        <p>
         To prepare for the actions required to minimise locust damage to crops and pastures in these areas, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Plague_Locust_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Plague Locust Commission
         </a>
         , agencies from the affected states and national interest groups have been working positively to develop and implement an integrated response plan. Large swarms of locusts were present over wide areas of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in autumn—that is, between April and May 2010—and established egg beds which have now hatched across these three states. Well-defined areas of operation have been established by the Australian Plague Locust Commission and state agencies to ensure effective coverage of infected areas. Resourcing of the response, including aircraft availability and pesticide supplies, has been addressed with plans established for these agencies to collectively treat up to 2.5 million hectares of infestation. Aerial control by the Australian Plague Locust Commission had treated a total area of not more than 54,000 hectares by 11 November.

           I am pleased to say the prospects for the forthcoming winter and summer crops in Australia are favourable. Winter grain crops in the eastern states are in a very positive position after receiving good rainfall over the July-August period, and further rainfall over the eastern parts of Australia for most of September has boosted yield expectations. Given the favourable seasonal conditions in the eastern states,

           is forecasting winter crop production to be around 40.7 million tonnes in 2010, which is 16 per cent higher than last season.

             . The Australian Plague Locust Commission continues to provide updated information to state agencies and landholders to assist in their response efforts while also commencing the implementation of its own response plan. The commission has also provided training to state agencies to assist them in preparing an efficient and effective response to the impending locust threat. The states involved have worked hard and collaboratively to develop their own response plans, including education and support for landholders who continue especially to play a vital role in implementing an effective locust control response. While individual states are responsible for the first response in their territories, the commission will take an active role in coordinating the response where a plague is forecast to impact on multiple states.
