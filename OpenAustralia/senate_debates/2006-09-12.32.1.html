        My question is to the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp. Will the minister update the Senate on the progress of coalition government programs encouraging Australian school children to become more active? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         Thank you to Senator Cory Bernardi for this important question. I acknowledge his continued interest in this topic. Many of my colleagues,

         for the Active After-school Communities Program. I think it is true to say that this was an occasion which was able to highlight to Parliament House, and I hope to the wider community, the importance of this program. As senators know, I do not often praise Senator Lundy in this place, but Senator Lundy was at this particular occasion and, I must say, is able to support this program, as indeed I think all parts of the chamber are.

         As many senators know, in June 2004, the Prime Minister announced the Building a Healthy, Active Australia initiative, which was to encourage all young Australians to participate in more physical activity and embrace healthy eating habits. A major component of this very important program is the Active After-school Communities program. Its aim is simply to get more young children—those who are particularly inactive—doing safe, fun and inclusive physical exercise. The program, as senators would know, offers free, structured physical activity to all children in primary schools that are registered and out of school hours care services across Australia, in the hours after school.

         The sports portfolio, through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Sports_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Sports Commission
         </a>
         , has carriage of the development and implementation of this very important Active After-school Communities program. It is a practical means of improving the health, wellbeing and motor skill competencies of primary school children. The support for the program has been overwhelming and the government aims to involve over 3,000 primary schools and childcare approved centres with the program by term 3, 2007.

         Last week Kieren Perkins and Cathy Freeman were here in Parliament House for a very successful occasion. It is a program which is very important. Today, the Prime Minister and the Minister for

           Senator Lundy is very excited about this and that is terrific. Senator Lundy, we can arrange a photo with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kewell" rel="nofollow">
            Harry Kewell
           </a>
           if you like. I will take that on board and see whether it is possible. Indeed, every other senator in this chamber would be very proud to have a photo with the great Harry Kewell. Similar to the role of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieren_Perkins" rel="nofollow">
            Kieren Perkins
           </a>
           and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Freeman" rel="nofollow">
            Cathy Freeman
           </a>
           , Harry Kewell will work with schools, community groups and the media as part of the government’s ongoing campaign to promote healthy living. Harry Kewell is not only a great footballer but a fantastic role model for young Australians, and the government is very pleased to have his involvement in this program.
          </p>
          <p>
           To conclude, this is a very important program. It enjoys the support, I believe, of all senators and members. It is one that the government is very keen to continue to promote. It is important that we get as many young Australians as possible, particularly those who are not very active, involved in this program.
