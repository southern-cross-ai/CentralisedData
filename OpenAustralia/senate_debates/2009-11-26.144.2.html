        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Senator Carr. I refer the minister to comments made by the Prime Minister prior to the 2007 election, when he said that school chaplains actually are ‘the glue which keeps school communities rolling’. Why did the government yesterday vote against giving a long-term guarantee that this important School Chaplaincy Program would be continued?

           I thank Senator Mason for his question. Senator Mason would know the truth in regard to this matter. He would know that this was a program which was commenced by the previous government. They provided $165 million for a program that was to run for three years. One hundred and sixty-five million dollars over three years was to be made available to Australian school communities to assist in the provision of chaplaincy services. It was for only three years. We now hear this claim that there should be a program that goes indefinitely. That is not what the previous government decided. That is not what the Howard government decided. The Howard government decided that this program should go for only three years and advised schools accordingly. That is why it provided for the program to run for three years. As a consequence, we now have a situation where some 2,700 schools have received funding, and the funding to those schools was scheduled to end in mid-2010. That was the decision of the previous government: to end the program in 2010.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Rudd Labor government has expressed its determination to ensure that schools are supported in providing for the wellbeing of their students, and it has acknowledged that the National School Chaplaincy Program has been an effective way to assist schools in achieving this important goal. So on 21 November the Prime Minister—Prime Minister Rudd—announced that an additional—

            , I ask a supplementary question. Given that 2,700 schools have school chaplains and over 97 per cent of those schools think that chaplains have had a positive influence on their school, why has the Rudd government chosen to deny more than 7,000 other schools the chance of applying for their own school chaplains?

             , on 21 November Prime Minister Rudd announced that there would be an additional $42.8 million made available for this program—a program that, under the previous government, was to end in the middle of next year. The decision of the previous Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was to end the program. But Prime Minister Rudd has in fact extended the program by $42.8 million, which will provide funding to ensure that the good work of the 2,700 schools will continue until December—

                 The Prime Minister has announced that the $42.8 million will be available to assist schools to provide additional support up until December 2011. This is to extend the program way beyond what the Liberals had done—that is, to end the program next year.

                     What the government is doing is to provide additional support and provide wide consultations with chaplaincy providers, school principals, parents and community groups, state education authorities and the Catholic and independent school sectors to examine the options that exist beyond 2012. While the program has been well supported by schools and communities, the consultation process will examine some of the preliminary feedback that we have already received, including further consideration of services for disadvantaged or remote schools, the inclusion of secular support staff and alternative funding models.
