        As Australians we pride ourselves on being a nation built on many cultures and religions to form our great multicultural society. One of the most enjoyable things about being a representative of the people of Queensland is being able to take part and celebrate in our nation’s multiculturalism. On Saturday, 30 August 2008 I had the privilege to attend the celebration of Queensland’s oldest mosque in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Holland Park

        , Brisbane. Holland Park Mosque, first built of wood in 1908 in the days of the

        policy, is now made of brick. It is hard to believe that this country restricted access to migrants until only 30 years ago. We are now a rich, diverse culture. Brisbane alone now has a population of over 20,000 Muslims and this figure continues to grow.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the morning’s proceedings I was sitting next to the commissioner of police, chatting about the Islamic community in Brisbane. We discussed the events and atrocities that happened to other mosques as a result of 9-11 attacks, where, as a result of stereotyping and xenophobia, attempts were made to burn down mosques. When I looked around the crowd, there were children playing on rides and mothers caring for their babies. The question really struck me then why some people in our society have concerns about people who dress differently or who wear their hair in a different way.

        The President of the

        of Holland Park, Mustafa Ally, compiled for the occasion a comprehensive book on the history of the mosque and the people who contributed to it, which was well received by guests on the day. Mustafa received the 2008 Multicultural Citizen of the Year Award at the Australia Day Awards this year. He is a big community supporter in Brisbane and a proud Australian citizen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mustafa’s book looks into the difficulties Muslims faced in the early 1900s during the time of Australia’s first Prime Minister, Sir
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Barton" rel="nofollow">

        . Some of you would be aware that in 1901 the Immigration (Restriction) Act was introduced to secure racial purity. Australia used xenophobic language tests to prevent undesirable people migrating to Australia. It sounds similar to legislation put through this parliament by the previous government.

        , at the time, commented:

        The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman.
       </p>
       <p>
        We saw a decline in the Muslim population up until the days of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        , who, in 1975, brought an end to this intolerant legislation through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Racial Discrimination Act
        </a>
        . Visionary Labor leaders, such as Gough, implemented legislation that contributed to the fabric of our great society today.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the rest of the day I met with Muslim community leaders and other dignitaries and spent time looking at the wonderful architecture and history of the mosque. I met many proud Australian families, mosque community groups and friends—friends like Abdul Obeid and his son, Abdul Jr. They were pleasing faces to see. On that day I learned for first time that the Muslim faith in Australia dates back to the 17th century. Today there are 340,000 Muslims, 36 per cent of whom were born in Australia, who are part of our diverse nation.
       </p>

        It is sad to think that during the previous government’s time, multiculturalism, while it existed, was not embraced. There was mandatory detention; the ‘Pacific solution’; the treatment of refugees; the apology, or lack thereof—ministers claiming the stolen generation never happened; and the citizenship test on Australian values. These all occurred under their watch.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we are turning a new page, and being at the centenary of the Holland Park Mosque reminded me of the pride I have in being a part of a multicultural society and part of a party that recognises and embraces cultural diversity. I am proud that we now have a Prime Minister and an immigration minister who are committed to making positive changes for our nation. We have seen the apology to the stolen generation, a boost in skilled migration and a restoration of our immigration system. Detention centres are now being used only as a last resort for the shortest practicable time. There have been 13,041 humanitarian visas granted, helping people escape war, political strife and persecution; there has been $3.4 million in grants to help refugees prepare for the Australian citizenship test; and eventually the temporary protection visa regime will end. I am proud to be part of a government that embraces our diversity. I am an Australian who is proud of our rich diversity. The many people who attended the centenary of the Holland Park Mosque are proud to be part of our diverse nation.
