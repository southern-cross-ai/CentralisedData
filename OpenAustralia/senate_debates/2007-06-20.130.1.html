        My question is to Senator Johnston, Minister for Justice and Customs. I refer the minister to reports that the federal member for Bonner, Mr Ross Vasta, has repaid $24,000 worth of entitlements to the Commonwealth. Can the minister indicate whether the need for this repayment was identified through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        investigation into the ‘Printgate’ affair involving Mr Vasta and his Queensland Liberal colleagues Mr Andrew Laming and Mr Gary Hardgrave? Given the absence of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        statement about the repayment, can the minister advise whether the investigation into Mr Vasta’s activities will continue even after he has repaid the money? Will Mr Laming and Mr Hardgrave also be given the opportunity to repay money that they may have allegedly misused before the AFP investigation is finalised?

         Firstly, it should come as absolutely no surprise to the learned senator that I know nothing of the intricacies of this investigation. Indeed, I have made it my primary business not to involve myself or to be aware of what is, in fact, happening with this investigation, given the obvious conflicting circumstances that prevail. This government conducts itself at all times with the utmost propriety. That question does not sit well with a shadow minister in the nature of a shadow Attorney-General or a member of the bar. To infer and to presume guilt in an inquiry where no charges have yet been laid is a disgrace. To impugn a fellow parliamentarian, to imply that he is guilty, with no skerrick of knowledge or evidence, is typical of the sort of kangaroo court we would expect from these people were they ever to get the reins of power. He knows that I have not involved myself in this inquiry and would not. Indeed, that question does him no honour.

          , I ask a supplementary question. It is a pity that the minister could not provide information about the general matter. It has not been a specific question about the actual incident itself. But, be that as it may, has the minister sought or received an explanation from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
           AFP
          </a>
          about the length of time it has taken to investigate the behaviour of the three Queensland MPs? Has the minister sought an explanation or been advised by the AFP when it will be completed?

           The honourable senator well knows that the answers to those questions are no and no.
