In November, Senator Fifield sought to defend his decision to gift $30 million to Fox Sports on the basis that 70 per cent of all women's sport was on Foxtel. What proportion of women's sport was broadcast on free-to-air

               He loves a point of order, does Senator Farrell. Thank you—30 seconds in. Indeed, the promotion and viewing of women's sport is incredibly important to ensure that young women are inspired and motivated to participate in physical activity and that they can see actual role models, whether it is

               —what a fabulous international athlete—as one of our fabulous Matildas. So it is important that not only are young women able to see our female athletes on free-to-air, such as our

              </p>
              <p>
               So, Senator Farrell, I have absolutely no issue with Fox Sports being given an incentive to promote women's sport; nor do I have an issue with

What is the substance of those guidelines? Have they been made public? If so, when and where would they be available?

                  Thank you very much, Senator Farrell. Yes, the guidelines are out there. They're being discussed, as the Minister for Communications has already answered you. I want to touch on your earlier question around the ABC. I remember getting up very early on a Sunday morning to watch netball. They were the first broadcaster to broadcast women's sport. We thank the ABC for being a leader in broadcasting women's sport, but the ABC gets a billion dollars a year from the public taxpayer. It's very well positioned to broadcast women's sports, and I'd actually encourage it to get out there into our communities and use the technology that's available to it to look not just at the

                   WBBL

                  , the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
                   AFL
                  </a>
                  et cetera but also at the more niche sports that women are participating in right across our communities and get it onto the public broadcaster so that we can all get a good look.

                     Thank you for your question, Senator. As I've already said, I would love the ABC to get into broadcasting sport—not just women's sport, Senator Farrell, but all sport. I think the ABC needs to think less about high culture and a little bit more about low culture, because there are more people participating in sport in this country than there are attending the opera or the theatre. I want to see the ABC investing some of that billion dollars into real people doing sport right out in our communities. Get the cameramen and camerawomen or get the local ABC Radio broadcasters down to the local footy or down to the local netballers. We pay you a billion bucks. Get out of the studio and into the community and talk about what matters to real people—and that is sport.
