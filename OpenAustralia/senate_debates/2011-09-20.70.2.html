                  Implementing this measure was a Labor 2010 election commitment: “A Gillard Labor Government will introduce legislation to give the Chief of the Defence Force more control and responsibility over the Cadets.” Implementation of the measure will strengthen the lines of accountability over for the ADF Cadet youth development organisation.

                  Act 2005 to make several minor governance and business changes. One of the amendments is to ensure that information held by Indigenous Business Australia will be appropriately protected but capable of being disclosed by that organisation in carrying out its proper functions, consistent with similar Commonwealth arrangements. Another change is to amend the agency head title of several portfolio bodies from ‘

                  The amendment to the information-handling provision is important to enable Indigenous Business Australia to disclose information to agencies with responsibility for overseeing Commonwealth administrative practices – such as the Ombudsman and the

                  . This has not been possible to date because of a narrow focus in the provisions in question. In the past the current provisions have also prevented information being given to Commonwealth agencies working on joint initiatives with Indigenous Business Australia – and also to State and Territory agencies seeking to work more closely with Indigenous Business Australia to achieve better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities. The amended provision should overcome these difficulties, while maintaining appropriate protection of sensitive information. The new provisions will be consistent with similar Commonwealth arrangements for handling protected information, such as in the family assistance law and the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010.

                  Australia needs to reduce its carbon pollution as part of global efforts to combat climate change. Cuts in global pollution are necessary to reduce the risks posed by unmitigated climate change. For Australia, these risks are large, threatening the economy, natural heritage and our way of life.

                  Timely introduction of a carbon price is the most cost-effective and economically responsible way of reducing Australia’s carbon pollution. Its timely introduction would enable Australia to play its part in global efforts to reduce the risks posed by climate change. A carbon price will also provide opportunities for innovation and investment in lower carbon technologies, and opportunities and rewards for improved land use management.
