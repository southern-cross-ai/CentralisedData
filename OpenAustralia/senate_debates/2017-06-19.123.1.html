         I thank Senator Fawcett for his question. Both the Prime Minister and I participated in the region's pre-eminent defence dialogue recently, the Shangri-La Dialogue, which was held in Singapore slightly earlier this month. It is true to say that as a region we have experienced an unprecedented period of stability and in fact rising prosperity, but neither stability nor prosperity have come about by chance; they are the result of concerted efforts to set and to live by rules that govern our economic integration and also our security cooperation. The region's rules based order has been the cornerstone of equity, stability and transparent decision-making, which protects us from actions that might destabilise that security and prosperity. These were the focuses of much of the discussions, both in the dialogue's plenary sessions, which both the Prime Minister and I addressed, and in bilateral meetings with our counterparts. Our regional security partners, it is fair to say, share many of our security concerns, including—most self-evidently in recent weeks—the growing threat posed by returning foreign fighters seeking to create disturbances within the region; North Korea's unlawful, reckless and dangerous conduct; and, indeed, continued territorial disputes in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
          South China Sea
         </a>
         . Upholding the rule of law is the best way to ensure that stability prevails.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is working closely with our regional partners and our allies to support regional security architecture, particularly the

            The effectiveness of our regional cooperation is absolutely vital to addressing the threat of foreign fighters returning to our region. We are seeing the impact that, in part, is being made by such individuals in Marawi, in the Philippines, at the moment. We have built strong counterterrorism relationships with our regional partners. The ADF undertakes an extensive program of counterterrorism engagement and capacity-building activities, including special forces training with Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and India, to name some.

               Multilateral agreements most often underpin our regional stability and prosperity because they foster cooperation, formalise security commitments and build trust. But, as well as the regional arrangements I have already mentioned, there are a number of bilateral and trilateral defence relationships that are also very important. We have been working hard on strengthening our trilateral defence cooperation with Japan and the United States. They both share our commitment to the rules based order and strengthening of our regional security architecture that underpin our region's stability and prosperity. In fact, during the dialogue I met with the

We reiterated our close commitment to coordination and cooperation in humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and maritime security—of which we received a timely reminder on the weekend, with the very shocking collision between a freighter and the
