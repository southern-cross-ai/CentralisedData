        My question is to Senator Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the minister’s answer to questions yesterday from Senator Ryan. In estimates on 28 May 2009, I asked questions about the composition of the border protection committee of cabinet, and was told by the secretary of the minister’s department that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … a number of officials would routinely attend the Border Protection Committee meeting:

       </p>
       <p>
        There was no mention here of ministerial staff, so when did the Prime Minister’s staff start attending meetings of the border protection committee of cabinet, and what are their names?

         I also indicated that there was a series of meetings of ministers and staff who helped to deal with the day-to-day management of the issues. The lead ministers in that regard were

               As I made clear, there were staff from offices present at the meetings where this matter was managed. I also made very clear that responsibility for the management of the issues involved and the authorisation of government actions were made by the relevant ministers: the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
                Mr Smith

               </a>
               , Mr O’Connor; and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, me. That is where the management of these matters lay and that is where the authority of the government came from. Various officials were involved at various stages; various staff attended some of the considerations and advice was sought as appropriate. But the responsibility was through the border protection committee of cabinet, which I chair, and the authorisation for government actions was either through that committee or through the joint effort of the responsible ministers. It was all done in accordance with normal practice.

                   Senator Ronaldson, I would not trust everyone in that regard, but Senator Fierravanti-Wells I do! I make the key point in response to that question: the premise is wrong. Responsibility for these matters lies with the border protection committee of cabinet and with the relevant ministers. Decisions were taken by us and the authorisation of actions was taken by us. I have been very clear on numerous occasions that the responsibility for these matters lay with the ministers. We are accountable for our actions, we are responsible for the authorisations of those actions and those authorisations were properly given by the appropriate ministers. I have outlined to you who they were.
