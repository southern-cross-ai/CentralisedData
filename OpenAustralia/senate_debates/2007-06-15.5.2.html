         As I indicated last night when I was speaking at 11 pm, we will not be supporting this amendment moved by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         . Labor is on the record frequently and often talking about the impact of advertising on children, children’s eating habits and families. We are not of the view that this is the place to deal with this issue. It is an issue that, I believe, the Labor Party have put on the agenda for a long time and we will ensure that an appropriate policy response to the inappropriate advertising of lower quality food—let us call it that rather than junk food—will be developed at the appropriate time. But this is not the place to deal with this particular matter.

          I thank Senator McLucas for her comments. Firstly, I would like to assure Senator Siewert that even the more liberal amongst us—indeed libertarian amongst us—do not believe that restrictions on advertising constitute a nanny state. Be not concerned about that. Indeed, this morning I read the
          <i>
           Australian
          </i>
          newspaper and saw that Kellogg’s has just announced that, because of concerns about obesity, they will no longer use cartoons and toys to advertise cereals for young children. So you make a very valid point.
         </p>
         <p>
          As Senator McLucas said, this is not really the place to proceed with this sort of amendment. Australia currently has policy and regulatory requirements that limit television advertising of food and drink to children during children’s viewing times. Like Senator McLucas, we do not believe that it is appropriate for legislative action in this area while the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Communications and Media Authority
          </a>
          is reviewing the current standards. In fact, public consultation is yet to be concluded and the resulting public comment should, I think, inform any legislative change in this area. So I think this proposal is a bit premature; we should wait for the public consultation process to be conducted. I understand that a discussion paper calling for public submissions is due to be released this month—June 2007.

            <p>
             As I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, the Greens are concerned about enabling adequate labelling and notification of genetically modified food and we believe that the standards at the moment are lacking in that they do not require the provision of adequate information for people to assess the genetically modified content of the food that they are potentially buying. We have put forward a number of quite detailed amendments to ensure that food is adequately labelled to indicate whether the product contains genetically modified material and the nature of that genetically modified material.
            </p>
            <p>
             We think this is an important amendment that provides better disclosure to the community and to consumers, to enable them to make informed decisions. We believe it is appropriate to include this amendment to food standards because it relates directly to public health and safety and will ensure that people are fully informed. With all due respect, I hope that this is not another area that is under consultation and where we will have to ‘wait and see’. I appreciate there are processes being undertaken in a number of these areas, but a number of the answers we have had, last night and today, have been: ‘Just wait and see; this is under consultation.’ It is pleasing to see the government is taking these issues on board, but I would like to see something come out the other end.

              Labor supports full disclosure of genetic modification of food, but we will not be supporting this amendment. We cannot support full consultation and review processes in respect of these provisions because those full consultation review processes are not included. So we cannot support this particular amendment, but we want to have it on the record that we do support full disclosure and labelling for genetically modified food.

               just adopt Senator McLucas’s comments in terms of the process. Senator Siewert, you raise perhaps a legitimate issue about genetically modified food, but the problem again is—and I raised this last night in the debate—that amending this bill would not in fact have the outcome that you desire. It would take a change in the food standard, to be enforced at the state jurisdictional level, before any effect would be had with respect to genetically modified food. I understand what policy you wish to achieve, but that policy would not be achieved by what you seek to do here. So the government opposes this amendment.

                I appreciate the consistency of the government’s approach in terms of taking it to the states. Is the government considering putting this—and the other items that we have been discussing through this amendment process—on the agenda for the council?

                  I think we may be encouraging you to put this on the agenda. It is obvious, by the sound of it, that it has bipartisan support. It sounds like the

                  support it. You have indicated that some sort of notification would be appropriate. So I encourage the government to put this on the agenda.
