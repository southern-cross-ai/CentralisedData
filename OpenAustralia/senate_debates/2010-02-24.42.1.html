        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery. Does the minister agree with the statement made by the Prime Minister on the day that he was appointed as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery that he is ‘responsible directly for making sure that energy insulation is happening’?

         I have not seen that comment, but I have to say that, knowing the form of Senator Cormann, I am not going to take anything he says as gospel. I would certainly like to see the context, because the one thing we know about Senator Cormann is that he takes things out of context every day. I would have to see it before I would be happy to answer a question like that.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the past three days I have answered numerous questions about my role. I am again happy to put on record that my roles were to maximise job opportunities and to ensure the timely rollout of the stimulus package. As I have informed the Senate, when I became the Parliamentary Secretary for Government Service Delivery, I—along with the Coordinator-General, Mike Mrdak—met a few times with ministerial officers from departments that were responsible for delivering an element of the stimulus package. These meetings were designed to ensure strong reporting and lines of communication between Commonwealth agencies and state governments and to provide feedback between agencies, state governments and ministerial offices to ensure that the rollout of the stimulus was proceeding smoothly and on time. That is the role that I was playing. I would not be taking the words of Senator Cormann without actually seeing the document that he is quoting from.

             I refer to the minister’s answer yesterday, when he excused himself from the responsibility of raising safety concerns regarding the rollout of the rushed and failed Home Insulation Program with the Prime Minister on the grounds that at the time he was only the parliamentary secretary and not a minister. Given that his responsibilities as parliamentary secretary also included the Home Insulation Program, does he still maintain that he had no responsibility to inform the Prime Minister about the safety issues with the program, either as parliamentary secretary or as a minister?

              It is pretty clear that he got that question from Senator Abetz, because that was a complete misrepresentation of what I said yesterday. You are lucky that you did not get that by email. Minister Garrett, as the minister responsible, has always taken account of any element of risk identified during the course of the Home Insulation Program and has always taken action on advice to address these risks. The minister advises that, from the commencement of the program, his office was kept abreast of how the program was developing, the risk assessment processes that were underway, issues that arose during the assessment process, and the design and implementation of the Home Insulation Program. The minister further advises that this included participation in roundtables.

Has the minister checked his records, as he said he would yesterday, to ascertain whether any members of the Prime Minister’s personal staff were present at the regular meetings at which safety issues and risks in the Home Insulation Program were discussed?

                    Order! If you want to debate it, the time to debate it is after question time.

                     , on a point of order: I seek your guidance because the Leader of the Government tells us that we should ask the minister about when the minister first became aware of safety issues, and the minister does not answer. Who should we direct questions about safety issues to?

                      That is not a point of order; it is a debating point. You are quite entitled to debate that at the end of question time. That is when that should be debated.
