         Question

        : Does the Minister know how many very young carers, like Jazzi Pybus, who cares for both her parents at the very young age of 10, exist in Australia? Will the Minister explain why these very young carers are not considered important enough to have their voices heard at the federally funded

         Data on young carers
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In Australia, there are 170,600 young carers aged up to 17 years and 348,000 young carers aged up to 25 years.
        <sup>

        </sup>
        From a population perspective, 3.6% of young people aged up to 17 years are carers and 9% of young people aged 18-25 years. Around half the primary young carers are aged up to 17 years, and 80% aged between 18-25 years are female.

         more than one half of primary young carers are caring for a parent, and that parent is likely to be a mother and a sole-parent household

         it is estimated that one in four young carers are providing care for a person with a mental illness.

        These very young carers, like all young carers, are considered to be important and will have the opportunity to have their voices heard at the Young Carers “Bring it 2008” Forum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are 32 young carers who are being funded to come to Canberra to attend this event; four from each State and Territory, ensuring rural as well as urban representation. The young carers attending are also participating in a leadership program to help them represent young carer issues to politicians and to train to be mentors to other young carers when they return home. The leadership program has been designed at a level suitable for people aged fifteen and over and to get the most value out of the forum, participants have been chosen who are able to participate in both the leadership program and the forum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However all young carers can contribute to the forum by posting questions or comments they would like raised on the “Bring it” website (www.bringit2008.com.au). In addition, Carers Australia has been in touch with the young carer mentioned and offered to tell her story at the forum.
