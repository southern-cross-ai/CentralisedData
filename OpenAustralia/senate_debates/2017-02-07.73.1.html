        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Minister for Human Services,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Tudge" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Tudge
        </a>
        , who, in relation to the Centrelink debt recovery system, said: 'The system is working, and we will continue with that system.' I also refer to Senator Abetz, who said: 'The department's program was not as robust as it might have been.' Who is correct—Minister Tudge or Senator Abetz?

         Senator, I have not seen Sen Abetz's remarks, so I will not be commenting on them. But I can tell you, Senator, in relation to the issue that you raise that, while Australia has a generous, targeted and fair welfare system, Australians rightly expect that support should only be provided to those who need it. Everybody who relies on the welfare system are entitled to what their entitlements prescribe—nothing more and nothing less. Senator Cameron, if we are going to have a fair and generous welfare system in this country there has to be a system that ensures that there is not overpayment and that where there is overpayment that overpayment is recouped.
        </p>
        <p>
         The way the system works is that every relevant person receives a letter asking them to explain their circumstances. Where the Department of Health and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Social Services
         </a>
         have found a discrepancy between what that person told Centrelink that they earnt and information matched against the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
          ATO
         </a>
         —so if there is, evidently, a discrepancy between what the relevant person declared to Centrelink and what they declared in their return to the ATO—that data is matched. In the event that there is a discrepancy, the person concerned is asked to explain it. That is, Senator Cameron, a perfectly sensible way of identifying apparent discrepancies while at the same time—

           My point of order goes to relevance. The question was in relation to the Minister for Human Services,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Tudge" rel="nofollow">
            Alan Tudge
           </a>
           , and his quote saying, 'The system is working and we will continue with that system,' and the statement from Senator Abetz which said, 'The department's program was not as robust as it might have been.' The question was: who is correct? I do not think you can run away from that by simply saying, 'I didn't see Senator Abetz's claim.'

            Senator Cameron, there is no point of order because the minister indicated up-front that he is not aware of Senator Abetz's comments, so it would be unfair of the minister to respond accordingly.

                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
                  ATO
                 </a>
                 that is an obvious piece of data and when a person makes a declaration to Centrelink that is an obvious piece of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The inquiry covers the same issue—that is, their income—and, if on the matching of that data there is apparently a discrepancy, that discrepancy needs to be explained, and the person who is the welfare recipient is given an opportunity to explain it. Senator Cameron, we know that you and the Labor Party think that money grows on trees. That is at the heart of the Labor Party's

                   —Senator Cameron, as I said to you before, I am not familiar with Senator Abetz's commentary on this issue, but, if the words you attribute to him are accurately attributed, I do not agree with him.
