        It will improve right now. My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Can the minister please inform the Senate how the Albanese government is helping to combat gender inequality and improve the lives of women across the country? In particular, has the Albanese government responded to cost-of-living pressures, and how will delivering a tax cut to every single one of the 6.5 million hardworking women taxpayers assist?

         I thank Senator Smith for that excellent question, and I thank her and so many of my colleagues for their ongoing commitment to improving the position of working women in this country. We on this side of the chamber know that women's equality and financial security isn't just a nice-to-have; it's an economic and social imperative. Under our tax cuts, from this year, every working woman in Australia who pays tax will get a tax cut—6.5 million hardworking women, who make so many valuable contributions to our community, will pay less tax.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perhaps listen to this, Senator Ruston, before you interject again. The vast majority—nine in 10—will get a bigger tax cut than under Mr Morrison's plan. The Labor Party, the Albanese Labor government, want women to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. Treasury modelling also indicates that Labor's tax cuts will increase labour supply by twice as much as under Mr Morrison's plan, primarily because it will drive an increase in women's participation. That's what the Albanese Labor government's tax cuts do. Treasury advice says that this plan will help by enhancing the participation benefits of the tax cuts, especially for women, and distributing the future impact of bracket creep more evenly.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are a government that is already delivering positive economic outcomes for women. We are addressing the cost of living and reducing barriers to workforce participation. We are delivering cheaper child care, boosting paid parental leave, supporting economic security for single parents and ensuring that women get a fair deal at work. And now we have a tax plan which ensures that every Australian woman will pay less tax. You would have thought those opposite might be celebrating that.

           We know that women make up the majority of the workforce in so many critical professions, including our teachers, care workers in the aged sector, and nurses. We also know that these hardworking women are often on lower or middle incomes. Why is it so important that these workers get a bigger tax cut under Labor's tax plan?

            Thank you to Senator Smith. And Senator Smith is right: we do know that so many of the workers in lower-paid industries—teachers, care workers, workers in the aged-care sector and nursing—are women, and we know the extent to which that drives the gender pay gap. And we know why it's so important for women, for families and for all of us—for our economies—that that be remedied. Women make up 80 per cent of our primary school teachers, nurses and care workers. These are workers who deliver for our kids, for those who are sick, for those who are vulnerable. They are making invaluable contributions but, unfortunately, we know they are likely to be in low- and middle-income jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, Labor's tax cuts deliver for these women: 96 per cent of receptionists will be better off, as well as 97 per cent of registered nurses, 97 per cent of aged- and disability-care workers and 98 per cent of primary school teachers. This is Labor delivering for working women in this country.

               Thank you, Senator Smith. Well, the Treasury advice is crystal clear: Labor's tax cuts are the right move. We know that cost-of-living pressures have disproportionately impacted low- and middle-income households and we know that these tax cuts for all Australian taxpayers will help with that without adding to inflation. Of course we also know it's the right thing to do because those opposite—despite the hot air, despite the dramatic language, despite the fact that the deputy leader said, 'We will fight this legislation, even though we don't know what it looks like'—are voting for it. They're voting for it because they know in their heart of hearts that this is the right thing to do. It's the right thing to do for working women. It's the right thing to do for middle Australia. It is the right thing to do for our economy—
