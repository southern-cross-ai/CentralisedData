        rally took place in the Sydney Domain on 25 March 1928. It was organised by the Militant Women's Movement and called for equal pay for equal work, an eight-hour day for shop girls, no piece work, the basic wage for the unemployed and annual holidays on full pay. The day has been variously seen as a time for asserting women's political and social rights, for reviewing the progress that women have made or as a day for celebration.
