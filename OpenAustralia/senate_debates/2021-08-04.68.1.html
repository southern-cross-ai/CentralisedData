         I thank Senator Askew for that question. Indeed, I'm delighted to answer this question. Services Australia is truly the engine room of government support for all Australians. Throughout this pandemic, the Morrison government have ensured that services are delivered seamlessly and efficiently when and where they are needed most by Australians. We've quickly and efficiently bolstered the Australian Immunisation Register and myGov. We have applied fast-moving Centrelink payment changes and supported much-needed telehealth items through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
          MBS
         </a>
         . We have also paused debt raising and recovery in lockdown areas in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we make policy decisions, it's Services Australia that's on the receiving end of hundreds of thousands of claims, phone calls and questions. It's now setting and regularly breaking its own records for social security and welfare telephony and processing channels and also now for digital claims. In the past two months alone during these current lockdowns, it has approved over 1.4 million COVID disaster payments totalling $1.33 billion and it's supporting over 900,000 Australians. Yesterday alone more than 1,600 income support customers in New South Wales who have lost more than eight hours work applied for the additional support payment.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are so many ways to serve our nation either in or out of uniform. On behalf of all Australians I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart—and I'm sure yours—all Services Australia staff for their unwavering focus, urgency and momentum towards supporting Australians during natural disasters. Their work is sometimes an unsung service to their nation. I know many Australians are very grateful for their service.

            At every stage of the pandemic the Morrison government has adjusted to support Australians and ensure that services are delivered seamlessly, efficiently and as quickly as we can. Services Australia have mobilised more than 18,000 internal and external staff to ensure that calls and claims for the COVID-19 disaster payment are processed as quickly as possible. In some cases that has been as quick as being in the bank in 40 minutes.
           </p>
           <p>
            What does this mobilisation look like? It includes over 600 new staff and over 250

            surge staff from other departments and agencies. Over 4,000 agency staff who usually undertake other roles have been redeployed to this effort and over 13,000 staff from the customer service delivery group are prioritising the COVID-19 disaster payment at this time. I again thank them for their efforts and work in stepping up and supporting all Australians.

                CALD

               communities. We do understand the challenges faced by many of these communities, particularly in

                Western Sydney
               </a>
               at the moment. Our government, through Services Australia, is ensuring that information available on support is accessible to all Australians, with content now translated into 63 different languages to help many of those communities. Multicultural service officers are also working directly with the community. Also in language interviews have been made available to provide information about this payment. The payment is available to Australian residents and eligible working visa holders who meet the eligibility criteria. People can also call 131202 to talk to Services Australia in languages other than English.
