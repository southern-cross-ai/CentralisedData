        I rise to speak about Postcards to the Front. Started by Tamara Levit in Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, this initiative invites people from around the world to send short messages of hope and solidarity via postcards to the brave Ukrainians on the front line of the war with Russia. These frontline heroes include not just soldiers but also doctors, nurses, aid workers and many others who are risking their lives to help their countrymen and defend their country against Russia's illegal and immoral invasion. The Australian branch of this volunteer-run initiative has sent over 2,000 postcards. The campaign is picking up, with more than half of these cards sent in the last month.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I invited all members and senators to participate in this campaign by posting them a blank postcard with a reply-paid envelope and a covering letter with suggestions of what to write. I sincerely thank the more than 33 members and senators who have so far returned cards to my office, including the Prime Minister. These postcards may seem like a small, even token, gesture, but they are important. Ukrainians have fought with admirable determination, and I believe the courage and fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people has been a key to their success in the war. Together with the substantial material support we are providing, the postcards are a reminder that the world stands with Ukraine and has not and will not forget their struggle. Any member or senator who has not yet returned their card in the post can drop it off at my parliament suite, where I also have a supply of blank cards. All you have to do is write your message on the card and leave it with my staff. My office will then forward it to Postcards to the Front Australia, who will ensure it gets delivered to the front line.
