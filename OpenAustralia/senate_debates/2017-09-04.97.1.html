        communities, my question is to Senator Scullion. I have just come back from a nine-day road visit to the cape, visiting all communities except Aurukun, where a planned visit was postponed due to sorry business after two deaths in the community. I listened to people across the cape and learned much about what is lacking in the area and I felt the enormous commitment locals of all races have together to taking opportunities for regional development.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Scullion, as Minister for Indigenous Affairs, are you aware that many traditional owners or custodians across the cape feel left behind by the Indigenous Affairs hierarchy—that is, the Commonwealth funded and state funded agencies and bodies? Are you aware that people are crying out for locally driven solutions to social and economic challenges because real, practical outcomes are not possible under current programs, as shown in the appalling results in the latest
        <i>
         Closing the gap

        report and in the lack of practical resources for seizing community opportunities?

         I thank the senator for his question and his interest in this matter. It was good of him to actually visit remote areas of Australia. I think it was last week that I met and spoke to representatives of every single traditional owner group on the cape. They met at Djarragun, not far from Cairns, and their particular matter was about bringing together a new governance arrangement for the entire cape so the 13 prescribed body corporates would be completely represented. They didn't do that only because of governance arrangements; they also did it because they believe it gives them self-government, if you like, and a way that they can make decisions across the board that they haven't been able to make before.
        </p>
        <p>
         You may not be aware, Senator Roberts, but there has recently been a native title claim over the cape that basically fills in the gaps—all 13 prescribed body corporates fill that area. There was clearly a decision, I'm happy to report, that they will now be moving towards having a regional council, instead of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Land Council
         </a>
         , that represents all those traditional owner interests across the cape. I have to say that I have rarely been as excited as about the proposal that was put to the government. It's not a matter for me; they were just simply informing me of the things that they intend to do. So, the Indigenous people of the cape, the Aboriginal people of the cape themselves—and there were some people from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait
         </a>
         there, as well—have decided on regional governance that is without precedent since Federation. It is going to be able to utilise the synergies; it is going to be able to take in the local government bodies—everyone was there. I can assure you that, in terms of empowerment in the cape, they cannot be in any safer hands—the safest are theirs.

           at the same time I was on the ground in the cape. Are you aware that many traditional owners or custodians of the cape are feeling their native title interests are not being adequately represented by their regional land council, and would you be interested in discussing this further to ensure funds and resources are getting to everyday people across the cape?

            when I was in Cairns. I met with the representatives of 13 prescribed body corporates, which are the traditional owner groups of every element of the cape. There are always going to be groups in the fringe that don't agree necessarily. Let's face it, if we in this place had to get 100 per cent, I don't think we'd ever get a parliament together. Just like in any organisation there are dissenters. I meet with those dissenters regularly, but, certainly, if there are some people I haven't already met with whom you particularly want me to meet with, I would be delighted to do so. But I don't think it's reasonable to say that the funds that are being provided and the advice that's being provided, either by the

These are matters that are usually determined by the native title tribunal. As I said, it is not uncommon for a few people to disagree—remember, I spoke to 300 traditional owners who represent the cape. This matter, I know, is a bit of a focus for those people who are outside of that process. I am not sure where we're up to with either the Attorney-General's Department or my department, but, in regard to my department, on notice I'll attempt to provide answers to the senator on the matters in that letter.
