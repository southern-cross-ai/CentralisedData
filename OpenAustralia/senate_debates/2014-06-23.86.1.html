        My question is to the Minister for Human Services, Senator Payne, representing the Minister for Education. Can the minister explain how the government's higher education reform package spreads opportunity to more Australian students?

         I thank Senator Ruston very much for her question. I am very happy to talk about the government's higher education reform package. It is a fair and balanced package which is going to spread opportunity for students and ensure that Australia is not left behind in global competition. We believe in the transformational power of higher education. That is why we will be providing $37 billion in funding to higher education institutions over the next four financial years. For the first time ever, all Australian undergraduate students in registered higher education institutions will be supported for all accredited courses, from higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas, associate degrees to bachelor degrees, whether they choose to study for those qualifications at universities,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         s or private colleges. That means that over 80,000 additional students a year will be supported by the Commonwealth by 2018 as a result of these reforms. That is what spreading opportunity is all about.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those reforms are going to include support for students in pathway programs which prepare them for university study. They provide effective support for students who might otherwise not be able to get to university but often do better than students who might not have come through the pathway program. Students supported through those pathway programs often come from low
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
          SES
         </a>
         backgrounds, and presently many of those students either cannot get a place or have to pay more for one than for Commonwealth-supported undergraduate places. This higher education reform package will address this issue. We are providing real opportunities for universities and other higher education providers across the diversity of the spectrum throughout Australia.

           We are also providing uncapped support for all Australian undergraduates wherever they choose to study, a strong and sustainable student loan program which treats all students fairly, and also new Commonwealth scholarships to assist with living costs. Alongside those higher education reforms we are also introducing

           scholarships will be funded by $1 in every $5 of additional revenue that universities and other higher education institutions earn as a result of the deregulation of the higher education systemâ€”and they will support disadvantaged students, students from regional Australia, Indigenous students and a range of other students who are not currently able to access higher education institutions. The reform package will also provide
