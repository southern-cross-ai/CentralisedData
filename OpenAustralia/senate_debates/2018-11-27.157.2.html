           -National government has zero tolerance for violence against women and works with all jurisdictions to keep women and children safe. The government has invested over $300 million to improve women's safety since 2015, focusing on practical measures that reduce the incidence of violence and supporting victims and their children. The government is developing the fourth action plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. Legislation is currently before the parliament to provide a minimum standard of five days of unpaid domestic violence leave, as recommended by the Fair Work Commission.

              There is no doubt that many people, not only women but men as well, are in crisis when it comes to domestic violence. My motion on 19 September called on the federal government to fill the data-sharing gaps as outlined in the

              is unfortunately the domestic violence capital of Australia, and we know that the effect and impact domestic violence has on children is devastating. My motion earlier this year urged the federal government to provide more relief housing and crisis accommodation for all victims of domestic violence. With the festive season just around the corner, when domestic violence tends to spike, it is vital that all levels of government do their bit to provide a safe haven for Australians in need.
