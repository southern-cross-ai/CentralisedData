        My question is to the minister representing the Treasurer in the Senate today, Senator Conroy. Can the minister inform the Senate on the latest unemployment figures announced last Thursday? In particular, can the minister provide some comparison of how the levels of Australian employment and job creation have fared compared with those of other developed economies during the global financial crisis?

         ’s employment figures demonstrate the resilience of Australian employers and employees throughout the global recession. Unemployment in Australia, at 5.3 per cent, is lower than that of any of the major advanced economies except Japan, with the Australian economy creating around 180,000 jobs in the past year. That is a remarkable achievement given what has occurred elsewhere in the world. Since the start of the global recession, 6.8 million jobs have been lost in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         , which now has an unemployment rate of 9.7 per cent. Three million jobs have been lost across the Euro economies, which now have an average unemployment rate of 9.9 per cent, and half a million jobs have been lost in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         , with an unemployment rate of 7.8 per cent. We know that this performance would not have been as strong if it had not been for the quick and decisive action of this government in investing in our economy and supporting Australian jobs. The cornerstone of this has been the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, over half of which has now been delivered. Without that quick and decisive action, hundreds of thousands of Australians would have been unemployed. As Governor Stevens said last week on the first of the month, the stimulus measures, both fiscal and monetary, have worked a treat.

           The action taken by the government is in stark contrast to the attitude of those opposite. They are focused on saying no to absolutely everything—no to economic stimulus to support the jobs of working Australians, no to the Fair Work Act, because they would rather go back to

            Work Choices
           </a>
           , and no to greater telecommunications competition and consumer protection. The list continues. These latest unemployment figures demonstrate just how wrong the Liberal Party were to vote against the stimulus that has kept Australia out of recession and has saved the jobs—

                      My point is that the opposition seems to have embarked on a tactic today of totally disrupting question time. It is, of course, the time for them to hold the government to account and it is obviously their decision, if that is their tactic. I would urge you to insist that the ministers be allowed to answer their questions with some modicum of silence in the chamber.

                       There is no point of order. Ministers are entitled and questioners are entitled to be heard in silence. As I repeatedly say, the time for debating these issues—if there needs to be robust debate—is at the end of question time, not during question time itself.

                        have warned against too rapid a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, completely repudiating the calls from those opposite. To quote the IMF on 2 March:
                       </p>
                       <p class="italic">
                        The still fragile nature of the global recovery suggests that the withdrawal of the policy stimulus should proceed gradually.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        If those opposite are still not getting the message, the OECD also said in February of this year:
                       </p>
                       <p class="italic">
                        The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus will have to be carefully planned.
