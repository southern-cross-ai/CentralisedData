        My question is to Senator Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. Can the minister advise the Senate about the education investments forming part of the government’s economic stimulus strategy. How do these investments relate to the rest of the strategy; at what point did the government decide to target spending on education infrastructure as a way of cushioning Australia against the global crisis; which parts of the education system have received support; does support extend to primary, secondary, vocational and university education; and how many Australian schools, teachers and students are expected to benefit from these investments?

         collapsed a year ago, the world stared into an abyss. This government has pulled Australia back from that abyss. It is too early to sound the all clear, especially when so many countries are in deep recession, yet there is no doubt that the government’s response has shielded Australia from the worst effects of the global downturn. Our first action was to stabilise domestic financial markets. The next step was to launch a three-stage fiscal stimulus strategy focusing, first, on cash transfers to underpin short-term demand; second, on small-scale shovel-ready infrastructure to support jobs and business; and, third, on long-term investment in nation-building infrastructure. Education has been the focus of the government’s stimulus strategy since day one.

           . In February, we announced the biggest single investment ever made in Australian schools. That investment delivered new and upgraded classrooms, playgrounds, libraries, halls, science centres and language laboratories around the country. It benefited 9½ thousand schools, it helped a quarter of a million teachers and it helped 3½ million primary and secondary school students.

             and university systems. They are benefiting the communities that will use these school halls. They are benefiting employers, who will have access to a better skilled workforce. They are benefiting the industries that will draw on university research to help develop new products, new services and new processes. They are benefiting our colleagues on the opposition benches. They will come in here and they will try to mow down the government’s efforts to give Australians a better education, then they will have to go back to their own electorates, to their own communities, and have to try to claim credit for the government’s work. We have seen this again, this morning, with the government’s automotive legislation, where the opposition has been through all sorts of contortions and backflips.

               Our stimulus strategy is expected to support 210,000 jobs. A lot of those jobs have been underpinned by investments in education, whether it be for 100 construction workers in Newcastle, 12 architects in Melbourne, 250 building people in Canberra, including 50 apprentices, or the 50 tradies and 30 apprentices in
