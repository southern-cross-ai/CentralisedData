        Jeff Bezos was the first person in history to build a personal fortune worth more than

        $200 billion. Despite his wealth going up by $13 million an hour 2020, Amazon workers face dangerous working conditions, especially during the COVID pandemic, and have had little or no increase to their pay. Amazon has retaliated against workers who have made efforts to collectively organise for better pay and conditions. In Australia, the

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        have represented Amazon workers who have experienced wage theft, unsafe conditions and unfair sackings. Couriers and truck drivers across the transport industry have taken industrial action to stop the 'Amazon effect' because Amazon's actions have driven down pay and conditions across the entire industry.

        Amazon conducts surveillance of its warehouse workers and has admitted to calling the police on

        organisers engaging in lawful right of entry. While hugely profitable, Amazon's tax arrangements mean it barely pays any income tax in the countries where it derives most of its revenue. Amazon paid zero tax in the United States in 2017 and 2018. Despite breaking through the $1 billion revenue barrier in Australia last year, Amazon paid little more than $20 million in Australian income tax. By not paying its fair share of taxes, it's ripping off public services, like health and education, not just in Australia but throughout the world. While Mr Bezos has acknowledged the climate crisis, Amazon's carbon footprint is greater than that of two-thirds of the world's countries. Citizens across the globe are starting to unite with Amazon workers, political representatives and civil society organisations to push back against Amazon's poor record on workers' rights. (
