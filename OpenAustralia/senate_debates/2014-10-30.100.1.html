          As a minister that has dedicated himself to assisting the nation to rid itself of the carbon tax and the mining tax, to getting the budget back into shape, to doing all the things that this nation so desperately needs, it will not surprise the viewing public and honourable senators here to learn that, no, I have not dedicated my scarce resources to such a silly, frivolous exercise as that undertaken by the Leader of the Opposition in this place. What it shows us is how devoid of alternative policies the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Labor Party
          </a>
          actually is. That the former failed finance minister could come in here and ask me, 'Have you bothered to check who might be the longest stood aside minister since Federation?' is indicative of the policy bankruptcy of the Australian Labor Party. That is why I can say to the honourable Leader of the Opposition: well may she pursue those issues; she will not have me join her on these silly escapades, because we are devoting ourselves to running the country in a manner that will see benefits flow for our fellow Australians.
         </p>
         <p>
          So,

           Mr President
          </a>
          , you and honourable senators and the viewing public have been given a wonderful window into the difference between the Labor Party's activities in this place and what we as a coalition are doing in this place. We are getting on with the business of government. We are fixing the ills that were put to us.

           , I ask a supplementary question. Was the press release issued by Treasury last Friday in the name of Senator Sinodinos a signal of the Prime Minister's intention to reinstall Senator Sinodinos as Assistant Treasurer after parliament rises or just further evidence of the shambolic and incompetent Abbott government? You cannot even get your ministers right.

            Senator Wong has done the Australian community a great favour. Just in case the Australian community was labouring under the misapprehension that this was an infallible government, she has pointed out the fact that a typographical error occurred on a media release, which I understand has since been corrected.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do errors occur from time to time? Yes, they do. One of the distinctions between the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Labor Party
            </a>
            , and the left wing of Australian politics, and the coalition side of politics is simply this: we accept that there is such a thing as human frailty, that we are not perfect and that, when errors occur, we are willing to acknowledge them, apologise for them and correct them, which is exactly what happened in relation to this administrative error.
