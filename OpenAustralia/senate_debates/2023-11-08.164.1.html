         Thank you, Senator Colbeck. I'm very conscious, of course, as the minister for agriculture and fisheries, of the issues that Senator Colbeck is referring to. I've been working very closely with Minister Plibersek around the issues relating to salmon farming on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          West Coast
         </a>
         of Tasmania and, of course, ensuring that the views and concerns of the salmon industry and the many people who work for it are considered in any government decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
         I don't quite agree with the characterisation of Minister Plibersek's actions that you have put forward, Senator Colbeck. I don't consider that she has made threats to close down the industry. What she is actually doing at the moment is observing a legal process. There are a number of groups who have asked her—and made a formal application—to reconsider various environmental approvals that have previously been provided. She has a legal obligation to consider that request, and that is what she is doing at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
         What you will also find is that Minister Plibersek and our government have actually provided significant amounts of funding—in the millions of dollars—

           Thank you, President, I have a point of order on direct relevance. I did ask the minister to advise on the number of jobs at threat based on Minister Plibersek's threats. They are genuine threats that were made in a letter from the minister to the Tasmanian Premier this week.

             Thank you, President, and thank you, Senator Colbeck. I have already acknowledged that there are significant numbers of workers in the salmon industry on the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast" rel="nofollow">
              West Coast
             </a>
             of Tasmania, as there are across Tasmania as a whole. The interests of those workers and the companies they work for are something in the forefront of the government's mind. The reality is that Minister Plibersek has now received an application from a number of groups to reconsider those environmental approvals. It wouldn't matter whether it were a Labor minister or a Liberal minister or a National Party minister; they are legally obliged to consider that request and that is what Minister Plibersek is considering.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I was attempting to say is that the government has already provided funding to support the salmon industry and reduce the oxygen levels in

                Thanks, Senator Colbeck. Senator Colbeck would remember from his time as a minister that ministers don't provide guarantees of the sort that he is requiring. I can remember many occasions when we attempted to get guarantees from ministers, including Senator Colbeck, on various situations, and those guarantees weren't made and, of course, can't be made. But what I can guarantee is that the Albanese government is a strong supporter of the salmon industry in Tasmania, and its backing that up not just with words but with funding.
               </p>
               <p>
                Minister Plibersek has announced $2.1 million in Australian government funding to establish a captive breeding program to help the maugean skate—something that the salmon industry requested that we do. We've also, through the Fisheries Research and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
                 Development Corporation
                </a>
                and the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, partnered with industry in a new initiative worth up to $6 million to stimulate dissolved oxygen levels in
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
                 Macquarie Harbour
                </a>
                . So we are taking action to work with the industry around the environmental issues that have been raised.

                  Salmon workers in Tasmania will be pleased to know there are no guarantees. Minister, Christmas is approaching, and Australians are now further engulfed in Labor's cost-of-living crisis, yet Minister Plibersek is creating even more anxiety for Tasmanians with her inability to provide certainty to the thousands of workers collectively employed in the salmon industry in Tasmania, the
