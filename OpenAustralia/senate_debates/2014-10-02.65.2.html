        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson. I refer to the recent budget cuts to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        's travelling exhibition program and the claim by the minister's spokesperson that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWM" rel="nofollow">
         AWM
        </a>
        was advised by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        in May that, because of the requirement to fund a number of initiatives, the travelling exhibitions program was under review. I also refer to comments by the Australian War Memorial that: 'At no stage before Thursday, 14th of August, were we given any indication that future funding for the travelling exhibitions was at risk.' Who is correct: the minister or the Australian War Memorial?

         I can only assume that Senator Conroy bought some fish and chips over the weekend, because, quite frankly, this was in the papers about three weeks ago. He is hardly on top of his brief if he has had to wait this amount of time. Let me be absolutely clear about our relationship with the

          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         and then I will compare it with that of the

          Australian Labor Party

          , the point of order goes to direct relevance under the standing orders. In fact, the minister has flagged his intention not to be directly relevant. He spoke about what he would say. There is only one question in the question put by Senator Conroy: 'Who is correct?' We have a factual statement from the minister's spokesperson and a factual statement from the War Memorial. They are inconsistent. The minister is simply asked: 'Who is correct?'

           Thank you, Senator Wong. I do agree there was one question. But can I tell you I am having a lot of difficulty, particularly because of you, Senator Carr, in hearing part of the answer. I indicate to the minister that he has one minute and 25 seconds left to answer the question and advise the minister of the question.

            What Senator Conroy should be aware of in relation to decisions made about the travelling exhibition—the smaller travelling exhibition, not the national travelling exhibition; I presume he knows the difference between the two—is that this government inherited a situation in veterans affairs where we have 72,000—

It was not about the value; it was about when the

They were advised in May that it was under review. The decision was made in August. The imputation in Senator Conroy's question is that this was a stroke of the pen in early August without any notification that it was under review. Quite frankly, I am not concerned about what the opposition has apparently got off the back of a truck. I know that in May, because of the requirement for us to fund—

                          was advised that, because of the requirement to fund other initiatives, this program was under review. Some of those initiatives, Senator Conroy, you might be interested in. A part of them is engagement with the 72,000 contemporary veterans who have served this nation since 1999. You should be aware, Senator Conroy, that we are trying to ensure that the mistakes that this nation made post-Vietnam are not repeated for these men and women. We are determined to ensure that they have the best access to mental health services, they know what mental health services are being provided and we are engaging these contemporary veterans in a fora that they understand—that is social media and other—
