        The bill amends special appropriations in the

        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill enables the delivery of the Future Fellowships scheme consistent with the 2008-09 Budget measure
        <i>
         Future Fellowships – Establishment
        </i>
        . Future Fellowships are an election commitment through the 14 November Media Release entitled
        <i>
         Keeping Our Best And Brightest In Australia – Labor’s Future Fellowships
        </i>
        . The Future Fellowships are anticipated to be delivered commencing early (first quarter) calendar year 2009. To provide a basis for this expenditure, the amendments in the bill increase funding to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC" rel="nofollow">
         ARC
        </a>
        schemes via special appropriation. Passage of this legislation by the end of the Spring sittings will enable expenditure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Secondly, the bill provides indexation for ARC existing schemes. As indexation is included as part of this bill, it follows that there is not excess funding within the Australian Research Council to otherwise provide funding for the Future Fellowships.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thirdly, the bill creates a new out year financial forward estimate in the funding profile.

         Purpose of the bill

        The bills establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body to improve occupational health and safety (

         OHS

        ) outcomes and workers’ compensation arrangements in Australia.

       <p class="italic">
        Safe Work Australia will be an inclusive, tripartite body representing the interests of the Commonwealth, the

         States and Territories
        </a>
        as well as workers and employers in Australia. Safe Work Australia will be a reform-focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers’ Council (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRMC" rel="nofollow">
         WRMC
        </a>
        ).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bills play a pivotal role in realising the Government’s commitment to work cooperatively with State and Territory governments to harmonise OHS legislation and improve OHS outcomes and workers’ compensation arrangements in Australia

       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has committed to work in partnership with the States and Territories to harmonise key laws and regulations, including OHS regulation, within five years of coming to office. OHS regulation was identified as a key area of reform at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        ) meeting in December 2007. At the COAG meeting of 3 July 2008, members signed an intergovernmental agreement for regulatory and operational reform and agreed to harmonise OHS legislation by 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The establishment of an independent statutory body, and related legislation, is central to the Government’s policy to improve OHS outcomes and workers’ compensation arrangements in Australia. Safe Work Australia will be responsible for preparing a model act and model regulations to be considered by WRMC for adoption by the Commonwealth and States and Territories. In order to fulfil the election commitment it is imperative that the legislation establishing the body be passed early in the Spring sittings, to ensure that Safe Work Australia is able to meet the Government’s timetable.
