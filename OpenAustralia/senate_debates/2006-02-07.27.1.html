        </a>
        and the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Is the minister aware of the alleged actions of Senator Heffernan in abusing his Senate and coalition colleague Senator Nash at Canberra airport yesterday? Can the minister indicate whether the Prime Minister finds such behaviour to be acceptable? If not, can the minister explain what action has been taken to discipline Senator Heffernan? Given Senator Heffernan’s past record, does the Prime Minister believe that his apology is sufficient or does he agree with The Nationals MP Ms De-Anne Kelly that the actions constitute workplace harassment and should be treated more seriously? Wouldn’t the failure to take more serious action effectively condone Senator Heffernan’s repeated attempts to intimidate fellow coalition senators?

         This really does demonstrate what a pathetic opposition we have. They have already run out of questions on what they said was going to be the big killer issue this week. They were going to come in here and really take the government to task on the whole

         issue. Then Mr Beazley had to wave the white flag very quickly by saying, ‘We’re not going to get any scalps.’ Already, after a few questions, they have given up on AWB. They have taken their question from listening to the six o’clock news on the ABC this morning, which reported, on my information, in quite an exaggerated fashion a conversation that took place between Senator Heffernan and Senator Nash.

           I am trying to answer their question, but they are trying to drown me out. They are obviously not interested in the answer. I will try and answer the question if the opposition do not interrupt me. I am not sure that this is an appropriate form of question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister; nevertheless, I can inform Senator Evans that I undertook, as

             I have received assurances from both Senator Nash, who believes that she did not feel intimidated at all by Senator Heffernan, and Senator Heffernan, who wished to make it clear that in no terms was he seeking to intimidate Senator Nash. Of course we all know Senator Heffernan is quite a mild, meek and humble fellow, and we do not find him intimidating at all. Senator Nash certainly does not. I can assure the opposition that this coalition remains strong, united and determined to bring good government to this country and to repair the damage caused by 13 years of Labor.

              , I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister is dismissive of Senator Heffernan’s behaviour. That probably explains why you were so keen to accept Senator McGauran into the Liberal Party despite his actions recently. What message does it send if the government condones this sort of action? Aren’t Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce right when they say that Senator Heffernan ought to be held accountable for his behaviour? Shouldn’t the government treat this sort of behaviour more seriously rather than trying to dismiss it and to blame the media for the actions of a person who is a repeat offender, who tries to intimidate his colleagues and acts in an inappropriate manner? Surely the government must take some responsibility.

               This is an extraordinary question from Senator Evans. He was not present when this alleged conversation took place. He has no idea what was said between the two parties. Both parties, as I have said in this place, have assured us—the government, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister—that they had a conversation which was overheard by others but that Senator Nash took no offence and Senator Heffernan meant none. This is a facile question and it is a waste of question time.
