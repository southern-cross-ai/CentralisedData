        (i) the current compulsory country of origin labelling regime in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        for seafood sold for immediate consumption, and the benefits it has provided to consumers, retailers and the fishing and aquaculture industries, and
       </p>
       <p>
        (ii) the findings of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report
        <i>
         Current requirements for labelling of seafood and seafood products, and particularly in relation to the economic benefits of extending such a mandatory scheme across Australia, including:
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        '3.61 The committee holds the view that mandating country of origin labelling in relation to fish products sold in restaurants and other cooked seafood outlets comprises an effective, simple and cost-effective means of achieving a level playing field for Australian and overseas seafood producers. To this end, the committee recommends the immediate removal of the exemption under Standard 1.2.11of the Code', and
       </p>
       <p>
        the following recommendation:
       </p>
       <p>
        '3.63 The committee recommends that the exemption regarding country of origin labelling under Standard 1.2.11 of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code for cooked or pre-prepared seafood sold by the food services sector be removed, subject to a transition period of no more than 12 months'; and
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) calls on the Government to take urgent action to introduce a compulsory country of origin labelling regime for seafood sold for immediate consumption within no later than the next 12 months.

           The government appreciates the intent of this motion but we cannot support it. We recognise that the sponsors of this motion are very concerned about country-of-origin labelling. As the government we recognise that consumers want to know the origin of their food and the government has made considerable progress on country-of-origin labelling. We also note that the senators concerned work on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry into seafood labelling and acknowledge the hard work of that committee in the inquiry process.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government is currently considering its response to the recommendations from the inquiry into the current requirements of the labelling of seafood and seafood products. We are continuing to consult with the industry on this issue. The government is precluded from acting unilaterally to introduce a compulsory regime. As stated previously in the chamber, the Commonwealth has limited legislative power in the area of food regulation and although standards may be developed by

           , their development enforcement is undertaken in collaboration between and are reliant upon state and territory legislation in

              I am disappointed with the coalition's response, notwithstanding that there were many coalition senatorsâ€”including from the National Partyâ€”who had made a terrific contribution to the Senate committee inquiry on changing the law. We can make a difference, in terms of seafood labelling. That will make a huge difference to Australian jobs in this country. Thousands of jobs could be created.
             </p>
             <p>
              I acknowledge Senator Nigel Scullion's work in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
               Northern Territory
              </a>
              . He was the pioneer who got this through in the Northern Territory, where it has been a terrific success. So to say that the Commonwealth cannot act unilaterally, to say that it is all too hardâ€”with respect to the government, if there is a political will on the part of the Commonwealth to show leadership from government, they can do it. I have contrary advice that says that it can be done. But I do want to genuinely acknowledge the coalition senators who have supported this privately and publicly, and I hope that sooner rather than later we will have these seafood labelling laws so that Australian consumers know what they are buying in their restaurant or takeaway shop.
