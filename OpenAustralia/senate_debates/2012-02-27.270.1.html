        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Each Panel member of the Fair Work Act Review (Review) is being paid $550 per hour (including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         ) for a maximum of eight hours a day. The appointments are part-time and Panel members will be remunerated for actual time worked, not for each day of the Review period.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Department_of_Education" rel="nofollow">
          The Department of Education
         </a>
         , Employment and Workplace Relations is providing secretariat support for the Panel.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The department sought advice from the Office of Best Practice Regulation (OBPR) regarding the requirements of a post-implementation review (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIR" rel="nofollow">
          PIR
         </a>
         ). The terms of reference for the Review were assessed by the OBPR as meeting those requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Yes, as the OBPR has advised the department that it considers the Review to be in conformity with its requirements for a PIR.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) Draft terms of reference and individuals who might be considered to conduct the Review were initially provided to the office of the former Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_Education" rel="nofollow">
          Tertiary Education
         </a>
         , Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations on 19 October 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) The department did not identify the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         as a potential organisation to undertake the Review. This is because it was considered important that the person or persons undertaking the Review have a practical knowledge and appreciation of contemporary workplace relations issues and practices.
