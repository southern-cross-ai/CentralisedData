         These questions have already been answered in the Budget Estimates response on the Budget Audit Review asked in writing by Senator Johnston. The Minister's answer stated that,

         support functions) that were agreed by Government and have previously been published by Defence. Defence therefore reports against these more robust targets, rather than against the gaps (or potential opportunities) initially identified.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Defence is reporting bi-annually to government on progress towards agreed SRP outcomes, including the achievement of annual cost reductions. The achievement during first year of SRP implementation is detailed in the 2009-10 Defence Annual Report. Defence is due to report to Government on its SRP performance during 2010-11 in the second half of this year, following finalisation of its financial statements. Details on the achievement of 2010-11 cost reduction targets will be included in the 2010-11 Annual Report.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Defence notes that the Government has committed to a five-year rolling program of White Papers. As part of this process a new DBA will be commissioned to inform the development of the next paper. It is likely that this audit would re-consider the performance of support functions against appropriate benchmarks, and thus provide an update on improvements in Defence efficiency.
