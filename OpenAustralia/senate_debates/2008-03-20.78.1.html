         I thank the senator for her question and for the opportunity to dispel a popular myth put about those opposite. Contrary to their propaganda, this government sees that telecommunications services are of critical importance to Australians living in rural and regional areas. Telecommunications—and in particular access to high-speed broadband—allows the tyranny of distance to be overcome. Anyone with a real understanding of the needs of rural Australia recognises that fact.
        </p>

         Only yesterday, Dr Glasson of the Regional Telecommunications Review commented on the importance of broadband to education in regional areas.

             Senator Brandis may not be interested in these views, but Dr Glasson said that many parents have told him that the lack of broadband is impeding their children’s education. Unlike the former government, this government’s national broadband plan will benefit all Australians. We are building a high-speed fibre network that will deliver minium speeds of 12 megabits per second to 98 per cent of homes and businesses. I remind the chamber that those opposite preferred to restrict high-speed fibre networks to only metropolitan areas. That is the process the former minister put in place only last year. As per our election commitment, Australians who do not get access through the new national broadband network will have access to broadband via the best available satellite, wireless and fixed line technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last week I announced that the government will provide an additional $95 million to fund the Australian Broadband Guarantee in 2008-09. This announcement once again seems to have missed the opposition’s attention. Only yesterday, the member for Wannon was quoted in the press accusing the government of remaining silent on the Australian Broadband Guarantee. May I remind the chamber that it is those opposite who were silent on this issue. Despite all the rhetoric of telecommunications in rural and regional areas, those opposite did not provide any details about ongoing funding for the

             in the lead-up to the federal election. Not one cent was in their promises going forward into the federal election. Conversely, Labor stated that they would continue to support the Australian Broadband Guarantee, and the $95 million commitment is consistent with our election promise. This government is committed to ensuring all Australians have ongoing access to high-speed—
