        My question is to Minister Wong in her capacity representing the Prime Minister. Minister, I'm asking this question on behalf of Australia but also

         I thank Senator Shoebridge for his question. I'd make a few points about Mr Assange. I understand that there is strong interest in the case, that there is a depth of community sentiment, and we have made clear publicly, before the election and since, that the government's view is that Mr Assange's case has dragged on too long and should be brought to a close. It is not generally my practice to give chapter and verse of everything that is said in every diplomatic communication. But in the interests of transparency on this issue I have said that I have personally expressed this view—the view that Mr Assange's case has dragged on long enough and should be brought to a close—to the government of the United States and the government of the United Kingdom, and I will continue to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister has also made clear in the parliament, and I'd refer you to his answers, that he has raised this case at the appropriate levels. What I would say is this—and you would know this, Senator Shoebridge, as a lawyer. We are not able, as an Australian government, to intervene in another country's legal or court processes.

          Well, it is true. You would understand—
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Shoebridge, there is a thing called the rule of law. There is a principle called the separation of powers. No amount of bellowing at me from that end of the chamber is going to change the fact that a court has to determine the legal process. So, we can raise these issues, as I have and as the Prime Minister has. But we are not able to alter the judicial processes of another country.

                 That isn't what I said, and you've made a set of assertions that may or may not be true. I would again say that we have at the Prime Minister's level and at foreign minister level been very clear in our views that this matter has dragged on too long and it should be brought to a close. But I again make the point that there is a legal process which is in accordance with the tradition of the separation of powers, which I regard as an important part of democracy. It is not something that the Australian government can resolve. Having said that, it is appropriate—

                      The Prime Minister has made his views clear about this matter having dragged on too long. But I again would make this point: whilst we are doing what we can between government and government, there are limits until Mr Assange has concluded the legal processes.

If you perhaps listened to what I'm saying, Senator Shoebridge, what I'm saying to you is that, while soever there are legal proceedings on foot, it is very difficult for there to be resolution between governments. I think that is an observation of fact.
