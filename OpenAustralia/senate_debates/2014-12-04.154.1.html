       <p>
        As a result of the success of the government's strong border protection management policies, the Australian government has been able to restore offshore places within the humanitarian program for vulnerable people waiting overseas to be resettled. The first amendment I am moving proposes to add a new schedule 2A to the bill to progressively increase Australia's humanitarian program over the next four years so that by the financial year commencing 1 July 2018 Australia's annual humanitarian intake will increase from its current level of 13,750 places to 18,750 places. This will be done through two successive increases of 2½ thousand places in each of the 2017-18 and the 2018-19 programs. The government will also maintain the size of the program over the next two years at no less than 13,750 places in each year. The amendments set out these commitments within the Migration Act 1958, and they will provide clarity and certainty for the Australian public. The proposed government amendments will provide certainty about the size of the humanitarian program in the coming years and demonstrate the government's commitment to a strong and orderly humanitarian intake, focused on those overseas most in need of resettlement. The government considers these amendments to be a public commitment to build on Australia's proud history of resettling refugees and those in humanitarian need.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also moving amendments to schedule 2 and schedule 7 to the bill to address concerns raised in relation to the operation of the new safe haven enterprise visa, known as the SHEV, and temporary protection visas, known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPV" rel="nofollow">
         TPV
        </a>
        s. The first amendment I have moved to schedule 2 is to make clear on the face of legislation that holders of the SHEV will, in certain circumstances, be able to apply for certain types of permanent visas. It was always the government's intention to permit SHEV holders who work or study in regional Australia for at least 3½ years of their visa, and access income support for not more than 18 months in that time, to apply for onshore substantive visas, including permanent visas but not permanent protection visas, provided that they meet the application criteria for those visas.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, to alleviate concerns about the detail of the operation of the SHEV, it is proposed to clarify that the bar on visa applications by illegal maritime arrivals while lawful noncitizens will not apply to SHEV holders who have met the SHEV work and study requirements and who are applying for a prescribed list of visas. The pathways being proposed will include skilled and family visas and the full list of permanent visas for which SHEV holders may be eligible to apply for will be prescribed in the regulations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second amendment I am moving to schedule 2 is to set out the criteria for the grant of the SHEV. Schedule 2 to the bill already creates the SHEV as a new class of visa. This amendment will make it clear to the parliament what the criteria are for the grant of a SHEV and address the scare campaign suggesting that the government does not intend to follow through on the creation of this visa.
       </p>

        The third amendment I am moving to schedule 2 will allow travel in compassionate and compelling circumstances, as determined by the minister, to places other than a country in respect of which a TPV holder or a SHEV holder was found to be eligible for protection. If a TPV holder or a SHEV holder can demonstrate a compelling or compassionate need to travel, they will be able to request permission to do so from the minister. The permission would need to be sought prior to travel and cannot be to the country from which they sought protection.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments I am moving to schedule 7 are in relation to the minister's ability to cap the number of protection visas available in the financial year, which the bill clarifies in this schedule. Capping protection visas is in no way an attempt to resile from Australia's non-refoulement obligations. The amendments I am proposing would ensure that this is the case by preventing the minister from placing a statutory limit or cap on the number of temporary protection visas or safe haven enterprise visas granted in a program year. As a result of these amendments, it will not be possible to use this power to cut the number of temporary protection visas or safe haven enterprise visas available. These amendments will not impact on the power of the minister to place a cap on permanent protection visas. This power, which is clarified in schedule 7 to the bill, is intended to support the government's policy objective by granting only temporary protection to illegal maritime arrivals and encouraging the grant of SHEVs to the benefit of regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also moving amendments to schedule 4 aimed at increasing the integrity, transparency and accountability of the fast-track process. The first amendment I am proposing to schedule 4 is to clarify on the face of the legislation which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMA" rel="nofollow">
         IMA
        </a>
        s are subject to the fast track. The amendments will expand the definition to clarify that fast-track applicants will include persons who are an unauthorised maritime arrival and who entered Australia on or after 13 August 2012 but before 1 January 2014 and have not been taken to a regional processing country. This demonstrates the government's commitment to process IMAs currently on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        through the fast-track assessment process along with the current backlog of IMAs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, the proposed amendments to schedule 4 would amend the purpose of the Immigration Assessment Authority, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAA" rel="nofollow">
         IAA
        </a>
        , from being required to 'pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of limited review that is efficient and quick' to being required to 'pursue the objective of providing a mechanism which is efficient, quick, free from bias and consistent with the code of procedure'. This amendment would clarify the purpose of the IAA and reassure the public that the review by the IAA will be free of bias and consistent with division 3, the conduct of review, as well as efficient and quick.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third amendment I am proposing to schedule 4 would clarify certain circumstances which may satisfy the IAA that exc

          I would like to speak to these amendments moved by the government. I obviously have an awful lot of questions for the minister as well in relation to how on earth the government thinks it is appropriate to hold children as hostages in order to change fundamental pieces of legislation to simply grant the minister more power for himself. I have had many debates in this place over asylum seeker and refugee policy and many of them have been pretty undignified, but I must say I have never seen anything so appalling and abusive as I have seen in this place tonight. We heard from Senator Muir, who said he felt he was in such a difficult position—with a choice to vote for a bad bill or a terrible bill, because he was told that, if he did not do what the government wanted, the children would get it. He was told the only way to get these children out of detention was to pass this bill and this package. I have been saying for a number of weeks that the minister was using children in detention as hostages—it was a figure of speech until tonight. Tonight we saw children on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Christmas Island
          </a>
          being handed the phone number of Senator Muir, and they were asked to call that number and beg that senator to let them out. If that is not treating children as hostages, what is it?
         </p>
         <p>
          This minister has become one of the most sociopathic people in this country. I want to give you the definition of a sociopath. It is characterised by a lack of regard for the moral or legal standards of society, a master deceiver and manipulator, someone who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants with no regard for consequences. Minister Morrison is a sociopath who has held children as hostages in order to grab the power he wants in this place tonight.
         </p>
         <p>
          I do not blame Senator Muir. I do not blame any of the members on this crossbench. I do not even blame a number of the backbenchers of the Liberal-National party who I know are appalled at where this government's policy is doing but I sure as hell blame Minister Morrison and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
           Tony Abbott
          </a>
          . They have been desperate for months to get a win on this issue. They have done everything they could to make it a hard moral choice for people in this place. What is in this bill is not just temporary protection visas, not just a new visa created to allow people to work. We know there are seven schedules in this piece of legislation and the majority of them do exactly the opposite of helping children and their families resettle properly in this country.
         </p>
         <p>
          Minister Morrison has held children in detention for months, children he could have been released at any time. The conditions inside the detention centre on Christmas Island are appalling. Children have been abused. They have been raped and their parents have been raped. I am not exaggerating. This is what the evidence has shown. Why did he not get the children out when they started to be abused? Why did he not let the children out when they called, wrote and begged him to let them go to school six months ago? Why did he not let them out when the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Human Rights Commission
          </a>
          said they are the most disgraceful conditions children should ever be held in? Why did he not let them out then? Because he was waiting for his prime time to use them as bargaining chips, as pawns in his political play, to get legislation that he wanted through this place which previously had no support in this chamber.
         </p>
         <p>
          The amendments moved today by the minister do not improve the substance of this bill. The amendments put forward in this piece of legislation do not make any real difference to the use of those SHEVs or those
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPV" rel="nofollow">
           TPV
          </a>
          s, despite what the crossbench has been told. There is no way that somebody can honestly believe that there is a pathway to permanency for any of the people in this 30,000 caseload backlog. I want to address the backlog issue because one of the men responsible is the very same man who has now drafted and negotiated this dirty, hostage situation this week and his name is Paris Aristotle.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have a backlog of 30,000 asylum seekers in this country because Paris Aristotle told Prime Minister Gillard that it would be a good idea to freeze the applications of asylum seekers when they arrive here. He told Prime Minister Gillard at the time that that is how you stop the boats—stop processing people's claims, introduce something called the 'no advantage rule', which would mean that people would not have their claims processed for five or six years—they would not even put a figure on it. The boats did not stop; they kept coming, despite the fact that right in this place we had a debate about that exact piece of legislation which allowed for all of the recommendations that Paris Aristotle and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Houston" rel="nofollow">
           Angus Houston
          </a>
          wanted. We had a late night debate, very similar to what is going on here. I was standing right there. That legislation went through, the freeze occurred, the boats did not stop but boy oh boy, the backlog built up.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now in 2014, two years later, the very same person who created the policy which created this problem is in our crossbenchers' offices this week telling them, 'You have to do something to get these children off Christmas Island. You have to do something to change the laws so that the minister can fast track their applications and please, at least give them temporary protection visas.' They have no hope of putting down roots to rebuild their families in the country in which they deserve to get permanent protection. The very same person set the 30,000 asylum seekers and refugees up to fail from day one. It is appalling.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to put on the record today that I was appalled by Senator Xenophon's speech yesterday—the praise for Paris Aristotle, who does not represent the refugee sector in this country, has no authority in this country, is a ministerial adviser. He has negotiated a hostage situation hand in hand with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
           Scott Morrison
          </a>
          tonight.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          I want those kids off Christmas Island. I want the kids off Nauru. I want the people out of detention on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Manus Island
          </a>
          . But I do not believe in setting 30,000 people up to fail, giving them false hope that they will get their refugee claims assessed fairly—which they will not, because schedules 4 and 5 scrap their ability to ever have their claims assessed fairly—and pretending that somehow there is a pathway to permanency when the minister has said himself that it is going to be a 'very high bar to get there and good luck to them.' These people are being sold false hope, and who did the final deal but a distraught, broken, abused child on Christmas Island, down the telephone to a compassionate senator who wanted to do the right thing. This minister has not just used children as a bargaining chip. He has sold them a false dream once more.
         </p>
         <p>
          We know that when you strip away the ability to have a genuine appeal process, to have cases reviewed, you risk 60 per cent of applications being marked as wrong. Sixty per cent of the children on Christmas Island tonight who will come to Australia will never be given a visa under this legislation. It does not matter how compromising or willing we are to try to move on and give people some form of temporary visa or a SHEV. The reality is, the statistics tell us and past history and evidence show us that if this assessment process is changed the way the minister wants it changed, 60 per cent of those children are never even going to be given a temporary protection visa. This minister is not just a sociopath, not just grabber of power for himself who is prepared to take everything and use children to get it; he has sold senators in this place who are trying to do the right thing a lie. Sociopaths are masters and deceivers and manipulators. That is what we have seen here tonight, colleagues. That is exactly what we have seen here tonight.
         </p>
         <p>
          I heard Mr Palmer earlier today saying that he had won family reunion as part of this deal. I have looked through the legislation, I have looked through the amendments. There ain't no family reunion in here. We heard that people would be able to have a pathway to permanency. Well it is not in there, and it will not be in there for the majority of people we apparently must do this for to get them off the island. Why didn't the minister act to get those children out of detention when he was told that the conditions were damaging them—months ago? Why has he spent months attacking
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Triggs" rel="nofollow">
           Gillian Triggs
          </a>
          for standing up and saying these kids needed to be off the island and out of detention? Why didn't he act then? Because he was desperate to keep his chips in his pocket for exactly this occasion. Who would have been on the end of that phone call, distressed and crying, if he had already taken all the children out? I am appalled. Many people in this country tonight would be appalled. Using children as hostages is never okay, and only a sociopath would do it.

            The minister has stated publicly on the record that Australia's humanitarian intake will be increased from its current level of 13,750 places to 18,750 places. He has also stated that this will be done through two successive increases of 2,500 places in each of the 2017-18 and 2018-19 programs. The government will also maintain the size of the program over the next two years at no less than 13,750 places each year. I would also point out, Senator Carr, that one of the fundamental differences between what is occurring under this government and what occurred under the former government is that the places that are within the humanitarian program are going to go to genuine refugees from camps. They are not going to be places that go to people who have arrived illegally by boat. The minister has clearly stated that on the public record.

               Minister, the difficulty here is that there is a profound lack of trust and therefore we will be moving an amendment to give effect to the commitment that you have made in the chamber. Could I indicate to the chamber that, with regard to the provisions that the minister has outlined, the opposition will reluctantly support the government amendments on sheet
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HA" rel="nofollow">
                HA
               </a>
               108; however, we recognise that the amendments are incredibly weak but better than nothing. They will be improved when we are able to move an additional amendment specifying the precise numbers and, if the minister wishes to provide assistance, we would be delighted, to make sure we get exactly the right numbers that are consistent with what she has given a commitment to tonight.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have to acknowledge though that this is a humiliating admission by the immigration minister. It is of great concern that he cannot be trusted to honour any commitment to the crossbenchers on the issue of visa protection and has had to provide these public assurances. I am sure we will all feel a lot better if they are written into the act itself. I suppose we should not be surprised about that, given the long litany of broken promises that this government is able to display. The immigration minister has repeatedly demonstrated that he is willing to exercise his powers—I say he is willing to exercise his powers in a quite capricious manner—and he regularly needs to be called to account by the courts. While these amendments will not provide us with enormous satisfaction, they at least will do something to ensure that the minister is held to his commitments.
              </p>
              <p>
               We cannot support the government amendments on sheet

                GH
               </a>
               118, in essence, because the fast-track arrangements that the government has proposed do not provide sufficient security for proper administrative practice.
              </p>
              <p>
               We will be opposing the amendments on sheet HA110 simply because the Labor Party is concerned that the SHEV proposal fails to provide adequate security of a pathway to permanency, and, while people are judged to be genuine refugees, we think they are entitled to that. There is a very clear policy that this opposition Labor Party opposes temporary protection visas because they leave people in an unfair state of limbo. They are unable to put down roots and establish themselves in this country and they are unable to become fully functioning contributors to Australian society while they are left in that period of limbo. Our policy is that asylum seekers ought to have a pathway to permanency. The view of the opposition is that the government's proposals fail to meet that test, so we will be opposing those amendments.

                On Senator Carr's question with respect to the first amendments that I moved in relation to adding a new schedule 2A to the bill to progressively increase Australia's humanitarian program, I advise Senator Carr that this will be done by way of legislative instrument if the bill passes the Senate—or when the bill passes Senate—and this amendment enables the minister to sign off on the legislative instrument.

                   In addressing Senator Hanson-Young's question, the first thing that I would like to remind the Senate of is that it is actually this government that has commenced the process of taking children out of detention.
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
                    If I
                   </a>
                   could remind the Senate that at the end of the Howard government's era there were actually no children in detention. Under the former Rudd, Gillard and Rudd governments, vocally supported by Senator Hanson-Young, a total of 8,469 children arrived. There were a record number of children in detention, and in fact in July 2013 there were 1,992. When Labor lost office in September 2013, there were 1,392 children in detention. As a result of the actions of this government in but 14 months, there are now 50 per cent fewer children in detention across the detention network and 75 per cent fewer children in detention on
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   than when the coalition took office in September 2013.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So when Senator Hanson-Young comes into the chamber and claims the moral high ground in relation to children in detention, I would argue that the facts established under this government in relation to the reduction of the number of children in detention clearly show that one of the huge issues with Senator Hanson-Young is that, by her comments that she has placed on the record and her actions, she is responsible for preventing children from being released from detention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Nothing that Senator Hanson-Young has done in this place has contributed to one child being released from detention but everything that Senator Hanson-Young has done has ensured that children in record numbers—let me just read again the number of children who came here under the former government: 8,469 children arrived under the former government. Everything that Senator Hanson-Young has done for the duration of her time as a senator and her record will show that, unlike my record as a member of the coalition, she is responsible for ensuring that children are placed in detention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The minister and I, over the period of being in government, have ensured that children are progressively released from detention. As the minister has stated, if the bill passes the Senate, children on Christmas Island will be released prior to Christmas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I also need to address the comments that Senator Hanson-Young has made in relation to Mr Paris Aristotle. It is widely accepted throughout the community—and, in particular, by those people with whom he works—that Mr Aristotle is a man with a good heart and who, throughout his career, has worked tirelessly with victims of torture.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                   </a>
                   : Senator Hanson-Young, it demeans you when you come into the Senate under parliamentary privilege and make such heinous slurs in relation to Mr Aristotle, purely because he has been able to work with the government and the crossbenchers to achieve what you personally in six years have been unable to achieve and what you going forward for the rest of your time in this place will be unable to achieve—that is, the release of children from detention.

                     I would just like the minister to clarify the costs of the increased resettlement numbers. Minister Morrison is on the record saying that increasing the humanitarian intake to 20,000 would cost $3 billion over the forward estimates. That is the previous position of the minister, and the argument he has put as to why he could not entertain increasing the humanitarian intake is that it is going to cost $3 billion. I would like to know from Minister Cash where the budget figures are on this and where the $3 billion is going to come from.

                      Senator Hanson-Young, I think you and I are just going to have to agree to disagree in relation to so much of what you are going to put to me tonight. When it comes to costs, I have to say you are not one who can stand up in this chamber with any form of credibility, given that the policies that you supported so vocally under the former government led to an almost $12 billion cost blow-out for the Australian taxpayer. Everything that this government has done in this portfolio since it came to power has been to (a) restore integrity to our borders, and (b) ensure that taxpayers' money is efficiently spent.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Senator Hanson-Young, what you just do not seem to be able to grasp is that our humanitarian program costs the Australian taxpayer money. That is why it needs to be managed appropriately and that is exactly what we are doing.

                        IRMAN: Even though all the government amendments were moved together, because there was a foreshadowed amendment to one of the groups of amendments, and there is an indication that there are different positions on them, I will be putting the amendments in the groups that they are in on the running sheet. So I will be putting four separate questions.

                          Senator Hanson-Young, you would be well aware that there is no family reunion. Again, if you want to stand up and make cute political points, you can, but the facts do not support what you are stating.

                           announce that family reunion had been granted and that that was one of the concessions that he was able to get out of the minister. Clearly that is not the case. I thank the minister for the clarification. It seems that, again, Clive Palmer has been sold a pup.

I will not put those amendments until you have had an opportunity to circulate your amendment. The first amendments I will put are government amendments (1) to (3) on sheet

The simple proposition here for senators to consider is that if the government is happy to promise this increase in numbers of the annual refugee intake to 18,750 and to do so in front of

To resolve this matter I would seek the support of the Senate so that we do not have a situation whereby the government says, 'No cuts to the ABC, no cuts to

Does what you are asking mean that every time a public commitment is made it has to be legislated? I would put it to you that that is completely unrealistic. The minister has given a clear commitment publicly. He has given the commitment to the crossbenchers. I have recommitted the government and reiterated the commitment in my address tonight, which is recorded in

                                   I support this in principle. I have received an undertaking, as have other crossbench colleagues who support this measure. I would like to get a time frame as to when the legislative instrument will be introduced. I think it is reasonable to know that. If the legislative instrument is not introduced, I think the government knows that it will be a massive breach of faith and that the government cannot expect any cooperation from me on any future piece of legislation if the undertaking is broken. I think that is fairly clear.

I just want to point out that we are ending a year in which, during the last 12 months, we have seen broken promise after broken promise within 12 months of an election. The commitment that has been given to crossbenchers in this place is that the—

I am more than happy to have a debate with Senator Bernardi any time, but perhaps he would have the courtesy to allow people to finish speaking. The point I am making here is that, if the government honestly want to show that they are committed to increasing the humanitarian intake and expect both the public and the Senate to believe that that will be honoured after the next election, put your money where your mouth is and make sure it is in the legislation tonight. I cannot see why that would be such a problem from a government who desperately want the public and the parliament to believe them.

                                        () (): While I have substantial sympathy for this amendment, I will not be supporting it. I discovered after the event that Minister Morrison has agreed to an increase in the humanitarian intake as a result of my representations, plus those of Senators Day and Xenophon. I also understand that the cost of humanitarian refugees is quite considerable, and to increase the number in this manner would be a very big burden on the budget. As senators will know, that is something of major concern to me. However, I am also pleased that the minister has agreed to allow those on bridging visas and, of course,

I am fairly new here, but I can guarantee the minister in this place that, if I make a commitment to do something, I will do it—and I expect the minister to reciprocate. His commitment to increase the humanitarian intake is a worthy commitment, but I do not think that enshrining it in legislation is the way to go. I do take the minister at his—

                                            I draw the attention of those who have just spoken to what the words in the current bill actually say. It says the minister 'may' by legislative instrument determine a minimum total number of protection class visas and refugee and humanitarian class visas. There is a real issue here. You believe you have been given an assurance. The

                                            senators were given an assurance some months ago which they believe was reneged upon. That is why there has been this considerable delay in having this matter put before the chamber. I urge you to think carefully about assurances you have been given. Therefore, you have this opportunity here to have the assurance you have stated actually put into the legislation.

This schedule effectively allows, at the command of the immigration minister, our Navy and our customs officers to be directed to act illegally on the high seas. We know of course that there have been terrible situations where our Navy officers have been asked to do things that no person working for the Australian government and in the name of the Australian people should be asked to do. We know that because we saw it. We saw officers only this week pour their hearts out on the

                                                    I indicate that the opposition will be supporting the Greens on this. We oppose schedule 1 on the grounds that this represents a very clear attempt by this government to undermine the High Court. It is a very shoddy exercise here. The government is attempting to undermine a case that is currently before the High Court. A little while back this government took into custody 157 people and detained them on a prison ship for over a month. When that matter was brought to the attention of the courts this government protested vigorously and sought to undertake these measures to undermine the court proceedings.

                                                    This schedule, if carried, would scuttle the High Court case. It would render the precedent value of the present proceedings redundant. That is a case which is fundamentally about the powers of the government under the Maritime Powers Act.

                                                    has a legitimate function to perform in assessing the government's actions. This is not about this chamber making a pre-emptive decision on that matter; it is about whether or not the High Court is an appropriate place to evaluate the government's actions.

                                                    It is simply inappropriate to walk down this path when the case is currently before the court. After the court has made its decision, then the government I believe would be entitled to put a proposition to the parliament, but I put to this chamber that to do so while the proceedings are under way is totally inappropriate. We strongly believe that this is not an appropriate use of this chamber. We ought to ensure that the proceedings before the court run their course. The High Court should be allowed to continue the work it has been able to do and that is why we are opposing this schedule.

                                                     I advise that the government will not be supporting Senator Hanson-Young's proposal. Schedule 1 of the bill clarifies a range of matters relating to the exercise of maritime powers. Maritime powers are used to respond to a range of threats to Australia's national interests, including the smuggling of contraband goods, protecting Australia's fisheries, protecting our ocean and coastal ecosystems from environmental damage, and countering people smuggling. The amendments to the Maritime Powers Act are focused on strengthening Australia's maritime enforcement framework and will provide greater clarity to the ongoing conduct of border security and maritime enforcement operations. These amendments do not seek to create new powers beyond what is already available to maritime officers; instead they clarify the intended operation of those powers and their relationship with the law.

                                                     can also address the comments that Senator Carr has made in relation to the matter that is currently before the court, there is nothing unusual about amendments to legislation wholly or partly in response to issues raised in a court case. Court cases can help to reveal when a piece of legislation is not being interpreted in a manner consistent with parliament's original intention, allowing parliament to address and rectify this through amendments. The proposed amendments do not affect the case before the High Court or undermine the ability of the court to consider and pass judgement on the applicable law, neither do they prevent the members from considering the court's judgement in time. The government is conscious that any potential adverse decision by the High Court will see people smugglers send the message that Australia is open for business. Introducing these amendments now will also limit the ability of people smugglers to trick vulnerable people into believing this message.

This is the part of the bill that includes legislating for temporary protection visas and allowing for regulations for SHEVs. The reason, fundamentally, the Greens do not support this schedule is because people who have been found to be legitimate, genuine refugees after all of the anguish they have been through—fleeing their homelands and going through the detention process—under this schedule will continue to live in limbo, effectively for the rest of their lives. Many of the 30,000 we are currently talking about are already having to live in the community in limbo. There is absolutely no genuine pathway to permanency outlined in this schedule at all. It is a long road—

                                                       As I was saying, this schedule, as it currently stands, does not create a permanent pathway for refugees. People who have been through the process and have been assessed as a refugee under the current schedule do not have a pathway to permanency. If you are on a temporary protection visa, you will never be given a permanent visa. That is what the minister has said, and that is what this piece of legislation currently before us tonight does. You may be able to opt to go on to the newly created SHEV under this schedule, but it is going to be damn hard for you to ever be able to apply for a permanent visa.
                                                      </p>

                                                       That is not just me saying that, it is the minister himself. The immigration minister himself stood up and said: 'There will be no permanent protection for refugees in this country. Good luck to them if they think they're going to get permanency, but it is a very high bar.' They are the minister's own words, that is the sentiment as outlined in this schedule. It is a pipe dream to think that there is any pathway to permanency under this schedule. It allows for the continued torture of people who just want to start putting their lives back together. You have to remember that this is for people who have already been assessed to be refugees. They have been in detention for years, many of them in the community on bridging visas for years—in limbo, not knowing what their future holds. Under this schedule they will stay there effectively forever. There is no pathway to permanency; it is a pathway to nowhere. That is why it needs to be removed.

                                                        Labor is resolutely opposed to the use of temporary protection visas as a quick fix to deal with men and women and children who are currently awaiting processing in Australian funded facilities. Temporary protection visas simply place people in a prolonged state of limbo. They serve as a stopgap that keep people in a cycle of uncertainty. They prevent them from contributing to the community and forging proper links in Australia.

                                                        When the parliament, and particularly this chamber, rejected the immigration minister's policy of bringing back temporary protection visas in December last year, the minister, in an act of petulance, stopped processing people—yes, that is right, Minister; I see you are in the chamber. You are clearly here because you cannot trust your senators to do the government's dirty work! We all understand the protocols here, and that is essentially why you are here. I see you nodding vigorously there, but the fact remains that you acted in a completely petulant manner because this chamber chose to reject the policy position that you adopted.

Australia has in fact been taken off the table with the regional settlement arrangements, which were introduced by Labor in July last year. This issue has absolutely nothing to do with any person who may seek to come here by boat. It relates to people already in detention who arrived before 19 July last year. For that group of people, Labor believe we need to have a sensible policy that sees them processed and, if they are found to be genuine refugees, allowed to settle in Australia.

This is where the government, the Greens and the opposition truly do part company. This is where the difference between how you manage your borders and whether you manage them with integrity or whether you let the people smugglers take control of Australia's borders becomes apparent. We have often stated this on this side of the chamber. In fact, we have said it since that fateful day in August 2008, when the then minister for immigration, Senator Chris Evans, commenced the wind back of the former Howard government's strong border protection policies, which had done what this government, under Minister Morrison, has done—that is, stopped the boats. We had always said that we would bring temporary protection visas back as part of our suite of policies—and why. The question we need to ask ourselves tonight is: why? The reason is evidenced in the facts. If you put the sugar on the table and you give the people-smugglers a problem to promote, they will. That product is a permanent visa in Australia. You take the sugar off the table, you take the product, the promise—

You take permanent protection off the table, and the vile people-smugglers, who deal in human misery, no longer have a product to sell. That is exactly what this schedule does. Tonight we bring an end to 50,000 people coming here illegally by boat because the people-smugglers had a product to sell. Tonight we will put an end to the deaths at sea that occurred because the people-smugglers were able to market permanent protection in Australia. We know that in excess of 1,200 people were promised permanent visas in Australia and that they risked their lives to get here, and they did not get here—they died making the voyage. Tonight we put an end to that. We also put an end to the in excess of $11½ billion in cost blow-outs that the former government, so vocally supported by Senator Hanson-Young, oversaw because they failed to understand that permanent protection visas are the one thing that people-smugglers use to market their vile trade.

There's so many people on the water and they all look the same. All you see is a head and a face. That was one of the most difficult aspects of the recovery of the people in the water that are alive was the fact that you're playing God. And, I didn't like that too often—too much.

                                                          is clearly not delivering any type of permanent protection to the 30,000 asylum seekers and refugees that are here. This is why this schedule should be deleted, because it does not deliver anything of the sort in terms of a pathway to permanency. That is clear. The minister has tonight made that crystal clear—the government has no intention of giving anybody a permanent visa. Of course, things like family reunion, as we have heard already tonight, are not included in this piece of legislation. All we see is a bill riddled with a grab for power by the immigration minister in order to pick and choose who he wants to come to this country and who he does not—not based on the refugee convention, not based on what Australia's obligations are and not based on need but based on who Mr Morrison, the immigration minister, wants to allow into this country and who he does not. How has he done this? He has done this by manipulating the good will, the compassion and the desire in this place of people to give hope and decency to asylum seekers and refugees.

                                                          We have had the minister use children as bargaining chips to deliver a deal that the minister here tonight has just confirmed does not give any permanent visa. It does not deliver one permanent visa. It does not deliver family reunion. We have seen children used as a bargaining chip—that is the way it rolls with this minister. I wonder if that is the type of leadership that the Liberal Party want to see leading their party.

                                                          We know that Minister Morrison desperately wants to become the next prime minister of this country, a man who has used children as a bargaining chip as part of his blackmail politics and, we have heard tonight, to deliver a deal—the Mr Palmer, Senator Xenophon, Minister Morrison deal—which does not even stack up to the things they have been promised.

                                                          This amendment deals with schedule 3 of the bill. Schedule 3 gives incredible power to the immigration minister to effectively hold this chamber over a barrel when it comes to the regulations in relation to a number of visas—not just temporary protection visas, not just the SHEVs. It covers a raft of visas, including the permanent protection visas to which, as we have heard from Minister Cash tonight, the government is so vehemently opposed. They so hate the idea of giving genuine refugees permanent protection—or any type of permanent visa.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          Schedule 3 effectively allows for the minister to dictate to this place that it is his way or the highway. If a regulation for a visa is made and if we senators do not agree with that regulation, for whatever reason, if we were to disallow any of those regulations it makes any current application for any one of those visas invalid. What an incredible amount of power to hand to a minister who we know cannot be trusted to do the right thing when it comes to treating people fairly, who cannot be trusted to look after children in his care.

That is what we have seen happen here tonight. That is what we have seen happen over the last few weeks.

They hate hearing that the person who is going to lead their party uses children as bargaining chips. They cannot stand the idea that the next leader of the Liberal government is going to be a man who is so drunk with power, so obsessed with his own authority that is prepared hold children as hostages just to get his own way. This schedule hands ultimate power to this minister and it is why it needs to be deleted.

We know what this government does with legislation. We saw the crossbench having to fix it only a few weeks ago when it came to the FoFA laws. We know they cannot be trusted when it comes to legislation, and here we have the minister saying, 'You know we can't be trusted, so we're going to take away the total ability for you to fix it in the future.'

                                                               If somebody has been found to be a genuine refugee—they have had their assessments, they have had their case looked at and they are given refugee status—and is then put onto a SHEV, a safe haven enterprise visa, and they fulfil the requirements set out in that visa, working for 3½ years in a rural area or studying and not draining welfare, then after the five years why do they not get a permanent visa? If the SHEV is designed as a pathway to permanency once you have proven not just that you are refugee but that you have the good character to be able to rebuild your life and contribute to this country then after you have met the requirements of the SHEV you should be given a permanent visa. Why continue to play a game with people's lives and require them to get a different type of visa, go on to another temporary visa, never really finding that pathway to permanency?

That is currently not in the legislation. It was not in the government's amendments as negotiated between Mr Palmer, Senator Xenophon and Minister Morrison. That deal did not include a pathway to permanency. If we accept that that is important, if people prove that they are worthy of being able to stay in this country, let's give them permanency at the end of that SHEV process. That is what these amendments seek to do.

This demonstrates, on the historic record, that overwhelming numbers of people on TPVs deserved to have permanency. These sets of amendments put our long- and well-held view of the failure of this TPV regime, and I would urge the Senate to support them.

Under the John Howard government, temporary protection visas encouraged women and children onto boats. Temporary protection visas kept genuine refugees in limbo in the community for years, suffering unnecessarily. They do not allow people who are genuine refugees who need protection, who deserve protection and who want to contribute to our nation the ability to rebuild their lives or to have certainty around what their kids are going to do and what jobs they are going to take. Temporary protection visas were a fundamental failure of policy last time they existed, and they will be again. That is why the Greens support deleting them from the bill.

This is the schedule that fundamentally changes the way people will have their refugee assessment made. The minister has argued that it creates a rapid process for asylum seekers who will be assessed under this caseload of 30,000. In reality, what this will do is strip away people's ability to appeal decisions and to ensure that the correct information about their cases is what is being used to make their assessments. It strips their ability to have their cases reviewed by the Refugee Review Tribunal. These amendments are all about the government trying to make it as hard as possible for somebody to be found to be a genuine refugee.
                                                                       </p>

                                                                        This schedule was the most fundamental concern of refugee advocates and lawyers who submitted to the Senate's inquiry into this piece of legislation. It is stripping away people's ability to ensure that they get a fair hearing, that after all these years of being locked in detention and then dumped in the community with nothing, people are being asked to be fast-tracked, shunted through a system where they do not have appeal rights, where they do not have the ability to make sure that the information they put forward is correct, and the minister himself is allowed to have such ultimate power that he can put big crosses next to these people's names and no-one is going to be able to have that reviewed or to know that those crosses that the minister has put next to their refugee assessment will be reviewed.
                                                                       </p>

                                                                        It is important to note that those who are found under this process to not be owed protection will become unlawful citizens—no right of appeal, no ability to check that the minister has made the right assessment. And they become unlawful citizens. And what happens then? Those people will go back into immigration detention, awaiting deportation. This whole argument that this is about getting people out of detention is actually a furphy, and this schedule exposes that. We know that over 60 per cent of cases are overturned because the first decision made was the wrong one. That means that over 60 per cent of the 30,000 people are going to not be found to be owed protection if this schedule passes. That does not mean that they are not refugees; it just means that the minister does not have to admit that a mistake was made. It makes it easier for him to stick them back into detention or on a plane back to Kabul, or to Quetta, or to whatever other place from which they have fled persecution.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        The reason this is so fundamental is that it is about life and death. This is about how you assess somebody to be a refugee. We have spent most of the night in this place debating what happens once somebody is found to be a refugee—whether they get a temporary visa, whether it is a pathway to permanency—when in actual fact this is the crux of it: the minister wants the power to give fewer visas to people, full stop. He wants to be able to put more people on a plane and deport them back to danger. The schedule is fundamentally flawed. It is abhorrent to the rule of law, and it must not proceed.

Schedule 4 as it is currently presented—and if the Senate agrees—would have the effect of removing access to the Refugee Review Tribunal for certain asylum seekers to whom the government has given fast-track applications—a somewhat Orwellian concept. Now, in lieu of the Refugee Review Tribunal, the government is proposing that asylum seekers who have had their application for protection denied will be directed to a new body called the Immigration Assessment Authority. And one of the fundamental principles of administrative arrangements in this country is the access that people have to review of decisions that are taken by officers, providing—I think appropriately—a provision for natural justice and the opportunity to have decisions actually reviewed. And because of the very high percentage of cases that are actually overturned by the review mechanism, it is quite clear that such a body is necessary.
                                                                        </p>

It will be on the papers; it will not necessarily be through any proper judicial standard of review. Unsuccessful asylum claimants will not have an opportunity to appear before such a body to actually argue their case. The review will be conducted by bureaucrats in a closed office. Asylum seekers will not have the opportunity to even make written submissions. Asylum seekers will not have the opportunity to be notified of adverse findings about them or respond to those findings. They will be denied the right of legal representation.
                                                                        </p>

In any proper judicial process in this country you would have an expectation of legal representation. You would have an expectation that you would be told about the proceedings. You would have an expectation that you would actually be able to present your case. But under this measure none of those basic provisions or legal protections in this country are allowed. There are no prescribed grounds for a review to be conducted by such a body. It is a process that is entirely at the discretion of the reviewer. This strikes me as being fundamentally at odds with the judicial principles that we would have expected in this country.
                                                                        </p>

But you do not have the minister ring up and put the fix in, and that is what these proposals would allow. You must have a legal process that stands up to scrutiny. And the

What this measure suggests to me is a somewhat pale imitation of current practices with the Refugee Review Tribunal and falls dramatically short of the basic principles of fairness. I ask this chamber to consider the implications of endorsing such a process for people who have a genuine need to have their decisions reviewed by a proper, fair process. Simply put, if this proposition is upheld, asylum seekers will not be afforded natural justice. The basic principles of reasonable administrative decision making that we have all come to expect will be abandoned.
                                                                        </p>

That is to be scrapped and replaced with a team of bureaucrats, sitting in closed offices, subject to the direction of government and lacking the institutional independence of the Refugee Review Tribunal. That would mean that the government would take control of the review processes, when administrative decisions—as we all know, because of the representations we all have to take—have so often been demonstrated to be incorrect. The proposition that you have been asked to endorse is a 'trust me, trust the government' approach to justice. That is fundamentally contrary to the principles of the way in which our legal system is operated in this country. Rights and obligations of asylum seekers should not be at the mercy of executive government. Asylum seekers are entitled to a fair and independent, a transparent and credible, forum to have their claims assessed properly. That is why Labor senators will be opposing schedule 4 of this bill.

This amendment is in relation to deleting schedule 5, which is the schedule that removes the refugee convention from the Migration Act, effectively allowing the minister of the day, the government, to determine what a refugee is, the definition of a refugee, and how international law will be applied in this country. It is an abusive use of power by this minister. It would be a fundamental change to the way Australia deals with our obligations under international law and would send a significant message to the international community that Australia does not care about the refugee convention. This schedule cannot stand the way it is. It is wrong to delete the refugee convention from Australia's law books. It does not matter how much you want to spin it. Why does it need to be done? Because Minister Morrison does not want to have to abide by the obligations as outlined by the refugee convention. If he did, it would not matter. We asked the department, during the inquiry into this, when has this ever occurred before, where you put in the government of the day's own interpretation of our obligations under international law?
                                                                           </p>
                                                                           <p>
                                                                            They could not tell us, because it has not happened. Why hasn't it happened? Because it is wrong. When we abide by international law you put that in your legislation, you say we stick by the convention and you get on and stick by the rules you have signed up to. The schedule should be deleted.
                                                                           </p>

I again confirm for the chamber that, despite the statements made by Senator Hanson-Young, these amendments do not attempt to displace Australia's obligations under the refugees convention. The new statutory refugee framework is consistent with Australia's obligation under the refugees convention and in no way resiles from Australia' nonrefoulement obligations under the convention. Putting our international obligations into the relevant act will actually serve to strengthen them. We are a sovereign nation and this will ensure that our laws are determined by Australians and the Australian parliament.

These measures are being moved in the light of the changes the government is making. This is being moved because the replacement of the refugee convention with these preferred interpretations of convention obligations requires much closer definitions of the so-called modifications that people have to enter into if they are to attract support. As a consequence, I believe they are self-evident requirements, and I commend them to the chamber.

It is the schedule that effectively renders babies born in Australia stateless. It says that those babies who are born here in Australia to asylum seeker parents, whether they are born in a hospital in Perth, in Adelaide or in Brisbane, will be classified as unauthorised maritime arrivals. This schedule is designed to keep those babies in limbo, along with their families. And, of course, one of the most awful parts of this schedule is that it is retrospective. We know that over 100 babies have been born here in Australia. They were delivered like any other baby. They arrived in the way that any other children in this country have. They are not maritime arrivals, and yet this schedule renders them to be unauthorised maritime arrivals.
                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                   Furthermore, of those who have already been born, 24 of them, tomorrow when this bill passes, will be on a plane to Nauru. The minister has said that the moment this bill passes those 24 babies, who were born here in Australia, will be on a plane to Nauru. It is putting children back in detention. I see that the minister is here in the chamber tonight, and he is grinning. I find that appalling. Twenty-four babies born in Australia are going to be sent to Nauru under this schedule. It needs to be deleted.

We believe that reporting on the 90-day rule has been an important accountability measure to ensure that the government operates in a timely way in assessing protection applications. At the end of Labor's period in office, about half of all protection applications were decided within 90 days. However, the most recent report, on 1 March 2014 through to 30 June 2014, indicated that only 14 per cent of cases were determined within the 90-day period. Because this government has an obsession with secrecy, we are concerned to ensure that there are accountability mechanisms built into the legislation. So we will oppose any attempt to water down the 90-day rule.
