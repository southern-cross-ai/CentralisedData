        Dear Senator Polley
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am writing to provide an interim response to the Committee’s report (Transparency and Accountability of Commonwealth Public Funding and Expenditure, March 2007).

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        made a number of recommendations that are consistent with the reforms I have announced under the banner of Operation Sunlight and which the Government has already begun to implement. I have also announced, on 24 March 2008, that Senator Andrew Murray is to review and provide advice on options to further improve budget transparency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Murray has been asked to conduct his review and provide advice to me before 30 June 2008, The advice will take into account the initiatives covered under Operation Sunlight as well as the findings and recommendations of your Committee’s report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe it is important to receive Senator Murray’s advice prior to finalising a formal response to your Committee’s report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As an interim measure, however, I would like to advise you of efforts under the first phase of Operation Sunlight which the Government has either implemented or will be implementing in 2008 that are consistent with a number of the recommendations of your Committee’s report:

           as I advised you in my letter of 10 March 2008, agency Portfolio Budget Statements have been redesigned to include a resource statement, outlining all of the resources available to the agency, as well as a more consistent approach across agencies to the structure and presentation of their information, and

        is committed to increasing the standards of transparency under Operation Sunlight and I consider that the initiatives outlined above represent a practical and first step forward.
