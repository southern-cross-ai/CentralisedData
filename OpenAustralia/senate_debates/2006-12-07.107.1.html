         Mr President
        </a>
        , I draw your attention to the failure of ministers to answer questions on notice Nos 2523 to 2543. I refer first to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The question was in reference to meetings between the minister and representatives of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_Brethren" rel="nofollow">
         Exclusive Brethren
        </a>
        and asks:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Has the Minister met with representatives of the Exclusive Brethren in the past 5 years: if so, in each case: (a) when was the meeting; (b) where was the meeting held; (c) who attended the meeting; and (d) what matters were discussed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The question went to all ministers and ministers representing ministers in the Senate. I ask for an explanation, 65 days on, as to why those questions have not been answered by the Minister representing the Prime Minister and by the other ministers who were asked.

It is now history, only a week old, that the court order was to be lifted and the New Zealand leader of the National Party, the Leader of the Opposition there, resigned before that lifting occurred. What was found out, however, about the very serious intervention by the

That is, the colleagues of this Australian government across the Tasman were approached—

Every minister in this place knows the rules. When a question like that is put on notice, there are 30 days in which to answer. Every minister knows that my office has approached the government to ask why this question has not been answered. I can only assume that there is some form of collectivism going on over there—a defensive collectivism which involves not answering these questions.

                   , in the United States and elsewhere, this secretive sect—which refuses to allow its members to vote, which despises the democratic system—nevertheless has busied itself with pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into supporting the Hon. Prime Minister

                  <p>
                   We Greens say everybody has the right to take part in the democratic process. But let it be on the record. Let it not be covert. Let it not be hidden. Let it not be in back rooms, as happened in New Zealand. Let there not be secret meetings. Let it not be a case where material used to attack the Greens in Tasmania turns up in New Zealand with a slight word change and gloating by the Exclusive Brethren that this is an effective way to ‘fix’ the opponents of the National Party in New Zealand. Of course, what happened in New Zealand was that they were not only spotted; they were discovered. They were discovered because some members of the

                   National Party were so disgusted with what was going on there that they decided they wanted it on the public record. And it now is on the public record.

                  <p>
                   I ask: what is the relationship between the Prime Minister of this country and the Exclusive Brethren? He has admitted to meeting them, but he will not answer the questions about where, whom and when, and what deals were done. I think the Prime Minister owes it to this country and its democratic system to be honest in this matter. I think every minister in this place owes it to the country to be honest.

Why can’t the Prime Minister say what was discussed? We know what was discussed in

                     The questions about the last election in this country, about the extensive and hugely expensive advertising by the Exclusive Brethren on behalf of or in the interests of the Prime Minister and the government, have not been answered. It is one thing for the secretive Exclusive Brethren to cover up on that, but it is another thing for the Prime Minister and the ministers of this government to cover up on that. Why has not one minister of the government in this parliament been prepared to answer these very simple questions and has preferred to breach standing orders which say that those questions shall be answered within 30 days? What is the embarrassment that is being covered up here? What secretive dealings are being kept hidden on this side of the Tasman while we await emails to be leaked or some honest person to come out and say, ‘Here is the record.’ All we want is the record of the relationships between this sect and the government. Amongst other things it has given the Exclusive Brethren specific provisions under the

                           To the member opposite, you ask me questions—I am asking the questions here today, and they are ducking for cover. They cannot wait to get out of this place. But I want them to know that this matter is far from finished—for this reason: you cannot have a fair and honest democracy; you cannot be open and honest with the people of Australia if you hide either in the Prime Minister’s office or in any other minister’s office records of meeting with a non-voting sect which opposes military training, which has a derogatory attitude to women and which bans children from going to university, for goodness sake, and expect that nobody will be concerned about it. These are matters that the government says it stands for: democracy and a fair go for everybody.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The Prime Minister has railed against groups that discriminate against women, but not this group. Never has he mentioned the discrimination, for example, in the workplace where no woman in the

                           sect can hold a position senior to any male in that workplace. What sort of attitude is that in 2006 in this country? What other group would escape Prime Ministerial odium if they banned thousands of children from a right to a university education in this country? This Prime Minister is silent on the matter. Quid pro quo? That is for him to answer.

It should answer them before we close this evening. If not, every member of the Australian public has the right to believe that this government is covering up.
