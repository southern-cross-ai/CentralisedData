        I table the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the amendments. These amendments insert a new definition of Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Australia and Singapore are currently operating with different versions of the system—Australia on the 2017 version of the system and Singapore on the 2012 version. This new definition is required to expressly recognise the version of this system currently operating in Singapore. Without addressing this inconsistency, the amending agreement would not be able to enter into force. This new definition is drafted in a way that will allow for the update when Singapore moves to the 2017 version of the system, which will be sometime in 2018, and for any future versions that are adopted. That this inconsistency would prevent the amending agreement from entering into force was not apparent until work commenced on the required subordinate regulation. These government amendments, which allow for the recognition of the 2012 version of the system operating in Singapore, will allow the amending agreement to enter into force before the end of the year. The new definition of 'harmonised system' will be adopted across future frameworks implementing free trade agreements and in the Customs Act 1901 to ensure the systems setting out the tariff classification on which the agreements are negotiated are accurately reflected.
       </p>
       <p>
        A further government amendment to allow for the incorporation of the product-specific rules by reference to the text of the amending agreement is also proposed. This will streamline the required subordinate regulation and also allow for future revisions of the product-specific rules to be included without amending the regulation. Without these government amendments, the amending agreement will not be able to enter into force by the end of the year. This would prevent Australian businesses from receiving the many benefits that flow from the amending agreement.

         The opposition will support these amendments on the basis of the assurance that the government has given us that these are not policy changes but administrative changes. These amendments were circulated on Tuesday in this chamber. The process of passing these would have been facilitated if there had been direct contact with the opposition, but that has now been rectified and we'll accordingly support the proposition.
