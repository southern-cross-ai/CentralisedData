        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Kemp. Will the minister outline to the Senate the measures that the Howard government is introducing to improve the economic wellbeing of Australian families?

         I thank my colleague Senator Ronaldson for that very important question. Senator Ronaldson has always been very interested in family policies. This is a government that listens to families and does not take its orders from trade union bosses.

             Mr President
            </a>
            . Helping families, of course, is one of the highest priorities of this government. Senators will know that this yearâ€™s budget continues to deliver on the unprecedented levels of support that this government has provided to Australian families over the last 10 years. Our very responsible management of the Australian economy has enabled us to deliver practical benefits to Australian families. Senators will recall that Labor left the Howard government with $96 billion of debt. As a result of our paying back this debt, we are now saving in the order of $8 billion a year. This has enabled us to provide further benefits to Australian taxpayers and Australian families.
           </p>
           <p>
            This side of the chamber is committed to helping families find the balance between work and family responsibilities. Australian families will benefit from these budget measures, which come into effect between now and 1 July this year, building on the family friendly policies of budgets before. Since 1996, this government has doubled assistance to families through the family tax benefit system. The measures in this budget will provide additional assistance to Australian families at a cost of almost $1 billion over four years. The government will also expand the eligibility for the large family supplement to include families with three children. This payment of an extra $248 per year is very good news to nearly 350,000 Australian families.
           </p>
           <p>
            The coalition government continues to provide certainty and security for older Australians. In 2005, as senators should recall, the government introduced a utilities allowance for age pensioners and a seniors concession allowance for certain self-funded retirees who do not get pensioner concessions. This year the government will provide an additional one-off payment of just over $102 to each household with a person of age pension or service pension age eligible for that allowance. The same payment will also be provided to each self-funded retiree who is eligible for a seniors concession allowance. Senators will recall that further help was provided to carers and that has been widely welcomed in that community.
           </p>
           <p>
            It should be recalled that the Labor Party has fought tooth and nail against many of the very important measures that this government has brought in to help families. We recall the famous comment by the member for Lilley, who said that the $600 payment to families was not real. As you will recall, that became a significant election issue. Australian families will also remember the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
             ALP
            </a>
            policy to scrap the family tax benefit part B. That caused great consternation in the community. Even worse, if that is possible, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Labor Party
            </a>
            over the years has often opposed the tax cuts that this government has put before this chamber. This government has a very proud record of helping Australian families. That is because we listen to Australian families and we do not listen to union bosses who propose policies which can, of course, in the end often harm Australian families.
