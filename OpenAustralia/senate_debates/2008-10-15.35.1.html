        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Faulkner. Would the minister outline the government’s position on the question of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sahara
        </a>
        , specifically on the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination, given that back in 2002 as shadow foreign minister the Prime Minister stated that the people of Western Sahara must have a fair opportunity to determine their own future? Just to remind the minister, I will read from a press release from Mr Rudd dated 30 July 2002: ‘It is time the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        acted and gave the Saharawis a fair opportunity to determine their own future.’

         I am afraid that, beyond listening with interest to the comments that Mr Rudd made when he was shadow foreign minister, I am unable at this stage to update the Senate in relation to this matter because I have not been briefed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be able to do so. I do take the view on these things that any information I provide to the Senate needs to be accurate and it needs to be contemporary. I would hope that other senators would agree that that is the appropriate course of action. As a result of what I believe is an appropriate approach—

          I would be surprised if senators on the other side of this chamber who are

          would disagree with that—I certainly undertake to Senator Hanson-Young that I will provide that information. Obviously, I will need to receive the information from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I do give the senator an undertaking that I will seek that information from the minister for her at the earliest available opportunity. I will also indicate whether there has been any change since the earlier statements that the senator refers to were made.

              You know it is disorderly to interject, Senator Macdonald, and I am surprised that you of all people would breach the standing orders of the Senate! I indicate to Senator Hanson-Young that I will seek that advice from the minister. If there is information that can be made available in relation to any such government-to-government contact, I will certainly provide it to her.
