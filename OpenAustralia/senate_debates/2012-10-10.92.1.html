         I thank Senator Moore for her continued interest in this area. This week is World
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Mental Health
         </a>
         Week, which seeks to raise awareness of mental health and wellbeing in the wider community. It is about reducing the stigma and supporting those with mental illness and their carers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mental illness is the largest single cause of disability in Australia. One in five people and one in four young people will experience a mental health issue in any given year. It is saddening to know that many Australians with mental illness are not seeking or receiving treatment. Mental illness disproportionately affects young people, but only 25 per cent of the 16- to 24-year-olds who experience mental illness will get help. Individuals suffering a mental illness have a life expectancy 20 years lower than that of the general population in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Supporting a person suffering from mental illness can be difficult for families, friends and communities. That is why the Gillard government recognises mental illness as a national priority. For decades this area has been plagued by bad planning and underinvestment, and our government has undertaken to reform and improve Australia's mental health system and provide adequate health care for all Australians. The Gillard government is providing a $2.2 billion reform package over five years. Labor is delivering reforms over five years through better detection, better targeting and better coordination of mental health services. In the last budget, our mental health package included $571 million for better coordination services for people with severe and persistent mental illness and complex needs.

          It is a shame that those opposite do want to depart from the bipartisan support and do want to interject on what is a very serious issue in the community and treat it—

            I thank Senator Moore for her supplementary question. Rural people with a mental illness face extra challenges such as isolation and difficulty accessing services. We also know that rates of suicide and suicide attempts are higher in rural and remote areas of Australia than in urban areas. The Taking Action to Tackle Suicide package commenced in July 2011. It includes initiatives such as providing free calls from mobile phones to Lifeline. The government provides around $7.1 million each year from national suicide prevention programs for a range of projects in rural and remote areas. The government is also supporting online therapy.

            Connect went live in June this year and there is now online mental health support and therapy. Online therapy can be effective, particularly for people with mild to moderate anxiety and depression. This mode of delivery allows people to seek help from their own home—

              I thank Senator Moore for her second supplementary question. The Gillard government's mental health package recognises the diverse impact of mental illness through a person's lifetime. The government is committed to building services around the user and to stopping families from being shifted from one service to another. We do not want people falling between the cracks in this area. We have provided nearly $550 million over five years to better coordinate mental health services for something in the order of 24,000 people with severe and persistent mental illness and complex multiagency support needs. The government is investing a further $344 million. This will shift the onus away from where it currently is—on individuals with severe mental illness and their families, who have been responsible for traversing through the complex range of services. The government will fund local organisations and will provide a single point of contact.
