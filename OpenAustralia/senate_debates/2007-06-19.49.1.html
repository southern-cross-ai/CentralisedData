       <p class="italic">
        We have taken the opportunity to remove a redundant provision from Appropriation Bills Nos. 1 and 2 and the Parliamentary Departments Appropriation Bill No. 1. The Departmental Items Adjustments and other similar provisions will no longer be required in the annual appropriation Bills.

        The Bill includes a minor technical change to section 14 to streamline ministerial determinations that are made on payments to the states, territories and local government authorities.

        It is with great pleasure that I introduce Appropriation Bill (NO. 5) 2006-2007.

        There are two Supplementary Additional Estimates Bills: Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2006-2007, and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2006-2007. I shall introduce the latter Bill shortly.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The total appropriation being sought through the Supplementary Additional Estimates Bills is approximately $814.0 million, with $554.8 million being sought in Bill 5.

       <p class="italic">
        I now outline the major items provided for in the Bill.

        <li>
         These funding increases are partially offset by savings in 2006-07 of $33.7 million in other programmes.

        <li>
