         I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his question. Despite the laughter from those on the other side, this is a very serious question because the building and construction industry in Australia is our third largest employer. We should be congratulating them for that. One million Australians rely on the building and construction sector within Australia for their jobs. The sector is crucial to the Australian economy and clearly, employing that many people, it is important to the Australian people.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do know that there are certain cultural problems within the sector that cannot be ignored. These were highlighted recently with the release of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Bureau of Statistics
         </a>
         rates of industrial dispute. For example, 68 per cent of all work days lost during the December 2015 quarter were in the building and construction sector—that is, 68 per cent. The ABS data also shows that in the December quarter the rate of industrial dispute in the construction sector was over nine times the all-industries average. Let me put that in perspective. In the building and construction sector 16.7 days were lost per 1,000 employees. Compare that to the average of 1.8 working days across all industries. So 16.7 days in the building and construction sector compared to 1.8 days in all other industries. We on this side are concerned about the impact of that on productivity, growth and, ultimately, jobs for all Australians. These statistics are, quite frankly, staggering when you think that is 900 per cent over and above the all-industries average.

           Yes, I can. The Productivity Commission's

           is likely to have improved outcomes.

          <p>
           We had in 1992 the Gyles royal commission. In 2003, we had the Cole royal commission. Even the Wilcox review—and of course
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Wilcox" rel="nofollow">
            Murray Wilcox
           </a>
           was the inquirer hand-picked by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Even Mr Wilcox found a case for an industry regulator. And then of course we have the Heydon royal commission.
          </p>
          <p>
           On this side of the chamber, we are committed to jobs. We are committed to growth. We are committed to productivity. That is why we need to ensure that the rule of law is enforced within the building and construction industry.

             Yes, I can. As further evidence that this government is fostering the best possible conditions for jobs growth since coming to office, I can advise that in excess of 420,000 more people are in work. If you look at the 12-month comparison of this government, three times as many jobs have been created compared to the final 12 months of the former Labor government, when the now Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Workplace Relations.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a government that has a strong plan for jobs. We have a strong plan for growth—for example, our Innovation and Science Agenda, our record of delivering on free trade agreements and of course our commitment to funding Australia's infrastructure projects. What we need to know from those opposite, in particular in the light of the Leader of the Opposition's address to the

             today, is: are you going to rule out your job-killing carbon tax? It would appear that we are all going to go down that road yet again.
