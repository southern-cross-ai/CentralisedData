         : As at 30 April 2011, the Migration Review Tribunal-Refugee Review Tribunal (the tribunals) employed 272 staff.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) DIAC: As at 30 April 2011, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (including the Office of Migration Agents Registration Authority) had 163 employees who identify as having a disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         MRT-RRT: As at 30 April 2011, the tribunals had 10 employees who identify as having a disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) DIAC: The department's Recruitment Policy guides selection panels to ensure processes do not disadvantage applicants with a disability. All Independent Committee Members receive awareness training on how to accommodate people with disability at interview and are guided by Australian Network on Disability (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND" rel="nofollow">
          AND
         </a>
         ) resources made available as part of the department's membership. The department is soon to finalise a Reasonable Adjustment policy, developed in consultation with the Staff with Disability Network.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The department's Flexible Working Hours Strategy makes available the use of part-time employment, variable working hours, job sharing and home based work options.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The department launched a Workplace Diversity Strategy and supporting Implementation Plan 2011-13 on 15 March 2011. The strategy and plan identify people with disability as an area of priority in response to the downward trend in representation across the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service

        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         MRT-RRT: The tribunals support the employment of people with disability. Policies and programs in place include a Workplace Diversity Program and a Disability Action Plan. The tribunals accept applications from people with disability in different formats. The tribunals ensure that delegates and selection advisory committees are aware of the diverse needs of applicants with disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) DIAC: The Australian Network on Disability provides disability and mental health and well being awareness training for departmental supervisors and peers of staff with disability to ensure that the potential of these staff is realised. Further practical guidance and a framework for supporting employees with mental health issues is provided in the department's Mental Health Policy and Guidelines.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The department actively supports people with psychological issues in the workplace. These staff are assessed and supported by rehabilitation providers who liaise with their specialists and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Practitioners" rel="nofollow">
          General Practitioners
         </a>
         to ensure they remain active participants in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Workplace Implementation Plan 2011-13 includes initiatives to design and deliver a tailored mentoring program for employees with disability, and ensure all employees who identify as having a disability have a tailored career development program within their Performance Development Agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         MRT-RRT: The tribunals have a number of retention strategies in place for people with disability. Premises and facilities are accessible and useable by people with disability. Buildings provide level street access, are close to transport links and have facilities consistent with relevant laws and building codes. Flexible work arrangements are available to people with disability, including part-time employment and adjustments to hours of work. From time to time the tribunals provide training and/or awareness programs for managers and employees on mental health awareness.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) DIAC: The Workplace Diversity Implementation Plan 2011-13 includes initiatives to ensure all employees who identify as having a disability have a tailored career development program within their Performance Development Agreement, and make available appropriate reasonable adjustment (eg interpreters, captioning, loops, other assistive technology) to staff with disability to ensure they access learning and development opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         MRT-RRT: Career progression for people with a disability is available within the tribunals. Employees with a disability have opportunities to undertake training and study to improve their skills, to exercise team leadership roles and to seek transfers and promotions.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) DIAC: The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service Commission
         </a>
         has not identified specific targets for commonwealth agencies. The department is working towards increasing its representation of employees with disability. The Workplace Diversity Implementation Plan 2011-13 states that the department aspires to meet the goal of the Australian Public Service average benchmark of three per cent representation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         MRT-RRT: The tribunals do not have specific targets for the recruitment and retention of people with a disability as the Australian Public Service Commission does not specify any specific targets. However the Tribunals do report internally against the Australian Public Service average and is currently above the Australian Public Service average of three per cent with a representation of 3.7 per cent.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) DIAC: The department provides appropriate assistive technology or other access required by people disclosing a disability, and utilises government funded programs such as Job Access to ensure employees have appropriate access or adjustments to undertake their duties. Specialist disability agencies consult with the department and make recommendations for specific newly engaged employees.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A Staff with Disability Network was created in November 2010. The network provides the opportunity for staff with disability to share information, raise strategic issues and consult on policy and programs under development.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The department's Mental Health Policy and Guidelines provide information to ensure staff with mental health issues are well supported and maximise their potential in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The National Injury Prevention and Management Plan ensures that staff with injuries are identified and appropriately managed so as to limit deterioration in conditions, where possible. The Caring for our Colleagues policy enables departmental supervisors and co-workers to provide coordinated timely and sensitive support to departmental employees who have a life-threatening illness, or who are caring for a person with such an illness.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         MRT-RRT: The tribunals have a range of policies, programs and services to support staff with a disability, including a Workplace Diversity Program, a Disability Action Plan and flexible work arrangements such as part-time employment and adjustments to hours of work.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) DIAC: The department regularly meets with other
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">
          APS
         </a>
         agencies and key disability stakeholders to keep informed of best practice initiatives, programs and strategies. The department will be guided by future policy actions in the National Disability Strategy, launched in February 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Workplace Diversity Implementation Plan 2011-13 seeks to develop a Disability Action Plan to address levels of accountability within the department, and manage any obstacles to full participation for employees and clients with disability. Another initiative within the plan will see the inclusion of disability awareness materials and inclusive messages within learning and development programs for supervisors, managers and new staff.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         MRT-RRT: No additional policies, programs, services or plans are currently under development within the tribunals concerning the employment of people with a disability
