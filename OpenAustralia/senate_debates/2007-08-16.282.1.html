        In addition to my request to the minister, are there any details of how much this issue has been a problem given that he has just tabled that response? Is there any sign of any response to the rather more detailed and problematic issues raised in the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of

          </p>
          <p>
           This relates to schedules 2 to 5. We have had the substantive discussion on nearly all of these sections other than the infrastructure section and I would like to clarify a few points with the minister. This is an even more complicated part of the bill than some of the other parts so I would just like to clarify a few bits, please.
          </p>
          <p>
           My understanding is that part of this series of clauses is about ensuring the Commonwealth has ongoing involvement in the infrastructure after the five years. I understand that the provisions go to areas beyond just those that are covered in the emergency response areas but that particularly in emergency response areas there is a requirement for negotiation with the land council before any leases are granted.

            In response to your first question, yes, it does go beyond the prescribed areas. In fact it is for the entire
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern" rel="nofollow">
             Northern
            </a>
            Territory. The requirement for consent not only applies but it also applies throughout the areas in my first answer.

             My understanding is that before any of the infrastructure is built in any of the emergency response areas there has to be consent from the councils.

             <p>
              That is correct. If we are going to build particular long-term infrastructure, we have to have consent. That is not unlike the way it is now. It is a fairly informal arrangement. With the problematic issues about leasing, if you want to build a house, you get the consent of the landowner to be able to build the infrastructure. That was the way it was done and I suppose we have formalised the informal arrangements there in the absence of easily definable leasing arrangements. If we are going to put some infrastructure there, then we simply reflect the convention at the time, which was to seek consent to put the infrastructure up. That is what is reflected in that particular area.

                   Those statutory rights may be transferred to another person. I would like to know the range of other persons or bodies. Secondly, to transfer those rights, or for somebody else to be able to exercise those rights, does the funding body need to get the permission of the land council?

                    The only body they are referring to in terms of transfer is a government or a government authority. This does not refer to natural persons; this is referring only to a government or a government authority with the intent, of course, that the

                     That is the transfer of statutory rights; I understand that. But part 20Y says: ‘Rights holder may permit others to exercise the statutory rights’. I am asking: is that separate? I am not talking about the transfer, which I understand is only to another government body, but about the person who can exercise the rights. I understand they are not being transferred. I understand they are only being exercised.

                         interpret this to mean that the government goes in and builds some infrastructure or a service? I understand infrastructure includes service but, for the intent of this discussion, it is infrastructure on a lease that the Commonwealth now has. If they go in and build something, and then pass the exercising of their rights to another person or body—it could be a service provision organisation or a business—do they then not need the permission of the land council to do that?

                           then clarify how long that transfer lasts, because I understand the intent of this is that the Commonwealth maintains its interests in this infrastructure and services after the five-year sunset clause has gone. You do not need the permission of the land council to exercise the powers. It means that potentially you have someone going in there who can then exercise and use that lease beyond the sunset clause. Yesterday we were told that that was not possible.

                            I understand that, after they have been passed on, the rights holder may permit others to exercise those statutory rights. The holder of the rights then would be able to exercise those rights for as long as the original holder of the rights—which would be us—wished that to happen. So, if the question is whether—as a lot of the questions have been—it is to the end of the five-year lease, no, that is not the case.

                             In other words, what you told us yesterday does not in fact apply. I asked specifically yesterday—and I think other people had been asking too—whether a government could go in when they are acquiring land and then take something over five years. We were told that that was not going to happen. As I understand this, if the interpretation we have just worked out is correct, somebody can in fact come in and acquire control over land, through this process, beyond the five-year sunset clause, and the land council can do nothing about it.

                               I do not see that, because yesterday we were told that this would be five years under Commonwealth control and that would be it. Now, in these specific areas, another entity that the Commonwealth is allowing to exercise their rights can come in and do that—beyond the five years. I appreciate that we are now talking about leases; we are not talking about the whole town. But the fact is that that is the question we were asking yesterday about businesses. You may remember we did have a discussion—or it could have been this morning—when I was asking that specific question about businesses coming in that the community does not really want in there and does not necessarily agree with. I do no want to revisit the argument about what is good. They probably do want most of them in there but there may be some who do not. You know as well as I do that there are some businesses that communities specifically do not want in their community. To me, this provision, if I am correct—and from what we have just worked out, I think I am correct—means that they can go in there and they will not be out after five years.

                                That is correct. I think the reason I said it was consistent is that we are now discussing a completely different provision. This provision talks about the nature of the issues beyond the five-year period we were discussing either this morning or yesterday.

                                   I have another question and that relates to the fact that the argument for the acquisition of land and the emergency powers is that it is so that government can go in to get things happening quickly with the provision of infrastructure. You are saying that it then needs to be negotiated with the land council. The argument that the government has been putting is that we need to do this because we do not have the time to negotiate. That is why I asked that question before about land councils and what would happen if they say no, because what you are saying is that the government does not have any other powers under these provisions to say, ‘You’ll do it anyway.’ You do have a provision that says ‘must commence to negotiate’. It may be that I am interpreting that differently or putting the emphasis in the wrong place, but does ‘must commence to negotiate’ mean ‘You have to talk to us’?

                                      Someone is shaking their head and I am probably going to get in strife for this. As I read it, if you did not have consent, you would not expect to retain any interest in that after the five-year period. You would not be able to retain any interest in the infrastructure—that is, if you could do that. But that is not our intent. You would not seek to do that, so we would always seek consent. It is not part of the debate, but I appreciate the complexity of these issues. With our powers, we are running different provisions. If you require a brief on this matter, I will undertake to provide that to you.

                                       All the areas in the act are complicated. I acknowledge that we did have a briefing and I appreciate that, but these provisions continually reference back to each other and they are even more complicated than a lot of the other ones. The specific concern we have with this is around this issue of the Commonwealth, as the funding body and the holder of the statutory rights, then being able to hand over the rights to another person and it is not specified who that person could be. My understanding from these provisions is that it is completely left open. I understand that the Commonwealth retains ownership of the infrastructure but it can hand it over for use under this provision and that does not have to be with the agreement of the land council. That is of concern.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       I have another question, which may be technical. If it is going to be too technical, I would appreciate the briefing. In subdivision D, on page 30, it says:
                                      </p>
                                      <p class="italic">
                                       (1) If a person has the statutory rights under 20W and 20X—
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       which are the two sections we were just talking about—
                                      </p>
                                      <p class="italic">
                                       the person may, by writing, determine that the buildings or infrastructure is no longer required by the person.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Is that the person deciding they do not want it anymore and just saying, ‘We don’t want it anymore?’ or is this another person determining that you cannot use it anymore?

                                        I am advised that the statutory rights will end when a government or a government authority determine that they no longer require the buildings or infrastructure. The relevant land council must be advised of the termination of those rights and may require the former statutory rights holders to remove some of the infrastructure—they cannot just leave it there. This is going to ensure that the land is not encumbered by disused buildings or unwanted infrastructure.

                                             . This question has probably been answered, so I am sorry if I have missed it. People ask me questions about this all the time, so it is helpful if I can be accurate. Are they subject to a sunset clause or are they continuing? That was the only clarification I wanted around that schedule.

                                               I also want to clarify some items in schedule 1 to do with prohibited material—that is, pornography. Not being familiar with the fine print of the different classifications in respect of pornographic material and the like, the material that is classified as level 1 prohibited material basically seems to be material that is classified as X—in that sort of sphere of things. My understanding of all that is that any possession of X-rated material anywhere in prescribed areas in Aboriginal communities in the Territory would be prohibited and subject to a penalty.

                                               Under the section to do with supplying  material into prescribed areas it says that the person commits an offence which is subject to a penalty of 200 penalty units or imprisonment for two years or both. It says the material consists of five or more items of prohibited material. The way that reads to me is that if somebody had five

                                                 I have a final question on this, which is probably similar to some of the questions you were asked about alcohol yesterday, about the education provisions or information provisions regarding pornography. This might have been touched on a bit yesterday. You are talking about there being information and education first, before the enforcement stuff kicks in, so that people have a bit of time to adjust. I want to ask about the mechanisms for that and, while we are at it, for the alcohol issue. I am thinking of retailers as well, because, whatever people may or may not think of this material, it is legally available. As we all know, there is more of it around the corner down the road in Canberra than pretty much anywhere else in the country. But I am thinking of people in the Territory and perhaps people coming from outside and going to communities who may have some material on them. How widespread will the information campaigns be and what will be the nature of the campaigns? I can foresee people being inadvertently caught up in this sort of thing, and more so for people coming from outside, when we are dealing with material that is legal everywhere else. Certainly category 1 material, as I understand it, is legal everywhere else; category 2 material is not. So there would need to be a reasonable amount of education.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                 I think people are somewhat more likely to be aware of the concept of the prohibition on alcohol going into Aboriginal communities, but they are probably not so familiar with the concept of prohibition on this sort of material. I would like some indication of the type of information and education campaigns there are likely to be for this, perhaps alongside the alcohol area, which does have its complexity as well. I think that was touched on yesterday, in terms of how you determine what 350 millilitres is and how people are likely to know those sorts of things.

                                                  I think it was yesterday. I reiterate that throughout these processes we are going to need very much for the community to have a clear understanding. I have some sympathy: 350 millilitres—how much is that? I haven’t got a clue! I am old enough to remember that a 40-pounder is a 40-ounce bottle; now it is in millilitres. The communities will need to have a very clear understanding of that. As the senator indicates, sometimes the alcohol could be the easiest side of that. It is a very complex area. But an education program will be rolled out. We are working with the

So I think with that partnership I have a high level of confidence that the education program will be very effective.

                                                    I understand the classifications are very similar. I will have to seek some advice on that. The classifications deal with violence as well as sexually explicit material, as you are no doubt aware, Senator, but I will have to seek some advice on the nature of the classifications because they can sometimes occur simultaneously. My very basic understanding of the censorship process is that they are taking it into consideration in terms of the classifications, but I will seek a more fulsome answer to that question on notice, if I could.

                                                     I would like to know what information the government was working on when it decided that pornographic material was to be prohibited but not violent material. There have been no public statements regarding violent material, but there is a lot of literature and studies to show that that can be extremely influential on people in non-

                                                     communities. So far as I know, none of the statements by Minister Brough or Prime Minister Howard have canvassed the culture of violence that is abroad at the moment. A lot of it is imported from America. We see on our television sets people being dismembered, tortured—terrible things happening to human beings—in the name of entertainment. I wondered what impact that has on communities and what measurement of that impact the government has and why it has not acted on that. I presume, and the minister can tell me if I am wrong, that there has been an assessment of the impact of pornographic sexually explicit material. I am just wondering why the government has been quiet on violent material but very, very loud indeed on pornographic material.

                                                      The senator’s presumption that we had not dealt with the violent aspect was incorrect. My assumption that the categories in fact did include the depiction of violence is correct. Both category 1 and category 2 have a depiction of violence as well as sexual activity to put them into those categories. So if it is just violent—there is no sexual activity; it is just something that depicts violence—it will be prohibited as a category 1 or a category 2. So that has been taken into consideration.

                                                      With regard to your second question, there has been a lot of discussion. I am not sure about what empirical science you draw on, but certainly a lot of the evidence has been given around the place. The concern about pornography was principally about the grooming of young people. Again, I do not have the capacity or the knowledge to go into any more than what grooming means generally, or preparing or encouraging. I am not sure how you would prepare, but the term used is ‘grooming’ young people to make them more vulnerable to sexual predators.
                                                     </p>
                                                     <p>
                                                      So the pornographic material was the very first concern. Violence is obviously of concern, and the government have very ably dealt with that. But our first and principal concern was to act in those areas that have been reported. That is why much of the discussion was focused on the sexually explicit material rather than the violent material. The violent material has been comprehensively dealt with in the provision.

                                                       Violence is an enormous problem in the community. I am not going to draw the minister further on this, because it will not get me anywhere, but the point I make is that there is an attitude of accommodation for gratuitous violence that goes way beyond that which goes to non-violent sexually explicit material. That is a cultural thing. That is a Western and American cultural thing. It makes violence an entertainment. It makes huge amounts of money for some people. Whatever the classification system here is, the public presentation of the need for this legislation has been all about pornography and not about violence when it comes to the material that is to be classified and prohibited. I think the government should look at that again. I am concerned about the impact of gratuitously violent material, masquerading as entertainment, on the whole of the nation, and the lack of restraint by government on explicitly violent material as against explicitly sexual material.

Whatever merit there is or is not in encouraging more responsible behaviour or better protection of children through the quarantining of welfare payments, I do not see how that can justifiably be applied on a racial basis. In effect, that is what this legislation as a whole does. It provides welfare-quarantining mechanisms in a whole lot of different capacities, but, with regard to Aboriginal people in prescribed communities in the

It is a pretty clear example of where, to your average person looking at it, it sure looks like tougher rules for the blackfellas than for the whitefellas. Unless there are extremely good reasons, and it can be clearly demonstrated that it is positive discrimination for the blackfellas to get that type of so-called special treatment, then it is an extremely dangerous and potentially quite destructive thing to do.

                                                          I note that a number of people, again who have been broadly supportive of the government’s approach, have nonetheless called for the same sort of non-blanket approach to be taken in the Territory communities with regard to Aboriginal people as is being taken with the more selective application, such as that being proposed in the

So it is only in the Territory and in designated Aboriginal communities where that distinction between those who are responsible and those who are not is not being made, where it is being applied universally. It sure looks like racial discrimination to me. Obviously, the Racial Discrimination Act does allow that to occur, where it is positive discrimination or what are labelled ‘special measures’. I find it pretty hard to see how this is a special measure that is a positive discrimination. It is no secret that this whole model of quarantining is influenced fairly heavily, at least in terms of the public presentation of the debate, by what has been considered over a period of time and developed in Cape York, with the welfare trials that are close to being started up there.

                                                          is a key driver of that, and he has also said a number of times that the same principle needs to be applied in the Territory—that there needs to be a distinction between responsible and irresponsible people and that you need to reward positive behaviour. Almost regardless of that debate, if you are looking at the justification for saying that these are special measures and therefore are positively beneficial to Aboriginal people, and you have one of the key Aboriginal defenders of the government’s approach saying, ‘No, this is the wrong way to go; it’s not going to be the best for them,’ then you really have to wonder how solid the government’s assertion is that this is a positively discriminatory or special measure. That highlights the problem with trying to use this catch-all loophole in the Racial Discrimination Act. In some ways this measure looks particularly stark and problematic, and I have not heard any justification to date—unless the minister before us has an absolutely fabulous, rip-snorting justification that he is about to unleash on us—for that type of exemption. I should state again that that is a very fundamental principle. We have pretty much had this debate already, so I shall not talk further. But I do not want that to be taken as any suggestion that we are treating this issue as a run-of-the-mill thing. The Racial Discrimination Act is fundamental. That point needs to be made as often as possible.

As we know, there is a five-year sunset clause, but the minister has the capacity, as I understand, to annually revisit the question of the income management provisions and the areas to which they will apply. We think it is important that the minister formally review the success of the scheme after 12 months. We are going into uncharted waters in terms of income management and applying these measures in communities. It is important that we look as soon as possible at the effectiveness of the measures taken. I think it is important that the parliament gets the opportunity to debate the measures—not just have the government say that it has some sort of internal review—and gets the chance to have a look at whether or not these measures are working and, if they are not, see why not and have some assessment of all these changes. For example, there are a range of initiatives relating to school attendance, and we would want to know whether the measures have had any impact on school attendance—rather than just press on on the basis that we hoped they might and we continued to hold that hope.
                                                                  </p>
                                                                  <p>
                                                                   It is important that we assess these things. It is, as I say, a major change in arrangements. There are concerns that whole communities are being required to comply with these changes. People are not being assessed according to their own individual behaviour when it comes to these measures; they are actually being required to comply with the system. One of my concerns with the approach is: where is it that we reward positive behaviour? Where are the mechanisms that allow those who do the right thing to be rewarded? Where is that encouragement for personal responsibility in the long term? But that is a more general point.
                                                                  </p>

I know the minister has given some general undertakings about reviews, but we would much prefer that there be a legislative review after 12 months of the welfare reform and the income management system specific to the Northern Territory.

So any appreciation of the results at one particular arbitrary point in time, say in a 12-month review, will not necessarily provide the evidentiary process you require. The minister has the capacity, on the basis of the time he rolls them out, to examine how the programs are working on a community-by-community basis.

The revolution was a squib and the people who suffered as a result of the failure of the revolution were the Indigenous people upon whom we were conducting that particular experiment.

We talk the language inside the Public Service, but we do not put it into the bills. I would like to know who is accountable for this stuff and who is going to lose their job if it does not happen as planned. I do not want to have a crack at the FaCSIA officials, but no politician and no departmental official is responsible when failure occurs. We are being asked again to take it on trust. I hope it works; I really hope it works. But it is another experiment; it is another stab in the dark. This government has had three or four; we had a few when we were in government. None of them worked; none of them made a fundamental difference to the lives of the people in these communities.

The parliament ought to force the minister and the government, of whatever persuasion, back into this place to say, ‘Yes, it has worked in terms of alcohol control, but school attendances have not improved,’ or whatever the outcome is and explain what is working, what is not working and why not. We should not just give you a blank cheque so that someone can quietly drop a report that the opposition spokesperson has to find by nefarious means, that says that the whole thing was a disaster and that for the last year or two people have been skating around admitting that it was a disaster. That is not good enough. It is not good enough in terms of public administration, but it is also not good enough for the Indigenous people.
                                                                    </p>

It would be a huge blue to not demand accountability for the measures that we take. We need key performance indicators and a real sense of accountability from the policymakers and those delivering the service. We say that these measures are going to improve Aboriginal people’s lives. Let us prove it; let us hold ourselves accountable. The minister’s response reeks as being the sort of response we have had for every other experiment: things are allowed to quietly slip away as the political attention and the circus moves on and no-one is held accountable for the fact that we did not deliver to Indigenous people what we promised. I think that this is the most important clause that should be in the bill, but I know that it will not get carried. I and others will be much more assiduous about ensuring that there is proper reporting and measurement than perhaps we have been in the past.

There will be a review of circumstances. On the basis of those circumstances, he will decide whether or not to continue the program. That is in fact a review, Senator Evans. I am not being picky; I am just saying that I do not think that we are that far apart on this. We are practically reflecting the timing of the implementation of the programs. Thank you for the support.

Unfortunately, during the short time that we had during the committee process, we did not get to ask many questions on this quite far-reaching legislation. Not only that, the answers to the questions that we put on notice—with all due respect to whoever wrote them—provided us with little additional information. So, unfortunately, I am going to have to ask them again—and take the opportunity to ask some much more detailed questions.

                                                                          </p>
                                                                          <p>
                                                                           The first issue that I would like to address is about people who are covered in section 123U(b)—persons who are subject to the income management regime in the relevant Northern Territory area. As I understand it, that is anybody who is in the area physically from 21 June to when their last payment period was. That is correct, I think. If you were there at that time, the provision catches you unless you have an exemption from the minister. You could be travelling in the area and have to get an exemption from the minister not to be caught up in this if you are getting the various forms of income support that are covered by these provisions.

While I am on feet—through you, Chair—I understand what you are saying about presence in the area. It says overnight in the area and it says other than if you are exempt. It says the secretary determines who is exempt. Then it goes through a series of things to determine who is exempt, but it seems to me you have to apply to be exempt.

For the record, I thought I should speak to the actual amendment. I had a couple of question about the schedules but I thought I would leave that until the final amendment. I want to indicate my support for the amendment. I think review of these provisions is important and, again, if the problem is 12 months I could cope with its being two years, but these are very far-reaching provisions, particularly the Territory ones and in the absence of any other outline already being in place for benchmarks, assessment criteria and those sorts of things. It would give much more confidence to a lot of people if there were something in the legislation that required an open and independent review.

This is a fairly clear principle and it was also a fairly straightforward concern that was expressed to the Senate committee.

Witnesses had less than two days notice to prepare submissions and only three days at best to read the actual legislation. There was seriously limited time to be able to explore all of these issues. I think the total amount of time I got to question officials from the government about the entire package of legislation was about eight minutes, so one can understand that there is a range of other issues one might have wanted to have raised.
                                                                                        </p>

Comparatively, there was very little about the whole income management regime. Given how major the change is, that is very unfortunate. That is not to say that I am 100 per cent opposed to at least exploring some of the principles here, although I am quite concerned with how they are being implemented, particularly with regard to the Territory.

I am not 100 per cent convinced it will work but, as the name implies, it is a trial. It has been done after a fair bit of consultation. There are differing views about the totality of that consultation but there has been a fair bit of it. One of the key aspects of it is to engage people at the local level to make decisions that relate to when people become subject to welfare quarantining. None of that is present in the

                                                                                         On top of that, as this amendment relates, there is no appeal mechanism. At one level you could say, ‘It’s automatic; your welfare is going to be quarantined, so what is there to be appealed?’ but there is a whole range of powers given under this legislation to government officials and Centrelink officers to make decisions about pretty fine details in people’s individual lives. I believe that there needs to be the same scope for an independent merits review of those sorts of decisions. Through this legislation we are giving brand-new powers to Centrelink officers to intervene in the very fine detail of people’s lives. People should not forget that.

That is an extra factor: people will be subject to this whether they like it or not and whether there is any justification for it other than where they live, which is in an Aboriginal community in the Territory. I do not think it is stretching things too far to imagine some people might get a little bit peeved about that. The potential is certainly there for people to get peeved if they are having decisions made about how they run their lives and they do not agree with those decisions. They may think the decisions are not fairly based or based on mistakes or misunderstandings of what people have said. Let us not forget that, in many cases, we are dealing with communities and people whose first language is not English and whose cultural understandings of things is very different to that of many other people. There is any amount of material about the difficulties of communication, even when people’s English is perfect, because there are different interpretations of cultural expression.
                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                         There is ample opportunity for misunderstanding, even with the best will in the world. When the detail of how you live your day-to-day life is going to be controlled by somebody else and there is a prospect of them making decisions about what you are allowed to do and what you are not allowed to do, including defining what is an essential and what is not an essential, that is difficult and groundbreaking enough, but to then say that there is no scope for independent review is a really serious problem. It is a problem because of the potential for injustice; that is why you have independent reviews. It is a problem because having the independent review can be a real safety valve for people. So even when the decision was right, if a person has been able to appeal to someone else—even though that person has said, ‘No, that’s right’—they are more likely to say, ‘Okay, someone else has verified that.’ It can be of assistance.

You can learn from that. That is particularly the case when you are dealing with a brand-new area. The people in the Territory are going to be the first people subjected to this, perhaps alongside the people in Cape York, although I do not think that will be up and running—the minister can correct me if I am wrong—as quickly as the Territory. Maybe Cape York will be next—and under very different circumstances—and then possibly, some time later, other people in the mainstream community will be subjected to it, but only those who are deemed to breach particular criteria regarding school attendance or child protection issues.
                                                                                        </p>

There is, I know, the scope for internal departmental review, but frankly that is just not good enough. To say that people can take things to court is frankly insulting, particularly with regard to the sorts of decisions that people are likely to want to appeal.
                                                                                        </p>
                                                                                        <p>
                                                                                         I do not like always drawing parallels to my experiences with this government’s activities in the migration and detention area but it has some echoes for me because we had immigration officials making decisions about people’s cases outside the normal mechanism and, when people were unhappy with the decisions, the only appeal they got was to someone else within the department. I know there is only so far you can go with this parallel but I think there is a valid comparison. If there is a mistake made by an officer, whether through a misunderstanding, incorrect information, sloppiness, shoddiness, overwork or whatever, internal reviews are not sufficient, particularly when the person doing the internal review knows that that is it. If you are doing a review and you know there is an independent person watching over your shoulder, you are much more likely to do a better job. I am not casting aspersions at public servants, but it is just human nature. If you like, I am casting aspersions at human nature; I can do that in great detail if I am in the right mood. It is human nature that, if you know someone is able to appeal your decision to someone who is independent, you will do your job a lot better than if you think: ‘I’ll just do this here; no-one else is going to ever look at it. Near enough is good enough.’
                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                         This is a really important issue. It was singled out for special concern by a number of submitters to the inquiry, so, particularly because this is new area, it needs to have those appeal rights. I do not see how any talk about this being an emergency somehow is sufficient to justify jettisoning people’s rights to independent appeal about decisions that really affect pretty fundamental aspects of their day-to-day lives. That is particularly given that, in the way the government have designed this package and this measure, there is no automatic linkage between the income quarantining and anything to do with child protection. It is universal. You say it is some emergency measure to do with protecting children, but there is no linkage to people’s behaviour; it is just where they live. In that context, it is pretty serious to take away this appeal right. Let’s not forget this is people’s money. It might be being paid under a welfare entitlement but it is their money. It is an entitlement, and it is called that for quite a genuine reason. If you have someone else coming in and telling you what you can and cannot spend your money on, which is enormous intervention in people’s lives, then the least you can do is give them some right to appeal if they do not agree with the decisions that are being made on their behalf.

But the definition of ‘unexplained absence’ differs slightly from place to place, and we are accepting the current definitions of ‘unexplained absence’ as they vary throughout the schools. They would be the provisions that are in existence now in each of those schools.

That is the reason principally behind it—that each jurisdiction will have a different rationale. Some might say, ‘If you don’t have a letter from a doctor then it is an unexplained absence.’ Some may have some other process of establishing whether an absence was an unexplained absence or otherwise. We would, again, rely on that jurisdiction for that advice.

In fact, it is unacceptable that any child should be away for that period of time. That is why we have said that it will be up to the jurisdiction, and it will be five days away without an explanation.

It has to be in writing and it will be personally handed over. Obviously there are some language and translation difficulties so it will be provided in writing in an interview situation. This ensures that they have actually got it. We appreciate all of those things.

It is in relation to Subdivision C—Miscellaneous about the payment of credit balance of income management account accounts when a person ceases to be subject to the income management regime. I will walk through my understanding of the process. Someone subject to the income management regime who receives a baby bonus will receive that bonus in monthly instalments. Am I to understand that the monthly instalments of the baby bonus will also be subject to the 50 per cent quarantining process?

A parent who has been subject to the income management regime has received the baby bonus and now has a significant credit balance in their income management account. Section 123WJ(7) relates to the repayment of the residual amount in the income credit to account. If a person moves out of the income management regime and is eligible for reimbursement, the secretary may determine that the ‘whole or a part of the residual amount is to be paid to the first person as a single lump sum’. But then in (9) it says:

Am I correct in reading that the lump sum must be $200 or less and that the rest will be paid in some kind of instalments?

Obviously, as I have just pointed out, the assistance of states and territories and the non-government schools sector will be called on. Arrangements for the provision of information from schools and education authorities will be the subject of those consultations and there will be assistance from the non-government education authorities in that regard. The particular consultation strategy that is under development at the moment is expected to include Australian government ministers consulting with state and territory education ministers; information provided to the Australian Education Systems Official Committee—and I understand the next meeting is scheduled for 24 August; ongoing consultations with state and territory governments and non-government education authorities; and Centrelink dealing with individual education authorities and schools as required.

Are there any projections? Is there a time frame within which we can expect school attendance to be improved and just what is that objective?

Both benchmarks and goals will be set within the community construct. We have a fair idea of how many people should be at school and are not enrolled, and we have an idea of how many people are enrolled and are not at school. With those statistics, we should have a pretty good idea of who is not attending. We will continue to use and build on those statistics. I think we all have to acknowledge that attendance records may not be consistent across the board, but certainly the intervention gives us this opportunity to ensure that the attendance records are taken in a way that can assist us in that matter.

What do you have in place with regard to funding for capital works, for more schools and for more teachers? Have you reached agreement with the Northern Territory government that they will adopt a more appropriate form of funding so that the resources are there in schools to accommodate not the average but the total number of students that should be in school? Obviously this is not going to happen overnight, and it would be useful to know what mechanisms you have in mind and have negotiated with the Northern Territory in this respect.

They will be in a position to assist in the matter of infrastructure—tables, desks and those sorts of things. We have also put in some funding for capital and infrastructure and those sorts of arrangements. Again, we will not be in an ideal position to know exactly what sort of expansion in infrastructure is needed until those assessments are made. We already acknowledge that in circumstances like those at Wadeye, where a lot more people suddenly turn up for school, we do need to have those pieces of infrastructure in place. Again, a fundamental part of our answer is in the partnership approach with the Northern Territory. We are discussing the circumstances with the Northern Territory, because they are responsible for providing those materials, and they have said that they will supply those materials. We will stand there and be ready to increase our contribution, but we have already made an offer and a contribution in terms of infrastructure.

I know you have in the appropriations bills some money for boarding schools, but it would appear that this is not going to be an option for all students of secondary school age. Can you give the committee a guarantee that there will be a secondary school available to all students where there is currently a primary school?

No, I am not in a position to guarantee that. You would be aware of the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories with regard to the funding of schools.

We would see that those arrangements would continue. But, no, I am not a position to guarantee that wherever there is a primary school we are going to build a high school.

I think we would all accept that that is going to be a lot fairer, certainly on the schools in terms of some of the planning. At least with the enrolment we know we can plan and budget rather than relying on fluctuating attendance levels. There was one other question and I have been informed that the answer to it is yes, but, frankly, I think it would be better if you could repeat the question.

I have been into schools where 14- and 15-year-olds are in classrooms with primary school students because they want to keep learning but there is no option for them to go to a secondary school. I am surprised that this is not central to what you are doing. You appear to be very concerned about those young people who are not employed and have no occupation and not a very good education. One of the reasons they do not have a good education is that there is no education facility for them. There may be a primary school but, as I said, in many communities I have been into there is quite a large community of secondary school age students but no provision whatsoever for educating them. If this whole approach is going to work and we are going to improve the economies of Aboriginal communities then it seems to me this is fundamentally important. I am surprised you do not have a grasp of the extent of the problem, and some sort of solution to fix it.

The usual excuse that is trotted out is that this is a state and territory issue and it is not something the Commonwealth has jurisdiction over. Well, we know the Commonwealth can intervene in whatever it likes. It funds schools and, in my view, it should have used its leverage of funding to extract from state and territory governments a decent education system for Indigenous students.

It is because there are no resources there. It is because schools are equipped for a much smaller number of kids than should be there. In the case of secondary school, it just is not available in so many areas. I do not know so much about

My understanding is that we have just moved and passed a motion and are about to start prayers. I seek clarification on that, Mr President.

He wants 25 nuclear power stations in Australia. I note that he is not having referenda on those. But, to make some money for some of his mates in the mining industry, he is prepared to put the safety of Australia—and, indeed, this very fraught planet—on the line.

This is a Prime Minister who has a greater connection with the big end of town than he has with the younger generation of Australians who are going to have to live with the results of this. This is a Prime Minister who has failed to make us the environmentally advanced country that we should be, with the renewable energy technology that we should have, exporting that safely to the rest of the world, which wants to substitute the climate change fraught energy options with those which are safe.

I have some questions for the minister around a number of the provisions that we have not explored yet. Regarding CDEP, I think we have established fairly well, both in the chamber and in the inquiry process, that, though the numbers vary, there are about 7,000 people on Community Development Employment Projects who will be moved to income support or Work for the Dole. As I understand it, and there is some dispute over the figures, there are around 2,000 to 2,500 real jobs.

So we are moving those people. If it is a Commonwealth position and it should be paid for by the Commonwealth, it needs to be a full-time position, not a CDEP training position with top-up. In the last budget the Commonwealth committed significant sums of money to pay for that. We would expect it will be the same for those people being paid for local government positions—and for the

There are also jobs in the community funded under CDEP that in fact are not Commonwealth. They may not be classed as local government jobs but they are jobs in communities—for example, art centres that are funded by communities but only function because they are receiving CDEP. A lot of communities, as you know, depend on those jobs for some key services. How is it envisaged that those jobs will be funded from now on? I have received a number of letters, and I am sure you have as well, from communities expressing concern that, once CDEP goes, they will not be able to fund those positions any longer—and they are not necessarily Commonwealth positions. How do you intend dealing with those positions?

Yes, a number of art centres have enjoyed subsidised workers—I think it is reasonable to say that that is the case, Senator. But, most importantly, those are training positions and there is a reasonable expectation that, after 12 months access to a subsidised training position, the employer, which would be an arts centre, would have a plan to move that individual from a training position to a full-time position.

But, Minister, as you know—and I am sure many other people know—the rhetoric is all very well but there is in fact not the money to do that. It became plain through the Senate committee inquiry on arts and craft, which we have been talking about throughout this debate, that the arts centres provide many services beyond what would be classed as running as an arts centre. Essentially, they are multifunctional centres. They provide community support, they provide a broad range of training, they support artists—they do all sorts of things beyond just administering the arts centres. That is very well known. So it is all very well for the rhetoric to say that they should be moving on, but the fact is that the money is not there to do that at the moment.
                                                                                                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                                                                                                          I am using arts centres as an example. There are other services that communities provide based on CDEP as well, and you know as well as I do that it is all very well to say that they should be profitable et cetera, but the fact is that, at the moment, they are not and it is very difficult for them to get there. So communities are going to suffer when the CDEP money goes from those organisations if there is not something to help there. I am glad that the Commonwealth has identified those 2,000 jobs, and, while I am on my feet, I ask: are all the Commonwealth positions that are currently supported by CDEP going to be replaced by full-time positions?

That is correct. All of the jobs will be replaced with full-time jobs, and we would encourage the other jurisdictions to provide the same leadership. Before I go towards giving you some comfort about those circumstances that I know you are very aware of, Senator, it is important to note that one of the reasons that there is not a bigger capacity in places like arts centres and all those sorts of things is that they are very comfortable where they are because they have this access. They do need to start thinking about their responsibility to move people forward. That is something that is clearly signalled and that we all need to think about.
                                                                                                                                                                          </p>

So, in terms of having an increased capacity to continue to deliver a range of services, the Work for the Dole programs will be available and they will be vastly increased. It should also be noted that there is a net increase in the total services funding of $23.3 million. In terms of the employment programs, there will be a significant impact on ensuring people get that upskilling and a general support network within those communities. But we recognise the importance of the circumstances in the communities with regard to the CDEPs. We do need some sort of a Work for the Dole program, and the Work for the Dole programs will be vastly expanded.

Thank you: I can see somebody nodding. My next question goes back to an issue that we identified during the arts inquiry—and I am using arts centres as an example because it is one that we have just been dealing with—which is that some arts centres, because of their area, the access to the artists and all sorts of things, are much more able to cope with moving down to a profitable outcome, and some—because of their areas et cetera—cannot.

Is that something that the government would consider to help identify organisations that need some extra support to be able to become profitable, to be self-supporting and to do exactly what you have been talking about?

Many people on CDEP have not actually been in training; they are just there or at work. So we will be providing structured training through the STEP program. And, as I have said, there will be an expansion of Work for the Dole.

I want to go back to the difference between the money that is coming out of CDEP and the money that is now going into income support.

Is that really what is happening? How is the government making up the difference between income support for people and CDEP?

I think that is the best way to look at how we will provide for that gap. In getting some details with regard to the transition payment, I was informed that for a 12-month period we will be ensuring that the gap, or the difference, between what they would have got on CDEP and the training wage will be filled. So, effectively, there will not be a change for a 12-month period. That is to ensure that we maintain income support for that transitional period of around 12 months.

I appreciate that some of my questions are budget related, but does that come out of the $46.9 million that you identified in your answer to one of my earlier questions, or is it on top of it?

Work for the Dole has the connotation of taking people to do work that does not involve reskilling. That would be a lost opportunity because a lot of these people will be young and facing a lifetime ahead. They have lost opportunities through the education system up to now. What is the emergency opportunity being given to all people who are being taken off the CDEP to be reskilled to go into a worthwhile job that actually capitalises on their potential?

We have a literacy and numeracy package of some $5 million. It is targeted at both literacy and numeracy because they are both essential in the workplace. We have $1.3 million specifically for the English language.

There is a disjunction between those two things. I want to know that they are going to meet up wherever a person who has been taken off the CDEP is and that they are going to be able to gain that literacy and numeracy in their own community and not just be put into a job where the prospect of being able to do something better to tap into their potential is not available because they will not be given the catch-up that is required because of lost educational opportunities.

We need to respect that each individual will have different needs. Some have high literacy and numeracy skills. Each individual will be assessed against a range of benchmarks that will give us an indication of exactly what sort of training they require. It will be done on an individual basis. Anybody who needs literacy and numeracy training will receive it.

There are estimates of 5,000 to 10,000 people being taken off CDEP and put elsewhere. The point is that that is a one-size-fits-all move. The government is saying, ‘We are going to make a big move on that.’ And so the government has a responsibility to make sure that people move to something better, more productive and—I would say—more lucrative for the work that they produce as a result of it. The CDEP move has the hallmarks of being punitive. It ought not to be. It ought to be aimed at making sure that the individuals involved end up better off.

I put a few questions on notice and got some very short answers.

Because the facilities in each community are going to be different, we are going to have to tailor this program around the differences in those communities. In terms of mobility, we are looking at a suite of issues. We are speaking with the finance sector and with the retail sector, and, with the assistance of Mr Corbett and others who have a great deal of expertise in this area, we are formulating processes so that people will have access that reflects the mobility of people on the program. We will be ensuring that the program will reflect, in the different range of stores that the voucher system will be provided for, the mobility and flexibility needed.

We are not going to be rolling this out in any community until these arrangements are in place. We are speaking and consulting with the communities as to how best to achieve that. It is going to be an ongoing rollout. I think the most important thing to say is that we do not want to say, ‘Right, this program is now in place,’ and find that the financial aspects are not there. The commitment is that we will not be moving to the program in a community until those arrangements are effective, in place and well understood.

How did you come to that figure, and, as it is anticipated that that is for the first 12 months, how much is it likely to cost into the future if the minister decides to extend it?

We are very concerned that these are blunt instruments that are not going to be successful. To my mind there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate that they are going to achieve their aims, and there is a gross lack of detail about how these are going to operate. You can appreciate that there are a lot of people out there that are extremely concerned about how these systems are going to operate and concerned that they will have a negative impact in many of the communities. I went through some of those impacts yesterday when I went through the impact of the special measures and what

You will be aware, Senator, that many of the social justice and welfare organisations in this country are very concerned about this program—I think, quite rightly—and are asking a whole lot of questions about how it is going to be implemented, what your benchmarks are and where the evidence is to say this is going to work.

I apologise; I may have missed your answer with all the other answers you have been giving me. Is it envisaged that you would go into a relationship with somebody to administer this program or is it the government’s intention for it to remain administered by Centrelink?

As I said, we have a whole suite of options. Some of them are reflected in other jurisdictions and some are from private enterprise. There are a whole suite of things, and I do not think it is appropriate to say we are certainly not going to do this or that. We have an open mind on these matters and I think that is appropriate for this stage of consideration.

We do not know how much it is going to cost to roll it out, who is going to operate it or how it is going to operate. This place is being asked to approve this and tick it off to say, ‘Yeah, this is a really good way of reforming our welfare system,’ when we do not know how much it is going to cost, what its impact will be, who is providing it or how it is going to be provided.

I want to backtrack just a little—I promise it will be for only a very short time. I want to ask about the appeal, where you said to me that people on the eight-week breach regime will not be caught up by the no-appeal system. Could somebody point out to me where that is in the legislation? I have spent time going through it and I apologise that I cannot find it. If somebody could point it out, I would really appreciate it.

There are 1,644 people who have been breached and incurred eight weeks non-payment period in the last 12 months. It has gone up by 250 per cent and we know that Aboriginal people already are having trouble accessing their appeals. There is a special support appeals process for Aboriginal people.

If people cannot appeal when they have been breached, that has a very serious, detrimental impact on them, their families and their community. That is why I am being so particular about trying to find out about this. The way I read it is that, if you are under an income management regime, I cannot see why you are not breached. That is why I want to make sure it is really clear that people absolutely can appeal if they are breached and incur a non-payment period.

He said that the point here was to have compulsory health checks. These were held up as an immediate need. We had pictures of doctors with stethoscopes going to the Northern Territory to check children ‘to identify any effects of abuse’—to quote the minister. And the first 850 checks have found zero effects of abuse.

But on the day this announcement was made I also made it clear that it would be a breach of medical ethics and of the law to compulsorily examine children—those were the terms being used—for sexual abuse. Has the minister had time to review the overstatement and the abuse of Indigenous people right across the country that came out of those statements to proceed with this measure that the government wanted to proceed with, and all the things we have been talking about in this parliament going ahead anyway because the government has got the numbers to do it?

In fact, those checks have not discovered sexual abuse.

I think it was reprehensible and regrettable. It was not needed. The government has the outcome.

We agree with the government putting the resources at last where they are needed.

I give those figures again of 34,000 reportable cases of child abuse in the last year for which there are statistics, some 6,000 relating to Indigenous communities. That is a disproportionate amount, but nevertheless we are in the situation where the laws here are going to allow the invasion of people’s homes and the surveillance of Indigenous people but not of white people. Sexual abuse of children, wherever it occurs, has the same destructive impact on people’s lives. I think it was enormously unfortunate that Mr Brough and the Prime Minister used that one measurement of distress in Indigenous communities to try and win over the political support that was required for the measures that are going through this parliament today—regrettable and unnecessary. A real concern for Indigenous Australians would not have allowed it to be pitched that way.

We would all hope that is the case, though I suspect it is not. Senator Brown, you are a doctor and I am not, so again you may be across the indicators of neglect and abuse. This is a necessary process to have a benchmark for the health of young Australians. The parents have welcomed that. Australia welcomes that. The suite of initiatives that this government is providing through these provisions is going to make the lives of Australians in those communities much better. Just living under the veil of safety; feeling happy, safe and comfortable in your own home; and actually having a home that you do not have to share with so many people—the infrastructure issues—are all very positive aspects that are supported by all Australians.

We accept you have made it very clear that you accept we should be doing most of the things we are doing, except in this place every amendment you have collapses and scuttles the bills completely. I have a difficulty and I am sure Australia has a difficulty in understanding how you can stand in this place and say: ‘Senator Scullion, I support everything this government is doing. We think they’re good things. We think they’re overdue. But every amendment we put forward completely scuttles everything, with the exception of the alcohol restriction and a couple of other minor areas.’ Effectively, the provisions that you seek to wipe from this bill wipe out any real impact. I have a bit of cynicism, Senator, that you are fair dinkum about this. Any glance at or scrutiny of the amendments you have put forward shows your attempts to scuttle the bill. I find that a little inconsistent.

To close that longevity gap would cost approximately half a billion dollars according the AMA, and there is a move in that direction but it is not in this legislation.

We absolutely support children having medical checkups as part of that program. As the task force commander, Major General Chalmers, revealed yesterday, the checks have uncovered a range of medical concerns including high levels of dental problems and skin, ear, nose and throat infections. It is long past time that the medical services that would fix those illnesses were available in these communities—for example, there are extraordinary statistics in relation to the loss of hearing because of ear infections in Indigenous communities. They largely come out of the failure to provide adequate medical advice—primary health care—and then treatment when the problems arise.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </p>

There are thousands more places needed at schools if there are going to be the same attendance figures at these schools that we have elsewhere. But the point I am making here is that it would have been much better for the honourable Minister Brough to announce that he was going in to attack the dreadful statistics for Indigenous Australians dying young, not just in the

You only have to look at the statistics in Redfern to see an example of that, fantastic though the medical services provided by the Indigenous community there are. Minister Brough did not use those statistics; he chose to pick on the equally appalling statistics of child sexual abuse—and so did the Prime Minister—as a fulcrum for this move.

It was advantageous to the government but devastating for Indigenous communities. It was surely a political advantage for the government but a very great disadvantage for Indigenous Australians, who have enough to put up with in terms of the way in which they are publicly presented. I am glad that the medical interventions occurred, and I am glad that the high levels of health problems suffered by Indigenous children have been uncovered and will be fixed up. That is how it should have been decades ago, but now at last it is happening because the money and resources are being put in there. We did not need calumny about the Indigenous people to get this action going; that is my point. We cannot undo that now, but thinking about how Indigenous people are portrayed and their need for pride in self—the same need that all of us have—would have been a better way to go, from the outset. There is good coming out of this. I agree with Senator Scullion about that, and I congratulate the government for that, but it was most unfortunate the way that Minister Brough went about it and I hope he does not do that again.

Locking people up without helping them to take a different path into the future is a very wasteful exercise for society as a whole.

I have many, but I will keep it to one; some of my questions were asked on notice in the Senate committee hearing. I want to get on the record whether the appropriation bills before us include funding for the extra Centrelink staff that will be required to do all the income quarantine management that we talked about earlier this morning and last night. How many extra staff are anticipated to be required for that role?
