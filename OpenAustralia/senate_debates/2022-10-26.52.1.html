        Last night we heard the federal Treasurer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Chalmers" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Chalmers
        </a>
        , deliver his first budget. He delivered a solid and sensible budget, one that delivers for the Australian people—where the Australian people had voted for the Labor government. Our plan will help not just tackle the cost of living but also deliver important local community infrastructure. I will take the opportunity I have for the next two minutes to talk about the critical infrastructure programs that have been funded by the Albanese Labor government in the electorate of Deakin.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm not going to attempt to go through all the details of the budget in the two minutes that I have, Senator Canavan, but I want to touch on a couple of budget commitments that are important to communities in the electorate of Deakin. I also want to acknowledge, on the record, the hard work, dedication and championing of these projects by our candidate in the last election. Unfortunately, he wasn't successful but
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gregg" rel="nofollow">

        —an outstanding individual who was not just passionate but really committed—lives and thrives in the electorate and really has a connection. I think he deserves recognition for the hard work he did in the lead-up to the last election.
       </p>

        The budget delivered last night delivers on our election commitment for a $5 million wellbeing precinct in Croydon. This precinct will deliver safe, modern spaces for community groups to meet and connect existing services in Croydon. Our budget also delivers $500,000 for new sports field lighting at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croydon_Park" rel="nofollow">

        oval. Clubs, including Croydon Football Club,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croydon_Cricket_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Croydon Cricket Club
        </a>
        and the Croydon Netball Club, have done a fantastic job in increasing participation in community sport, particularly amongst juniors and women. This lighting is essential to ensure that they can accommodate increased participation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has also allocated $1 million to redevelop Forest Hill Reserve, where there is also demand for facilities to allow more junior and women's sports. Labor is also making a $3½ million investment in an undercover basketball court at the local Croydon Primary School. This will obviously be of great utility to the school but, importantly, it's also to be shared with the wider community. There is huge demand for basketball facilities in Victoria, particularly in the eastern suburbs, and these are great examples of how Labor is delivering for our community.
