        (2)   Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 12), after item 2, insert:

        2A  Section 5 (definition of

       <p>
        Senator Crossin may wish to add to her comments in the second reading debate in relation to this issue. These amendments deal with the specific issue of the inclusion of Christmas Island. This issue was canvassed in the second reading debate. Both Labor senators and also Senator Stott Despoja raised the issue of the redrafted national code removing one of the barriers to the extension of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESOS" rel="nofollow">
         ESOS

        regime to Christmas Island.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment" rel="nofollow">
         Amendment
        </a>
        s (1) and (2), moved by the opposition, essentially have the effect of inserting Christmas Island into the definition of ‘state’ in the act and, as we understand it, extend the application of the regime to Christmas Island. I would be grateful if the parliamentary secretary would be able to indicate whether the government intends to agree to these amendments.

         The government at this point in time will not be agreeing to the amendments, although I note Senator Crossin’s comments in her presentation in the second reading debate in relation to the letter that she has received from the minister. On behalf of the government, I can confirm the in-principle support for the provision of services out of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p>
         There are some issues, however, that we are currently negotiating with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         Department of Education and Training. Also, the Department of Education, Science and Training has been discussing with the

          Department of Transport and Regional Services
         </a>
         ways in which this recommendation could be implemented. So some work is being done in relation to that. There are some complex administrative issues that are associated with this recommendation which we are currently working on. We anticipate that amendments to these bills to implement this recommendation could be brought forward in a further amendment bill in 2007 once the administrative matters that we are dealing with have been resolved.

          My query is on the final version of the national code. Because

            I have one issue. Senator Colbeck said, ‘We are happy to do this later once we have sorted out some of the administrative details.’ I am not trying to verbal you, Senator Colbeck, but I think that is reasonably accurate. Given that this is a legislative change and the government is not open to the possibility of amending the legislation, the fact that—as I understand the registration process under the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESOS" rel="nofollow">
             ESOS
            </a>
            Act—there is the capacity in the legislation for this extension to occur does not preclude the continuation of these negotiations prior to the registration being effected.

            <p>
             My advice is that the legislation that we will bring forward will fit the outcomes of the negotiations that we are undertaking at the moment. Instead of going through the process that is being proposed at the moment, we would rather complete the negotiations and put in place legislation that fits the negotiations we are currently undertaking.

                This amendment deals with the annual registration charge. I addressed this in my speech in the second reading debate. The opposition is moving this amendment in light of concerns raised by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee regarding some potential problems with the regime that is proposed in the legislation. We consider those concerns are worthy of support and, accordingly, I move this amendment, which is essentially a repeal of proposed section 23 and the substitution of a slightly amended regime.

                 The government does not support this amendment. We have had conversations with the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on this. There is an extensive process that providers go through in the lead-up to the payment of this annual registration charge. It is a self-assessed charge as part of the process. Consultation with the providers commences in November of the year previous to the date—that being 28 January. There is a process that provides for genuine consultation with the industry and one that provides plenty of opportunity for industry to understand what their costs and fees are likely to be and to interact with the agency and the government prior to paying the charge on 28 January as required by the proposed bill.
