        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Efficiency" rel="nofollow">
         Energy Efficiency

        . The minister will be aware that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Townsville City Council
        </a>
        in publicly published information have estimated that the financial impact of Labor's carbon tax will be, on average, an additional $68 per rateable property. Minister, given that this will result in either a loss of essential services or increased rates, what is the government's message to the people of Townsville and indeed other parts of Queensland who will be paying even more for their cost of living under Labor's toxic carbon tax?

        <p>
         What I would say is this: the government are providing very significant assistance through the tax system to Australian families because we do recognise the potential price impacts from a carbon price. I would also say that the fear campaign by those opposite regularly overstates that and regularly ignores the significant assistance that is to be provided.
        </p>
        <p>
         I make the point that we have made clear that we will be tripling the tax-free threshold, we will be increasing family tax benefits and we will be increasing pensions such as the age pension, none of which those opposite are matching. So let us remember that, whereas on our side of politics we do support a price on carbon, we also support proper assistance to Australian households through increasing the tax-free threshold—that is a tax break for all Australians earning under $80,000 a year—increases to the pension, increases to the disability support pension and increases to family tax benefit to deal with the price impacts of a carbon price.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite simply want to impose greater amounts of taxation on Australian households: $1,300 per year per household. They will do so in order to give that money to polluting companies in the hope that something might happen. Not only is it an example of an unfair policy; it is an example of a policy that will not work, that is economically inefficient.

          I will take the senator's interjection. It is an incompetent policy, because it is a policy that imposes costs on families, costs on households, for little or no environmental gain at very high cost. We have designed the carbon price very much recognising the importance of supporting Australian households. That is why you see the tax package associated with the Clean Energy Package.

               I apologise—against the government trying to provide small business with a tax cut. That is what the senator is saying. He is also saying 'tough' to the low-income workers who would benefit from the low-income super contribution, which he also opposed. It was 'tough' to small business where he opposed the instant asset write-off and other tax breaks. I am not surprised he does not want me to talk about this.

                     , with Mr Palmer lately or whether he has made this up all by himself. In terms of the support for industries which are highly emissions intensive, the senator would be aware that we are providing a very substantial amount of assistance in the form of free permits through the Jobs and Competitiveness Program for the most highly emissions intensive industries. They will get about 94½ per cent of their emissions covered by free permits under these programs at the outset. That substantially reduces their carbon liability to about $1.30 a tonne.
