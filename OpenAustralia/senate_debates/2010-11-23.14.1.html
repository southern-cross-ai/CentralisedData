        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Broadband and the

         Digital Economy

        , Senator Conroy. I refer to the services contract with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhill_Caliburn" rel="nofollow">
         Greenhill Caliburn
        </a>
        to advise on the ‘robustness of the key assumptions’—a euphemism if ever there was one—underlying the suppressed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        business case and the 2010-11 corporate plan. I refer also to the answers given by Senator Wong to Senator Cormann. If the government has so little confidence in its own business case that it has now called into question the very assumptions on which it is based, and if the Minister for Finance and Deregulation has so little confidence in the minister for broadband that she has now decided to second-guess his judgement, how can the public and the markets have any confidence in the minister?

         Unfortunately that question is based on a string of false premises, false assertions and some allegations tossed in just to round it out. The

          NBN
         </a>
         Co. has finalised its three-year corporate plan and its 30-year business plan. The company submitted the plan to the government, as I said yesterday, on 8 November 2010. The government has announced that it will be releasing as much information as possible from the business plan. The government is currently considering the business plan, and it is reviewing it to remove commercial-in-confidence material prior to its release. The government has also commissioned
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhill_Caliburn" rel="nofollow">
          Greenhill Caliburn
         </a>
         to undertake an external review of the NBN business plan, and it is common practice for government to seek external expert advice relating to complex policy transactions.

           If those opposite took the time to think of one original question other than what is on the front page of the
           <i>
            Australian
           </i>
           and asked if there was other external advice being sought on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
            National Broadband Network
           </a>
           , they might find out some other news as well. Ask just one original question that is not on the front page of the
           <i>
            Australian
           </i>
           and you might just learn something else. This occurred under the former Howard government, for example with the sale of Telstra. In recent times, external advice was sought for policies such as the Electricity Sector Adjustment Scheme and the Solar Flagships Program. Throughout the process of developing the National Broadband Network, the government has sought expert advice from a range of financial experts such as McKinsey and

                  , on a point of order: I asked the minister if he had read the service contract. He obviously has not even seen it. He obviously had it imposed upon him by Senator Wong. Can the minister address the question: has he read the contract?

                   There is no point of order. The minister is answering the question. The question was much broader than just that; that was part of the question. I cannot instruct the minister on how to answer the question, but I can draw the minister’s attention to the fact that there are 17 seconds remaining to answer the question.
