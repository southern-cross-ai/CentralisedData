        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care, Senator McKenzie. In last night's budget the Turnbull government cut funding for Commonwealth supported residential aged-care places in an attempt to address its blowout in the waitlist for in-home aged-care packages. How many Commonwealth supported residential aged-care places did the Turnbull government cut in last night's budget?

         I think the announcement last night around ageing in the budget was an incredibly positive one. It draws on the needs of Australians in this country, who, as they age, want greater choices. We are living longer, as we heard. We want to support Australians, as they live longer, to live fuller, more independent lives. What the findings and the research suggest, when I head out to the regions, is that Australians want to stay in their homes longer. So we need to ensure we have the relevant support packages ready and able to be used for them. We have record aged-care funding in the budget—an additional $5 billion over the next four years. That's the reality. So I know the opposition likes to make some rhetorical arguments around our lack of support here, but the facts speak for themselves. There is record funding into aged care—

          On a point of order, we have asked the minister a very simple question, which is: how many Commonwealth supported residential aged-care places did the Turnbull government cut in last night's budget? She's not addressing that question. She's talking about her own experience in regional Australia with aged care. It's a simple question. The minister should answer it.

             The point of order is direct relevance. It was a very simple question. I refer to Budget Paper No. 2 at page 117, which sets out the budget measure. We are asking how many Commonwealth funded residential places are reduced as a result of that budget measure?

               . I was going to answer the question after I'd actually outlined the measures within the package around choices. But given the need of the opposition to know the specifics, I am advised that greatly improved access to residential aged care with a growth 13,500 new aged-care places and 775 short-term restorative places as well as a $60 million capital investment are the specifics around the aged-care packages, bearing in mind that Australians are wanting to stay in their homes longer and we want to give them the support they need as they age.

                 I thank the minister for her answer but she needs to know, I think, that residential care is care that happens in residences, not the care that she's talking about. There are more than 100,000 older Australians still waiting for in-home care, with the waiting list growing by 20,000 older Australians in the last six months of 2017 alone. Can the minister confirm that the 14,000 aged-care packages funded over the next four years will not even keep up with demand?

                  I think I might need to correct Senator Watt's claims there in his question. Over 50 per cent of those on the national waiting list are actually in an aged-care package. They're waiting for another type of package. So I think to say there is a waiting list of 100,000 is actually incorrect. What the government should be focused on is ensuring that Australians, as they age, have the support to make the choices that they see fit for their lives. If they choose not to take up a residential aged-care package, but instead to use it for additional high-quality support to stay longer in their own home, then our government wants to support them to do that. That is their choice. The choice to not go into residential care but to have—

                    How is it fair that older Australians will be left waiting for years for a home care package when at the same time the Turnbull government can find $17 billion for the big banks? Is this the good budget for aged care the minister promised?

                     Yes, it is, Senator Watt. It is the budget for aged care and for ageing well here in Australia.

                         Yes! Sorry, Senator Watt, but living longer, you want to live well. That means being socially connected, being physically active, having the right support to make the financial decisions you need to ensure that you have a secure future and having the care you choose—whether you choose to have the type of package which includes meal preparation and assistance around the home with odd jobs, or whether you actually need further measures.
