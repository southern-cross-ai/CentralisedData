        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. Is the minister aware of whether the intergovernmental agreement on Tasman­ian forestry allows the possibility for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunns_Limited" rel="nofollow">
         Gunns Limited
        </a>
        to receive payment of taxpayer dollars for its purely voluntary decision to exit native forest logging opera­tions? Can the minister confirm whether the Common­wealth has received assurances from the Tasmanian government that Commonwealth funds will not be used for this purpose?

         I thank Senator Colbeck for the question. The historic intergovernmental agreement between the Australian and Tasmanian governments will secure jobs, ensure a sustainable forest industry and protect high-conservation-value forests for future generations. This agreement will help the forest industry adapt to market changes while protecting the communities and families who rely on the sector to survive. Under the agreement, a total of $276 million, including $15 million from the Tasmanian government, will be provided in the following key areas: support for workers, contractors and their families affected by the downturn in the industry; protecting high conservation value forests and ensuring a sustainable wood supply; and identifying and funding regional develop­ment and diversification projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian and Tasmanian govern­ments are immediately commencing imple­mentation of this agreement, including providing assistance to displaced workers and establishing an independent verification process under the intergovernmental agree­ment to assess timber supply requirements and the boundaries of proposed new conser­vation reserves. The industry support packages include $25 million for immediate employment and training support for redundant forestry workers; $15 million from the Tasmanian government to administer transition support payments to workers, including contractor employees; $45 million in assistance for voluntary exits from native forest operations, for haulage, harvest and silviculture contractors; and $1 million—

          , I raise a point of order. This information is well and truly known to us. It is in the intergovern­mental agreement and it is in the press releases from the Prime Minister. The question was about payment to Gunns from this process. It was a very specific question and that is the information that I am seeking. In the 41 seconds that the minister has spoken he has not gone anywhere near that particular question.

               , I raise a point of order. I have asked two very specific questions today relating to this process. Senator Conroy is really giving me a commentary on what is in the intergovern­mental agreement and what is in the Prime Minister's press release. I am quite capable of reading and under­standing those facts. I am after some specific facts. I asked some specific questions about payment to Gunns through this process and also about represen­tations received. I would ask you to bring the minister to the question.

                     made an independent decision to exit native forests. If there is any further information that I am able to get for the senator, I will see whether the minister is able to supply it.
