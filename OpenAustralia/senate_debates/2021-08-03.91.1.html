            You have reminded the minister of the question. I will take the opportunity that, while I won't judge direct relevance in 15 seconds when the minister is introducing her answer, I will remind the minister it was a very factual question and doesn't provide much room for commentary in order to be directly relevant.

                  , this was a factual question asking about programs, not rationale or commentary around the programs. The minister's entitled to list programs and be directly relevant or answer in a form that Senator Farrell would seek, but it's not a place for commentary around programs.

                   . I will go through the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements—the disaster resilience Australia package—where the minister is responsible for the measure but the decisions are delegated to the National Recovery and Resilience Agency. That's $2.1 million for this financial year. The disaster risk reduction package is a package to reduce the risk and impact of disasters on Australians, in line with our Disaster Risk Reduction Framework. It has co-funding, obviously, with the Australian and state and territory governments. Approval for these reports by the minister for emergency management and the National Recovery and Resilience Agency will trigger payments for 2021-22 to the states and territories in June 2022.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Then we have the Emergency Response Fund. This funding is actually to fund emergency response, natural disaster recovery and preparedness initiatives. That is also within the purview of the NRRA. Then we have the Black Summer Bushfire Recovery Grants program, a $280 million grant program over the next three years, which is actually to assist those communities that have been impacted by bushfires. The Minister for Emergency Management and National Recovery and Resilience—that would be me—is the decision-maker. The Local Economic Recovery Program—

                      There is the Local Economic Recovery Program. Whilst it is within my purview, the coordinator-general and state governments are the final decision-makers on that one. There are the restocking, replanting and on-farm infrastructure grants. The minister is only involved in a funding decision if there's a change in the national partnership agreement. Resilient kids—what a great program! Senator McDonald and I were able to announce $2 million for mental health support for schoolchildren who've been in flood affected communities. Those decisions are part of the national partnership agreement. There is $9 million over the next three years for economic diversification. Again, that is covered by the national partnership agreement, as are the telecommunications and energy improvement grants. Management of disaster risk, again, is under the national partnership agreement reallocation issues. The recovery and resilience grants—

                        If there are some other programs that the minister didn't get to answer, I'd be happy if she were to table the documents. I have a further question. How much budget allocation has been provided to the minister, discretionary or otherwise, in her new roles as Minister for Emergency Management and National Recovery and Resilience and the Minister for Regionalisation, Regional Communications and Regional Education?

                         I will have to get back to you with the totality of the budget allocations. Obviously, my last three weeks, as you can see from the brief time we've had to spend together outlining the programs that I'm responsible for and who makes decisions—I've got a lot more to go through, about which I'm happy to give you a private briefing, if that would assist you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         But I think the heart of your question, Senator, might actually been going to ministerial discretion in a Westminster democracy. As I've said on the public record, ministerial discretion is absolutely key to how our government functions. Ministers should take the advice and recommendations of departments and agencies and then exercise ministerial discretion appropriately, and my ministerial discretion, in other programs I've administered, resulted in a fairer outcome for Australian taxpayers.
