                   , I rise on a point of order. I know that Senator Conroy still does not quite believe that he is a cabinet minister after five years. However, Mr President, I would ask you on the point of relevance to direct him to the question. The question was about the Prime Minister's proposed visit to
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   . Can you ask the minister to address that question rather than to behave like the clown that he is.

                    Order! That is not called for. The minister was addressing the question until there was an unfortunate interjection which turned the minister's attention away from the question. I remind all senators that interjections are disorderly. There is a question before the Chair. The minister has one minute and 17 seconds. There is no point of order.
