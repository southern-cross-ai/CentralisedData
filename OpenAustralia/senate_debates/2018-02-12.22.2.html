        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. In October last year the minister declared, 'Safe, appropriate housing is crucial to better lives for residents in remote communities, including to improve health and education and address family violence.' Minister, has your government taken a decision to end the decade-long Commonwealth investment in remote Indigenous housing agreed in the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing? How will this impact upon Closing the Gap targets?

          Are you right? Cracker! Just let me get 'uh' out, if you could. Senator Dodson, I know you'll be listening to this, if none of the others on the other side are. No, we're not walking away from that at all, Senator Dodson. But one of the things you need to know, which I haven't had the opportunity to personally come round and explain yet, is that since Christmas we've been doing some calculations about why it is that the clear calculations we did about 10 years, which are about numbers—how many houses we need to invest in and predictions of population—haven't quite got there and we now need another little addition.
         </p>
         <p>
          There were a number of things that might have happened, but there's one thing we're most concerned with. I asked every state and territory jurisdiction: 'Is it a fact that you stopped building houses in the NPARIH area for 10 years? Is it a fact that you actually took the money away in the most racist possible process and policy that I can remember in this place?' In any event, I'm giving a new opportunity for the jurisdictions to come back about that.

          , Victoria and Tasmania have acknowledged that they're moving away from that; they're taking their own responsibilities under that. But they are in different circumstances. We had an independent review that showed the

            : the question Senator Dodson asked was whether the government had taken a decision to end the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing. It is a very important question and, whilst the minister may have a lot of political attack on the states that he wishes to engage in, we would ask that he answer that simple question.

              A national partnership involves every state and territory. It is self-evident that

               New South Wales
              </a>
              , Tasmania and Victoria are no longer in it. So now we're moving to a bipartisan approach. We've made the announcement with the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
               Northern Territory
              </a>
              and we're still in discussions with the other states and territories. But fundamental to this is ensuring that the states and territories are held to account, and those opposite should ensure that they are holding them to account in each of their jurisdictions.

                 Yes, he is. We have done an independent inquiry, which you would have a copy of, that shows what is required now, and our investment in the national partnership over a decade reduced the overcrowding significantly but we still have some work to do. So it's about that actual number, and we are negotiating, continuing to negotiate, with the states and territories about that number. But we now need the states and territories to transition to take on their own responsibilities of public housing, and we need to ensure that when the states and territories are allocating public housing—because, whether you're in
