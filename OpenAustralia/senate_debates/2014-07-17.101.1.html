        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. In the past fortnight, it has been announced that two mines have closed on the west coast of Tasmania. Two hundred jobs were gone overnight with 150 jobs to go next year. Why is it that the junior Assistant Minister for Employment, earlier this month, announced a $500,000 jobs initiative for Geelong and reinstated its local employment coordinator, but the senior Tasmanian Minister for Employment cannot do the same for the north-west coast and the west coast of Tasmania?

           , as you well know, coming from that region yourself, the state government quite rightly has developed a task force to look into the best possible way to deal with the situation on the West Coast. We can undertake the Labor method. The Labor method is: see a problem, throw a bucket of money over it and walk away without any responsibility, and simply say—

           We as a government will take a very considered approach as to how best to help the West Coast community of our home state. In relation to the workers: as I understand, a lot of them, in fact, live in Burnie and the north-west coast, driving in and out. There are also many workers that live in Queenstown, but they do have—

             , I rise on a point of order. I thought that, with that time, the minister might have got to my question, but he didn't. So my point of order is on direct relevance. The question was specifically about the extra money and the

                 say to the honourable senator: it is very bad form to quote your own media release that had that falsehood in it, claiming that the excellent member for Braddon had only suggested that people should be contacting Centrelink. The member for Braddon did a lot more, is doing a lot more, and has put to shame the pathetic efforts of the Labor Party who think that by issuing a media release they can just somehow overcome the situation—a media release which, might I add, suggested throwing, I think, $20 million at the situation, with projects that had not been through due diligence, projects that had not been considered as to their value for money—and, indeed, wanted to steal money from Peter to pay Paul that would have cost other Tasmanian jobs.
