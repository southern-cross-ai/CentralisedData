              You're quite right. I have just spoken to the Clerk and Deputy Clerk. The motion to suspend standing orders, I am told, needs to be relevant to the matter before the chair.

It will be up to the Labor Party whether they want to facilitate that happening.

                               I might assist the Senate: what I have just moved is that we bring on the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018 for concurrence immediately after the bill that we've just adjourned has been finally determined; that the routine of business from then on shall be this bill, the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018; that divisions may take place after 4.30; and that the Senate shall adjourn without debate after it has completed its consideration of both bills—the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 and the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018—or a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister.

I'm in the Clerk's hands as to how this circulated amendment may need to be amended.

                                    So the effect of this is: while we could've dealt with this legislation, particularly with regard to the legislation addressing the issue of kids and their families on Nauru, and had that dealt with by the House today, as a result of the tactics of both parties, we are now facing ramming through a guillotine of legislation that allows governments to spy on their citizens—effectively, to use their mobile phones as spying devices on Australian citizens? And we're not going to see any change over the Christmas period to the torture—the ongoing cruelty and brutality—of innocent people currently locked up in those offshore hellholes? I'm just seeking clarification: is that what's happened today,

                                      and Senator Hinch, who have sought to work on a cross-party basis to try and deal with an issue that Australians have wanted us to deal with, which is children on Nauru. I don't think anybody watching this would have doubted that the senators from those parties were working together, and nor would anyone have doubted the tactics from those opposite who knew they did not have the majority on the floor of the House of Representatives and have yet again used this Senate to prevent a message going back.

                                      It is the case that we do have a difference of views with the Australian Greens, and I suspect most of the crossbench, on the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill—I think that is a matter of record—but, insofar as Senator

                                      I think the Labor Party has sought, in tactic after tactic in this place, to try and facilitate that bill, and it is an indictment on the government and really a demonstration of their fragility that they would rather send the House home than ensure that either that bill was returned or, in fact, a national security bill, which is important ahead of Christmas for our agencies to have those capabilities, was returned. Senator Molan knows this, and he also knows that we had agreement around amendments. If the guillotine which I have moved were passed, the House would only have had to stay for a very short period after it has now adjourned. I really do want to say again: I think that is a real indictment that politics has come before national security for the coalition. That's how desperate they are.
