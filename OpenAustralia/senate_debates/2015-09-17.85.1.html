        My question is to the Minister for Human Services, Senator Payne. I refer the minister to the theft of Medicare clients' sensitive, personal information including bank account details. When did the minister become aware of the theft of Medicare clients' confidential, personal information which has been used by scammers to create fake bank accounts into which Medicare rebates are deposited?

           I raise a point of order on relevance. This is a very, very clear question with one aspect: when did the minister become aware of the theft. That is the question and the minister should be directed to go to that very important question of public policy.

              just deal with Senator Cameron's point of order first. In relation to Senator Cameron's point of order, I think it would be very unfair to say that the minister has not been directly relevant because she has not really had enough time. She has only been into her answer for a short period of time.

              Order! We need to give ministers some time to at least come to the question. In relation to the second point of order, I do not believe that was a reflection necessarily on Senator Cameron. I think Senator Payne was referring to facts that have occurred in the last 24 hours. However I will be listening fairly carefully to the answer. Minister.

               Police alerted the department on Thursday, 10 September that they had found a number of allegedly stolen medical files during an unrelated police operation. This is an ongoing police investigation, and ongoing police investigations must be allowed to take their appropriate course. The department is undertaking investigations as to any matters associated with inappropriate Medicare claiming. As is standard and responsible practice, the department does not comment on open or ongoing police investigations as this could potentially jeopardise their investigation. Observing this level of responsible behaviour has apparently escaped Senator Cameron.

                   . There were a number of matters in Senator Cameron's question to which I am responding. I would also note that Senator Cameron has said publicly that he has concerns about the comprising of Medicare/Medibank information and has indicated that Medicare information has been stolen. This is not the case. What has been stolen—

                     , this is a very important public policy matter. I asked the minister: when did she become aware of the theft. She has 13 seconds left, you have given her plenty of rope and she will not go to that question.

                       . As I was saying, a number of medical files have been stolen, allegedly, from medical practices in south-west Sydney. I want to make it very clear that they are medical files stolen from practices.

                              Senator Cameron, can I stop you there. The minister has been directly relevant to your question. She answered it completely up-front by saying she could not advise you. So I do not accept that there is a relevance issue in this case, I am sorry, Senator Cameron. The minister is in order.
