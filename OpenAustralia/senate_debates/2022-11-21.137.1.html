        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP" rel="nofollow">
         COP
        </a>
        27 telling the world that they are back, which begs the question: back from where exactly? This government has refused to commit to phasing out fossil fuels and continues to give billions of dollars to fossil fuel companies. Today, like every other day, the people in this place have the opportunity to stop billions of dollars being given to fossil fuel companies, particularly on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations

        lands to stop the destruction of land and sea country. My question is: when will this government actually commit to the global call to action by stopping public money to fossil fuel companies?

         Thank you to the senator for her question. She started her question by asking: from where are we back? We're back from the position—the illogical, irrational, ideological position—that was held by those opposite for so many years. After we lost government, as people would know, there was no action at home when it comes to certainty for the energy markets and there was a very clear view about how to behave internationally, which I do not believe is shared by most Australians and certainly is not shared by this side of the chamber, including the Greens. You asked about being back, and I'd make the point that we were represented by two ministers at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP" rel="nofollow">
          COP
         </a>
         , along with the assistant minister, Senator McAllister as well. I'm pleased to advise the senator that our increased ambition on climate and willingness to engage as a constructive and active global leader has been warmly welcomed by the international community, including the Pacific. We played a constructive leadership role at the COP, and we have made, as you know, climate change a priority.

             I understand, Senator, that the international narrative sometimes doesn't fit your domestic political objectives, but it doesn't. I want to tell you what Palau said. A member of the Pacific family singled out Australia for our help in delivering the loss and damage fund, saying, 'The tireless work by Australia and others reinforced our belief in multilateralism and our unwavering belief that we can solve global problems only by listening to each other and by working together.' This is Palau speaking.
            </p>
            <p>
             I understand you want to put a particular position because of your domestic political agenda, but we're actually interested in being part of the solution internationally. I'll come back and talk to you about what

               27 regarding the loss and damage climate fund, which will provide monetary support for countries hit hardest by the climate disasters caused by fossil fuels. Will the government commit to providing its fair share to the loss and damage fund, particularly to those here in Australia but also to the developing nations, especially our Pacific neighbours?

                  Wow, it's hard to know where to start, when we have the Pacific saying to us that they appreciate that we have contributed to the loss and damage fund becoming a reality in the multilateral system. We understand, of course, that loss and damage is about developed countries helping developing countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. It's obviously not about reparations or compensation. We contributed, respectfully, to the architecture—

                     I know Minister Regenvanu, and I respect him. I would make the point that that is not a demand that has been publicly made, nor even privately made to me in the discussions with many Pacific islands, around the conference of the parties that we want to co-host. We understand the position that the minister and other Pacific island nations have put forward. We understand that they have seen Australia over and over again, over the years, take a position on climate which did not reflect the reality of their lives. But we want to work with them. We want to elevate their voices and the real, lived experience of Pacific island nations because they have a powerful voice when it comes to climate—and so they should. As

                     told a Pacific gathering, 'We now have in Australia a government that is back on the front line of the fight against climate change, and I'd like us to cheer that now.' We're very grateful for that support.
