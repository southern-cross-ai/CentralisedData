          Social Security

         (Administration) Act 1999
        </i>
        to provide that consumer leases are excluded goods for the purposes of Part 3B of the Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill is needed to remove the potential for Centrelink clients to suffer financial harm as a result of entering into one or more consumer leases for household goods which are currently available for people using Centrepay.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor will not stand by while low-income, vulnerable Australians are exploited.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our system of social security should protect the poor and the vulnerable, not leave them open to financial exploitation by businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Centrepay is a free service through which Centrelink clients may pay recurring bills and other payments via debit from their welfare payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a valuable service when used appropriately but there is considerable and growing evidence that it is becoming a tool for financial services businesses to exploit low income and vulnerable Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consumer advocates and financial counsellors regularly encounter significant numbers of Centrelink clients under financial stress as a result of entering into one or more consumer leases for household goods.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Common household goods obtained under a consumer lease can cost up to seven times more than the usual retail price for the same goods.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example, a mid-range stroller retailing for $300 can cost up to $1330 if it is obtained under a consumer lease.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A basic washing machine retailing for around $450 can cost between $1100 and $1500 if it is obtained under a consumer lease.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And a child's cot retailing for $270 can cost up to $1550 if it is obtained under a consumer lease.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And at the end of the lease and after all that expense, the consumer does not own the goods.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The problem is widespread, but it is particularly acute in indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Consumer Action Law Centre, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Council
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        and Financial Counselling Australia have campaigned for some time to have consumer leases excluded from Centrepay because of the financial harm caused to financially vulnerable Centrelink clients.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Micah Law Centre observed in 2007 that consumer leases are not genuine leases, but "loans in lease clothing".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consumer leases are fringe credit products offered in the main to financially excluded consumers in the sub-prime end of the financial services market.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of the businesses offering consumer leases also operate in the payday lending market and similarly, cause significant financial harm to the most financially vulnerable people in the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is evidence that consumer leasing businesses are using the fact that they are approved Centrepay service providers as a
        <i>
         de facto
        </i>
        government endorsement of the product in their marketing materials.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will ensure that Centrepay is prospectively closed to consumer leasing companies, for the same reasons it is closed to payday lenders.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
