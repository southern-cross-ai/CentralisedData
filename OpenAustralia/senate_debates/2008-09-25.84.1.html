         Thank you for that question. In relation to the Forward with Fairness package, what this government did was to take forward the principles which would underpin the industrial relations system. Those principles that it took forward included those issues which underpinned the new workplace relations system: a Fair Work Australia institution as a one-stop shop and a strong and simple safety net for all Australian workers, including a minimum wage. In respect of the right to strike, the Forward with Fairness policy dealt with those issues in a clear way. What we do is to believe in the umpire’s decision in relation to these issues around industrial relations, unlike the Liberals, who believe in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         , who will not see what happened at the last election and who will not recognise that Work Choices is no longer relevant to the Australian ‘fair go all round’ principle.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we looked at was how we could ensure that there would be clear, tough rules for industrial action. Those clear, tough rules for industrial action would ensure that, in the Australian government’s new workplace relations system, industrial action will be governed by clear, tough rules. Those rules will ensure that protected industrial action will only be available during collective bargaining if it has been approved by a majority of employees in a mandatory secret ballot. Of course, employees and/or their bargaining representatives will be required to provide to their employer, within three working days, written notice of their intention to take—

              It seems that those opposite have closed their minds to what I have been talking about. They are in fact not listening to the issue that I am actually going to, which is when you can take protected industrial action under our, fair system—unlike

              , where the Liberals opposite subscribed to a system that ensured it would strip wages and conditions from employees. What the Rudd government is delivering is a fair industrial relations system which will ensure that the contents of agreements will be able to include matters pertaining to the relationship between (a) the employer and the employees, and (b) the employer and any union to be covered by the agreement—and the expression ‘matters pertaining to the employment relationship’ has been used for over a hundred years and brings with it established legal principles. Those established legal principles will ensure that the content that can be bargained off will then be a matter for the parties to the agreement to bargain over. It will also be a matter that that content will ensure that issues within what has been established over a hundred years—

                 What those opposite have failed to understand—in fact, failed to listen to—is that we are talking about an industrial relations system that ensures that people can take protected industrial action and can bargain for an enterprise agreement, and the content of that agreement, as I have been saying, allows them to deal with matters pertaining to the employee-employer relationship and the other matters that I also went to. That ensures that the parties can then determine the content of the agreement and, if they want to bargain over issues that it contains, then they can in fact bargain on those matters. What the opposition subscribed to is a system which ensures that there is not fair bargaining, that employees cannot take protected industrial action—

Unprotected industrial action, like snap strikes, will not be tolerated. Those issues—

                        Yes, on relevance. Given that the minister did not want to answer the actual question posed to him and went everywhere through Forward with Fairness but could not stumble across what is actually in Forward with Fairness, which says that they will not allow such action; they specifically rule it out—and the blood is draining from Senator Ludwig’s face, as it should—

                              I am ruling on the point of order. You can take a further point of order in a moment. At this stage the minister has 17 seconds left and must remain relevant to the question. Now, Senator Faulkner.

                               , my further point of order is that, on this occasion, Senator Abetz sought the call from you, did not identify the fact that he was taking a point of order and received the call and, with respect—
