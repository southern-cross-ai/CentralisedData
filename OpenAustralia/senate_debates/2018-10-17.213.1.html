           All jurisdictions are responsible for keeping women and children safe. The government has spent well in excess of $300 million on women's safety since 2015. We are focused on practical measures that reduce the incidence of violence and, when it occurs, support victims and their children. I note that the government currently has legislation in the parliament to enshrine the Fair Work Commission decision of a minimum standard of five days of unpaid domestic violence leave.
