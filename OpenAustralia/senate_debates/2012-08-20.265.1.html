        <p>
         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)   (a) Yes,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Post
         </a>
         followed the process as outlined by Ms Corbett.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) (i) By counselling, Australia Post understands this to mean did it seek to identify whether the matters of concern were training and/ or relationship related and take steps to resolve these directly with the licensee.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Yes, Australia Post took steps to identify the causes of the matters of concern and worked directly with the licensees in an effort to resolve these issues over an extended period of time.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii) Yes, Australia Post sought to mediate on the matters of concern with the licensees through the dispute resolution processes of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPO" rel="nofollow">
          LPO
         </a>
         Agreement and/ or the Franchising Code of Conduct.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In both cases the licensees declined to participate in the dispute resolution process.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (iii) By consultation, Australia Post understands this to mean did it maintain ongoing communications with the licensees on the matters of concern.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Yes, Australia Post ensured that it maintained ongoing communication with the licensees as part of its efforts to resolve the matters of concern with them.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) In both cases Australia Post hand delivered to the licensees the formal notice of termination of the LPO Agreement. The notice provided a date of effect 90 days from issue.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The licensees were able to engage in mediation with Australia Post regarding the decision to terminate the LPO Agreement through the formal dispute resolution processes provided under both the LPO Agreement and the Franchising Code of Conduct.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Australia Post understands this question to refer to the dispute resolution process available to licensees under the LPO Agreement. A dispute resolution process is also separately provided under the Franchising Code of Conduct.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The dispute resolution process provided under the LPO Agreement is a tiered process allowing for matters to be progressed from a local level to a formal dispute resolution committee in the event that they cannot be resolved. The dispute resolution committee comprises an independent chairperson (typically chosen from nominees provided by the Institute of Arbitrators and Mediators of Australia) and a representative from the Post Office Agents Association Limited and Australia Post.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The committee will endeavour to assist the licensee and Australia Post to find a resolution to the matter in dispute which is suitable to both parties. In the event that an agreement on resolving the dispute cannot be reached, both parties maintain their rights to pursue other options including legal action.
