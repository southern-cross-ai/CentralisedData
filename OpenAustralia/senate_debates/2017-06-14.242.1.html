        My question is to Minister Cash, representing the immigration minister. Minister, I refer you to the immigration minister's decision to settle a class action based on the illegal detention and failure of duty of care brought by 1,905
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Manus Island
        </a>
        detainees—people who have suffered a shocking loss of their freedoms, who have had their families torn apart and who have lost all hope for the future because of decisions taken by you and your government and your Labor predecessors. People have died, been seriously injured, come under machine gun fire and suffered permanent harm because of choices made by the Labor and Liberal Parties. Isn't today's settlement an admission that you are responsible for the ongoing harm of the detainees on Manus Island and Nauru?

        </p>
        <p>
         It is opportune, though, given that Senator McKim has given me the opportunity to do this, to remind the Australian people of exactly why today's settlement occurred and the events that actually brought it into play. Senator McKim, let me tell you exactly. When the former Howard government lost office in 2007, do you know how many people there were in detention? Colleagues, would you like to have a guess? Less than a handful, Senator McKim. Do you know what the detention network—

On this side of the chamber, we take responsible action in relation to these matters. But again, Senator McKim referred to facts. Senator McKim, these are the facts—about which you, like an ostrich, buried your head and the Australian Greens heads in the sand—there were four people in detention in 2007 when the
