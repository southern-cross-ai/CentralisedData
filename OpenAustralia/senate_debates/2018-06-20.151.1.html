        (b) acknowledges the citation for the award, which states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On the 15th and 16th of December 2014 Mr Tori Johnson displayed conspicuous courage during an armed siege at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At approximately 8am on 15 December 2014, an armed gunman entered the Lindt Cafe and took 18 people hostage. The gunman directed Mr Johnson, the manager of the Lindt Cafe, to call 000 and say that all those in the cafe had been taken hostage by a man who was armed with a shotgun and explosives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The gunman instructed for the cafe's doors to be locked, as the ten patrons and eight staff became aware of their predicament. In response to the 000 call, police immediately cleared and secured the area around the cafe.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over the ensuing 16 and a half hours Mr Johnson instigated and maintained a rapport with the offender, pacifying him on many occasions without thought for his own safety. He relayed information to police and negotiators in a calm and rational manner which helped reassure the other hostages.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Johnson, whilst knowing the layout and exits of the cafe, chose not to take the opportunity to escape. He specifically remained with an elderly, less mobile, hostage even when she requested he leave without her when an opportunity to escape arose. As the situation inside the cafe deteriorated Mr Johnson was directly threatened.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Without regard for his own safety he continued to calmly obey the gunman's demands in an attempt to protect the other hostages.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At approximately 2 am Mr Johnson was placed in a kneeling position in front of the gunman—who fired and fatally wounded Mr Johnson. At this point tactical police raided the cafe which resulted in the death of the gunman.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By his actions, Mr Johnson displayed conspicuous courage.
