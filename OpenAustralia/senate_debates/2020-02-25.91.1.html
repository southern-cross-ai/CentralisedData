        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. Can the minister outline the Morrison government's actions to create a stronger and more resilient Australia through our record investment in aged care?

         I thank Senator Smith for his question and for his long interest in aged care, which we have discussed many times. This government is committed to improving the aged-care sector in Australia, and we have delivered unprecedented investment into aged care. This year, 2019-20, our investment will be $21.4 million into the aged-care sector—funding that goes towards some of this government's most important priorities. We have provided 44,000 additional home care packages in the last two years alone. That's an additional investment of $2.7 billion. We can do that, because we've managed the budget well and we have the capacity to make these investments. When we came to government there were just over 60,000 home-care packages in the market. That will go to 158,000 in 2022-23, an increase of over 160 per cent. Our government is supporting 1.3 million Australians in some form of aged care across the system.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our determination to ensure that we have the best aged-care system possible is demonstrated by our calling of the royal commission—one of Prime Minister Morrison's first acts when coming to government—so that we could have the best overview of the system. We've put in place the new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. We appreciate the opposition supporting the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission legislation that went through the parliament just prior to Christmas.

            Those sitting on the opposite side might think that this is not something of note. Our announcement on 31 January of almost $50 million towards the Business Improvement Fund demonstrates our desire to ensure that aged-care providers across Australia are supported when they get into difficulty. We already have in place a business assessment service. The new Business Improvement Fund provides support to aged-care providers from all over Australia who qualify. It helps them implement strategies to improve their delivery of aged care to senior Australians. This government remains determined to ensure that the care provided to senior Australians across the nation is the best it possibly can be.

               Senators opposite don't seem to really care about the importance of aged care to Australians. They went to the last election with $387 billion worth of new taxes and not one single new home-care package, not a cent for the workforce and not a cent for mainstream residential care. Providing safe quality care is important. As I said before, we do appreciate the support that the opposition gave to us in legislating to bring all the functions of quality care into one service under the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. It was an important reform that was recommended by the Carnell-Paterson review. Those regulatory powers give senior Australians the capacity to go to one agency now in respect of all the issues that relate to their aged care.
