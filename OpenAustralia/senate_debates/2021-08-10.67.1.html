        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Reports indicate that Mr Morrison will pursue 'freedom incentives', and Mr Morrison has said that Australians who have a vaccine will have vaccine certificates by October this year. Does this minister support vaccine certificates, and does he support the certificates being mandatory for air travel within Australia and overseas?

         I thank Senator O'Neill for her question. There are a few things that are relevant to that question. It is important that Australians be in a position to provide a form of proof of vaccination. The importance of that is likely to be the case for a number of reasons, not just medical reasons. That's why the government has been working in terms of the technology to enable people to download their vaccine certificate—as part of their Apple Wallet technology platforms, for example. It's also why work is underway for high-security proof-of-vaccination linkage to passport-type documents for international travel. A number of countries of the world have made it clear already that vaccination may be an important part of, or a requirement for, entry to their nations in the future. So Australians will likely need and require that sort of technology and support to be able to demonstrate proof of vaccination as part of their travels and their engagements.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of requirements in relation to vaccination in Australia and for domestic travel, some airlines themselves have indicated that they expect this to be a requirement for travel. Those are, at this stage, commercial decisions. Governments have made certain decisions in relation to certain workforces, especially those such as aged-care sectors, where public health orders could be used in relation to vaccination. Once again, having effective proof of vaccination may well be a relevant consideration for people in those workforce environments and also perhaps for those visiting aged-care facilities or the like in the future, which is why having such technology available is important.

           Senator Canavan has declared: 'I'm deadset against any vaccine passports. I know many of my Nationals colleagues will not be supporting any kind of rollout of vaccine passports in this country.' Does this minister agree with Senator Canavan?

            I'll let Senator Canavan speak for himself, particularly in relation to the fact that I think you would find that there is some distinction between what some may declare vaccine passports to be—or some extension that some may make to what they believe vaccine passports could be used for—and what the reality may end up being in terms of how they are applied or used. I would hope that all Australians understand, in terms of the way I have explained the likely need for technology platforms that can provide proof of vaccination, that it is a sensible thing for people to have—to, as I said, facilitate their ability to travel internationally in the future in what are likely to be changed circumstances and their ability to work in sectors where there are requirements for vaccination or to meet other potential public health requirements that states or territories may impose to continue to successfully manage COVID-19.

              When discussing vaccine certificates, Liberal Senator Alex Antic said, 'The Nuremberg Code arises in the ashes of World War

               II

              , where I suppose there were medical procedures being done on people against their will, and, you know, it's a very, very slippery slope that we get into if we start doing this.' Does this minister agree with Senator Antic?

               I can't say that I'd heard that quote until the senator used it. Thank you, Senator O'Neill. I want to emphasise—because the quote suggests, perhaps, a misunderstanding that there's going to be some compulsion for people to have a vaccine—that the government's always been very clear that Australians will face a choice in relation to getting vaccinated. We do urge all Australians to exercise that choice. I'm very pleased that some 234,899 Australians turned out yesterday as part of the vaccination program, pushing the number of vaccine doses administered to some 13.958 million across Australia. That is a demonstration of the momentum that is building across the rollout, which has now seen 44.7 per cent of those aged over 16 receive at least their first dose.
