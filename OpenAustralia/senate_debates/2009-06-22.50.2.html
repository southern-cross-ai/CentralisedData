           s agree on common terminology for referring to organisations within the Sector. Governments should also develop a common meaning for terms referring to the size of these organisations, including ‘micro’, ‘small’, ‘medium’ and ‘large’. This standard terminology should be adopted by all government departments.

           Agree in principle. The Commonwealth Government recognises the broad range of organisations that make up the third sector and the lack of clear terminology, particularly when various tax concessions are available. Common definitions and terminology will help to build a consistent view of the third sector and its operation within Australia.  The results of the

           The committee recommends that a new disclosure regime contain elements of narrative and numeric reporting as well as financial, in acknowledgement that the stakeholders of the Sector want different information to that of shareholders in the Business Sector. The financial reporting should be transparent and facilitate comparison across charities.

           Noted. The Commonwealth Government will consider the recommendations of the Senate Inquiry throughout 2009, as findings of various reviews are reported. It will consult extensively across the third sector, business community and State and Territory Governments. It will also seek expert advice as required. The appropriate mechanism for consultation will be determined as the issues are considered.
