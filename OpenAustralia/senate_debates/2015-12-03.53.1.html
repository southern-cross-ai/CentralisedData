         I thank Senator Reynolds for her question, because her question goes to the heart of how it is that Australia can contribute and will contribute to achieving a cleaner environment through such investment and commitment to innovation and technology and to doing so as part of strong global agreements. Australia, at present, has been in Paris negotiating for a truly global climate agreement and one that will drive inventiveness and new technologies to help ensure that we do deliver a cleaner climate and environment in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Paris, the Prime Minister announced that we will ratify the second commitment period of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" rel="nofollow">
          Kyoto Protocol
         </a>
         . Our Kyoto target will be completely consistent with our 2020 targets of minus five per cent on 2000 levels by 2020. Ratification will not change Australia's targets, obligations or domestic policies but will affirm what we have agreed and is consistent with what we are doing. Australia, of course, beat the first Kyoto target, and we are on track to meet and beat our second. Australia is a country that does and delivers on what it promises in these global agreements, and we will do so, absolutely, again.
        </p>
        <p>
         During discussions in Paris we have reconfirmed our commitment to the 2030 reductions target of between 26 and 28 per cent, which will halve Australia's per capita emissions, and it is one of the largest reductions of any G20 country. Unlike Labor's failed carbon tax, our climate change policies are working and will help to drive innovation and inventiveness. That is why Australia has joined the Mission Innovation program, which aims to double clean energy technology investment over the next five years. We know that policies that drive innovation will result in and deliver a cleaner environment for Australia and the world.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister also inform the Senate what practical initiatives the government is undertaking to ensure Australia continues to lead the way internationally in reducing our emissions by supporting innovation and new technologies?

           The Turnbull government is delivering on the Emissions Reduction Fund and the auctions under that fund, which are genuinely reducing emissions in Australia. The first two Emissions Reduction Fund auctions secured nearly 93 million tonnes of emissions reductions, at an average price of $13.12 per tonne. This is vastly more efficient and effective than anything that was achieved under Labor's carbon tax. This includes 35 bushfire prevention projects in our northern savannas, which will reduce emissions by nearly seven million tonnes from those projects alone. Australian researchers have demonstrated that they are at the forefront of energy and climate innovation. For example, by 2018 our researchers will develop the technology that is applying in over 60 per cent of the world's solar cells. We are also supporting the French '4 per 1000' soils for food security and climate initiative, because we recognise all that can be achieved from soil carbon efficiency.

             Sadly, I am. Despite the success we are having with the Emissions Reduction Fund delivering reductions in emissions at an average price of $13.12 per tonne, those opposite are committed to bringing back a carbon tax, and the targets that Mr Shorten has been talking about, of 45 per cent, would see a carbon tax running in the range of $209 per tonne. That is $209 per tonne for their tax on electricity, compared with emissions reductions being delivered under our policies at around $13 per tonne. That is the difference. Those opposite just want a tax on electricity. We actually want to see effective delivery of emissions reductions at the lowest possible price. The lowest possible price we are delivering at $13 per tonne versus their $209 per tonne tax on all Australian businesses, households and investment, which can only harm the Australian economy, without delivering the types of effective emissions reductions our government is delivering.
