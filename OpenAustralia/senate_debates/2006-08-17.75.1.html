         I thank the effervescent Senator Lightfoot for his question and I note his ongoing interest and longstanding commitment to ensuring that Australians have a place in which to work so that they can have more job opportunities and enjoy higher wages.

        <p>
         I am pleased to report to the Senate that, according to the

         , the take-home pay of Australian workers rose by 4.1 per cent in the past year—that is, at a rate above the annual inflation rate. In other words, wages are still increasing in real terms. More tellingly—and those on the other side might want to listen to this—in the June quarter, wages of Australian workers grew by an average of 1.1 per cent. That is, during the months of April, May and June, the wages of workers grew by 1.1 per cent. That figure is of more than usual interest to the people of Australia. Guess when

                    None other than Senator Gavin Marshall said that. How wrong he was. But, even better: ‘... these changes are going to have a catastrophic effect on the wages of Australian workers’—that was none other than

                    , workers would face mass sackings. Instead of employment going down, it has gone up—159,000 extra workers. We were told that wages would be driven down; in fact, they are being driven up. So can I suggest to those opposite that they should discard their silly policy of ripping up Work Choices, because if they seek to rip up Work Choices they will be ripping up the 159,000 extra jobs that have been created; they will be ripping up the real wage increases that workers of Australia are now enjoying across the board, over the last quarter. I say this to Mr Beazley and the Labor Party—a bit of gratuitous advice: if you keep on with this silly policy of ripping up Work Choices, Mr Beazley will rip up any chance that he ever had of becoming Prime Minister of this great nation.
