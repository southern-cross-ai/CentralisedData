         Order on my left. Can we allow the minister to get to her feet before the interjections start? I prefer them to be able to stand before the interjections start, at least on Mondays.

          I thank Senator Molan for his question. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate was saying, 2017 was a great year for job creation in Australia. In excess of 403,000 jobs were created. Three-quarters of those jobs were full-time jobs. So the economy is creating jobs based on the sound policies of the Turnbull government.
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Molan, you are correct: what we also do as a government is ensure that we have policies in place that will get those who are on welfare off welfare and into work, because on this side of the chamber we are very, very proud that we believe that the best form of welfare is a job. We will put in place the policies that will give people the skills and the experience that they need to move from welfare and into work.
         </p>
         <p>
          In relation to what Work for the Dole does, many of the people working on Work for the Dole have very, very limited experience. In fact, some of them have never, ever set foot into a workplace. Some of them have never seen their parents set foot into the workplace. Work for the Dole gives people the skills, experience and confidence they need to move from welfare and into work whilst giving back to their community. A monitoring survey that was done last year found that 74 per cent of participants reported an increase in their desire to find a job, 70 per cent said it had increased their ability to communicate and work with others and their self-confidence, and 68 per cent said it had helped them find work. These are people who, but for the opportunities presented by the Turnbull government's policies, would be looking at a life on welfare, and that's not fair.

             Yes, I can, because there are numerous Work for the Dole activities helping local communities. For example, charities, not-for-profits and other community groups get an extra pair of hands, with people doing valuable community work they could not otherwise do. Since the start of the program almost 38,000 activities have been undertaken, with approximately 6,500 activities in operation today. For example, participants assisted with the maintenance and landscaping of the Whyalla Men's Shed, including building fencing and a pergola. The participants learned valuable skills in painting, paving, woodworking and gardening. Three months after leaving the activity, three out of the eight participants were in paid work. That's a program getting people off welfare and into work.

                I don't think it will surprise you when I say, 'Yes, those opposite.' The biggest threat to the government's successful Work for the Dole program is those opposite. Labor wants to consign valuable Australians to a life of welfare. This was recently confirmed by the shadow minister,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Husic" rel="nofollow">
                 Ed Husic
                </a>
                , when he refused to guarantee that Work for the Dole would continue under a Shorten government, if one were ever elected. The Turnbull government are committed to getting people off welfare and into work. As we all know, the best form of a welfare is a job. Mr Shorten needs to confirm to the Australian people that he supports Work for the Dole, and getting people off welfare and into work. Those of us on this side of the chamber will always support work over welfare.
