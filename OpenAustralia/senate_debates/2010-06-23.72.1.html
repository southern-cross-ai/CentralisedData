        , Senator Conroy. Given that in just one week the analog television signal in the Mildura-Sunraysia region will be permanently switched off, making that region the first in Australia to switch to digital-only television under the government’s switch-over timetable, can the minister assure the Senate that the people of Mildura are ready for this historic event?

         I am delighted to report that Mildura-Sunraysia is absolutely ready to switch to digital-only television in one week from today. At 9 am next Wednesday, 30 June, I will be in Mildura when we turn off the analog television signal forever. The people of Mildura have, in the space of a couple of years, moved from having some of the worst television reception and the most limited choice of channels in the country to leading Australia in the move to 16 or more channels of clear pictures and crisp sound. Virtually 100 per cent of the households in Mildura are digital ready, according to the government’s digital tracker survey. Over 2,300 households have been helped to convert to digital

         under the government’s household assistance scheme. Broadcasters have also played their part, installing three new transmitters to serve known black spots in Ouyen, Underbool and Robinvale. Local antenna installer Rohan Gregg has described the new Ouyen transmitter as ‘one of the best things we’ve had happen since the great Australian vanilla slice’.

         The government has launched a new satellite service to serve viewers in remote Australia and regional black spots. This service is known as viewer access satellite television, or

           The government funded satellite service finally provides viewers in remote Australia and regional black spots with the same number of digital channels as are available in the capital cities. It also features a dedicated local news service. This is the first time local news has been available to satellite viewers in regional and remote Australia. The new satellite service is on air in the Mildura-Sunraysia region now and is being warmly received. Patchewollock resident Terry Torney told the

             I thank Senator Marshall for his ongoing interest in the good people of Victoria. The Rudd government is committed to building the infrastructure that will underpin the development of the digital economy. The switch to digital-only television is a crucial measure to support this objective. Spectrum currently used for broadcasting services is highly valued for delivering wireless communications services, including superfast mobile broadband. It is able to carry signals over long distances, penetrate buildings and carry large amounts of data. Once analog television signals have been completely switched off and the spectrum is subsequently cleared of other users, that spectrum will be released as a digital dividend. And releasing the digital dividend is a historic microeconomic reform. It presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve communications services in Australia. The Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association has estimated a $10 million bonanza for the Australian economy—
