        I rise to speak about Parkinson's disease, a progressive disease that affects movement and mood. While many of us have heard of Parkinson's disease and might know some of the symptoms, general awareness of this condition grew dramatically when actor

        was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's at just 29 years of age. As a co-chair of Parliamentary Friends of Parkinson's, together with Senator Bilyk, I have met many people diagnosed with Parkinson's and heard their stories as they struggle to understand the changes in their lives and bodies. I also have some very dear friends with this condition.

        I am pleased to advise that there have been recent developments in our understanding of this condition and also how Australian Parkinson's patients can be better supported. Two of those developments are the formation of the national Parkinson's alliance and the upcoming Australian summit to end Parkinson's, which will be held here in this building next Tuesday. The national Parkinson's Alliance membership includes Fight Parkinson's, in Victoria;

        ; and Wings for Parkinson's Tasmania. This collection of organisations and individuals from the Australian Parkinson's community has been working hard to develop a national Parkinson's action plan that will help shape future research, policy and care pathways for Australians living with the disease. The Australian summit to end Parkinson's is one of the first steps in forming the action plan, and I look forward to participating in the summit. I also look forward to joining Senator Bilyk at the event, as we host Australia's Governor-General, His Excellency General the Hon.
