         I thank Senator Duniam for his question. I can advise the Senate that today the jobs figures came out for August 2016. The unemployment rate in Australia declined by 0.1 percentage points over the month to 5.6 per cent in August 2016. This is the lowest rate recorded since September 2013, and it is 0.5 percentage points below the 6.1 per cent recorded a year earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to job creation under the coalition government, since the coalition came to office in 2013 around half a million jobs have been created, with employment now standing at 11,963,700 in August 2016. Under this government employment has continued to grow, rising by 1.5 per cent over the last year. In the last 12 months, the economy and business has created approximately 180,000 jobs, compared to the last 12 months of the former Labor government, in which the economy created approximately 86,000 jobs. The government does not underestimate the critical task of creating more job opportunities for Australians. That is why we are focused on the task at hand, to help give job seekers the dignity of work. On this side of the chamber we believe that the best form of welfare is a job.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the comparison with those opposite, it is very clear that Labor, implementing the policies that it did, failed Australians and, in particular, failed employers. Under the six years of Labor, the jobless queues grew by around 200,000 people. On this side of the chamber we have a strong plan that is focused on growing our economy and creating jobs.

            On this side of the chamber we understand that governments themselves do not create jobs—employers do. We need to ensure that we have the right policy framework in place so that the economy grows, businesses grow and ultimately the economy and business are able to create more jobs. That is why this government took to the 2016 election a policy that was all about jobs and growth—for example, the investment that we have in infrastructure and roads and a $200 million investment for regional Australia to diversify local economies, create local jobs and grow skills in the local workforce. It is why we have pursued the signing of free trade agreements—free trade agreements that those on the other side were unable to sign up to when they were in government. It is why we have legislation before this parliament to restore law and order to the building and construction sector, our third largest industry, employing one in 10 Australians.

               As I said, on this side of the chamber we understand that you need to put in place the right policy framework so that the economy grows and business is able to prosper and create more jobs. It is fundamentally different to those opposite. All they have for the Australian people is a plan for higher debt—they openly admitted that prior to the election—higher taxes and more regulation. If you look at the period in which the current Leader of the Opposition was the workplace relations minister, the number of unemployed people increased by around 72,000. In trend terms, from November 2007 to the end of Labor's time in office 128,800 manufacturing jobs, around one in eight, disappeared completely. In terms of policies that stifled growth, there was the carbon tax; and what about the mining tax? On this side of the chamber we understand that you need the right policy framework.
