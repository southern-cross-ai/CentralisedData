        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Is the minister aware that this weekend marks five years in custody without trial or conviction for Australian man Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hicks" rel="nofollow">

        ? Can the minister explain why the Prime Minister has been so callous as to let an Australian rot in a foreign jail without trial for half of the life of his government? Now that coalition backbenchers have joined the calls of every state and territory Attorney-General, the

        Attorney-General, the UK Lord Chancellor, a former High Court judge and many other eminent Australians, will the government ask the United States to release Mr Hicks into Australian custody so that he can be dealt with under our laws?

         This is a matter which, of course, the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have been working on assiduously for some time. They have been making strong representations to the United States and telling the United States that Australia believes that this man should be brought to trial as soon as possible. I understand that the Attorney-General in a recent visit to the United States conveyed that sentiment personally to the Attorney-General of the United States. I also understand that the Attorney-General met with

         , recently in Adelaide and discussed the situation with him. The family raised a number of issues with the Attorney-General. He sought advice on the conditions of Mr Hicks’s detention from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         authorities as a result of that and that is being pursued.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout all of this, going back to when I visited Washington some years ago, we have made it very clear to the United States that this man should be brought to trial. He was charged and as a result of an appeal, Hamdan v Rumsfeld, those proceedings were stayed. The consequential decision in Hamdan v Rumsfeld necessitated a change in the regulations to the military commission that is dealing with Mr Hicks. We understand that Mr Hicks will be charged under these new arrangements and we have indicated in the strongest possible terms that all of the safeguards and concessions that we obtained previously will be applied and we received those assurances.

            The counterterrorism laws that we have in Australia today were not in place at the time of the alleged activities of Mr Hicks. We have made it very clear that, if he were to be returned to Australia, he could not be tried accordingly. We have treated this matter seriously. I reject totally that the Prime Minister has been callous in his approach. I reiterate that the Attorney-General met with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hicks" rel="nofollow">

            ’s father recently. On, I think, some 17 occasions, Australian officials have visited Mr Hicks. In relation to his welfare, there have been two formal investigations carried out by United States authorities and, of course, we will continue to address any request for assistance from his counsel. Major Mori was here in Australia recently, we understand in relation to the conduct of Mr Hicks’s defence, and we stand ready to assist should a mutual assistance request be made to us in relation to any evidence that is sought.

               David Hicks

              over there in custody without trial forever. That is totally untrue. We are making it very clear that Australia believes that this man should be brought to trial and we are saying to the United States that that should be done as soon as possible. He has been there for a lengthy period of time. There have been court proceedings which have necessitated a delay in the proceedings of the charges. He was previously charged on three serious counts in relation to his alleged activities and we believe that the military commission is an appropriate way to deal with him, but he should be brought to trial as soon as possible.
