       <p>
        Tonight I stand to show support and solidarity for the 60th anniversary of the state of Israel. Last week, the House of Representatives celebrated the 60th anniversary of the state of Israel. Indeed, it has been 60 years of good relations between Australia and modern-day Israel, as well as our prior alliance when Australian troops fought in the region against the Ottomans during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . I would like to express my support for the motion that was passed overwhelmingly in the House last week, on 12 March, although I note the 60-year anniversary of Israel is 14 March.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion supported by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the opposition leader,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Nelson" rel="nofollow">

          reiterate Australia’s commitment to the pursuit of peace and stability throughout the

         <dd>
          on this, the 60th Anniversary of Independence of the State of Israel, pledge our friendship, commitment and enduring support to the people of Israel as we celebrate this important occasion together.
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend wholeheartedly my support for that motion. Australia does, as it should, recognise Israel’s existence, but in addition it supports the valid objectives of the Palestinian people, therefore supporting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian tensions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia and Israel are both relatively young nations, with the common ideals of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of religion. Australia was in fact the first country to vote in favour of the 1947
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        partition resolution, as well noted in the House of Representatives resolution. Australia and Israel have strong trade links, with major Australian exports to Israel being coal, live animals, pearls and gems. All in all, two-way trade with the state of Israel is estimated at $828 million per annum. Australia and Israel are both the countries of choice for a large number of immigrants seeking a better life. Both our countries reward hard work and acknowledge that economic development is the best defence in the fight against poverty. Both Australia and Israel understand that occasionally we are required to fight for the freedoms which we hold dear.

              Brigade, or the battle of Beersheba, was a significant Australian military event, often described as ‘the last successful cavalry charge in British military history’. The battle involved 800 soldiers of the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade under Brigadier General William Grant. They charged with only horses, rifles and bayonets into the Turkish trenches, overrunning them and capturing the wells of Beersheba. Brigadier General William Grant, originally from Stawell in Victoria, transferred to command the 4th Light Horse Brigade on the eve of the battle. The next day, the Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Edmund Allenby, personally decorated Grant with a bar to his

             <p>
              The daring and the action of the Australian light-horsemen was vital not only in the supply of water for the Allied forces and troops but for turning around the whole Turkish flank in Palestine. The goal of our British partners was to drive the Turks north from Gaza, and it was an inspirational victory. The events at Beersheba were an inspiration for the 1987 Australian film

              I noted an opinion piece by Israel’s ambassador to Australia,

              newspaper this past weekend, where he said that:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Since achieving independence in 1948, Israel has risen from the horror and anguish of the Holocaust to be a vibrant, democratic nation fuelled by values of justice and the rule of law.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              …            …            …
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Israel’s founding fathers transformed a desert into the source of a viable agricultural industry, underpinning the dynamic Israeli economy. Israel thrived with the influx of Jewish refugees and survivors of the Holocaust, arriving from 100 countries and speaking 82 languages.

              The
              <i>
               Australian
              </i>
              editorial on 12 March also noted the concerns that they had. The editorial reads:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              We reject the view that the Israeli conflict lies at the root of all the problems in the Middle East and is the trigger for the rise of al-Qa’ida and, by extension, terrorist acts such as the 9/11 bombings.
             </p>
             <p>
              The editor concludes by saying:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Against remarkable odds, Israel has prospered greatly over the past 60 years because of its commitment to democracy and the rule of law, which easily qualifies it for the enduring goodwill and support of friends such as Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              I commend and support those comments entirely and say that Australia and Israel are good friends. We admire each other and we work together. I believe that Israel and its people should be remembered for their enormous achievements in adversity. The Jewish community in Australia, I know, will be celebrating at this time in the full knowledge that Australia stands firm as a friend.
