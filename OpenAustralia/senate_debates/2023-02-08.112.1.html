           Minister Gallagher, I ask you to resume your seat. The minister was part-way through a sentence and then the chamber on my left, particularly, became so disorderly, I could not hear her response. I would ask you to listen in respectful silence.

            As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, as at 2 February, there have been 5,067 deaths nationally: 686 in 2020, 226 in 2021, 3,855 in 2022 and 300 in 2023. Now, given the seriousness of the issue that we are talking about, which is the passing of older Australians in aged-care facilities, I think your behaviour just then was disgusting. You ask a question like that and you behave like that. Absolutely disgusting. I had the information. The difference between me and what happened to Senator Colbeck is that I actually had the information. I'm aware of the numbers. I'm aware of what's happening in aged care. So have a laugh over there, by all means, and disrespect the thousands of people in aged care.

                           again just say that any death in relation to COVID-19 and, indeed, in residential aged care, is a tragedy. I think the behaviour of those opposite in the previous question reflects on them and speaks for itself.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Data on the number of deaths in residential aged care is reported directly from aged-care providers to the department. This is not an official dataset and is used for aged-care surveillance purposes. It is not directly comparable with published figures on the total number of COVID-19 deaths in Australia.

                               I reject the assertion and the implication of the way the question is put. That's my answer to the question. I am explaining about how aged-care deaths in Australia are reported. If you're not interested in that, that's not my problem. You asked the question, I'm trying to answer it. The review and adjustment to COVID death reporting, including the timing to release the updated data, was a decision of the department. The Minister for Health was briefed in advance of the release—

                                 In February 2022, the now Prime Minister said that deaths in aged care were a measure of performance. We know that more aged-care residents have now died from COVID in eight months under the Albanese Labor government than in the entire first 2½ years of the pandemic. Given this tragic statistic, will the Prime Minister now admit that he has completely failed on this important measure of performance and step up to the job of protecting older Australians?

                                  Well, we are doing everything we can to ensure that the mortality data—and I will correct the record, if I have to, but the mortality data that I've seen is decreasing compared to the first waves, when residents in aged care were completely unprotected because of the way you rolled out the vaccine rollout. When you rolled out the vaccine rollout, you didn't meet your own targets. You set yourself the targets. What we saw was people in residential aged care who were completely unprotected.

                                      Thank you. The difference between the approach now and the numbers of people with the different waves is that back in 2020 people were left completely unprotected—completely unprotected!—because of the bungle in the rollout. What we have now with omicron, is that the vast majority, in fact very high numbers, of people in residential aged care are protected through the vaccination program.
