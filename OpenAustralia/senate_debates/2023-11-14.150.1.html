        I rise as a proud member of the Albanese Labor government that is making important reforms to make our country stronger, fairer and safer, for this generation and the next. I'm proud to say that consultation is open in my home state of Tasmania for an offshore wind zone in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Strait
        </a>
        , off Tasmania's north coast. This has the potential to unlock secure, regional job opportunities and cleaner, cheaper energy for Tasmanians. This is an exciting opportunity for jobs, education and training and cheaper power bills through renewable energy. It builds on Tasmania's proud renewables history, and it puts us at the top as a world leader in renewable energy generation. It builds on the current five wind farms located in the regions in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        This new potential zone could support thousands of jobs during construction as well as ongoing jobs for Tasmanian residents. Importantly, those jobs will be in regional Tasmania, in our very important regional communities. Once complete, offshore wind will support good, well-paying jobs, providing plenty of cleaner, cheaper renewable energy with engineers, electrical technicians, cable installers, crane operators, riggers, divers and administrators, which is why the Commonwealth government is seeking feedback on the proposed zone, which is at least 20 kilometres from shore at its closest point and 10,136 square kilometres. Submissions to the consultation can be made any time from today until 31 January, and the consultation will include five community drop-in sessions along the north coast of Tasmania, from Burnie to Bridport and Whitemark on

        has said that consultation would support a genuine opportunity for communities to have their say in the first part of the process for developing an offshore wind industry in Tasmania. I agree with the minister that this is a game changer for Tasmania, and it builds on our strength as a clean, green power. We have always led the way in this country with hydro. We will continue to do that, because we're investing in jobs for the future. We want to have renewable clean energy, we want to bring electricity prices down, and this is a major step towards doing that. The Bass Strait is renowned for its offshore wind resources, and this potential zone could transform Tasmania into a new clean energy powerhouse, spurring investment in Tasmanian communities, providing energy security for decarbonising heavy industries and creating thousands of jobs. The benefits of this project will be ongoing and will change our community for the better. In addition to the consultation period opening, these processes provide multiple future opportunities for our community to have their say on these individual projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome this project. It's great for jobs, great for our community and will put downward pressure on electricity prices. It means more opportunity for education and training in engineering, the sciences and trades. It supports
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and training. As part of the Albanese Labor Government I take great pride in the fact that we are investing in TAFE. We are providing fee-free TAFE courses for the sectors where we need more skilled workers. We are investing in our people, and this project means that young Tasmanians can aspire to work in the renewable energy space. I hope it will lead to more Tasmanians staying in Tasmania instead of leaving for jobs on the mainland. Tasmania is a place of opportunity. We need to ensure every Tasmanian understands this sentiment, understands our green energy image and serves our state for the better, and this project is clean, green and job-ready. I commend Minister Bowen for his leadership in this very important sector. I'm proud to be a part of this government and proud to be Tasmanian. I want to see Tasmania take full advantage of thisâ€”
