         Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Legislation Amendment Bill
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Purpose of the Bill
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The bill will amend the
         <i>
          Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
         </i>
         ('the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS" rel="nofollow">
          FITS
         </a>
         Act') and the
         <i>
          National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018
         </i>
         ('the NSLA Act').
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The bill will effect two key changes, both of which are intended to ensure that the FITS Act will operate as always intended:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         a. The FITS Act will be amended to require the Secretary to continue to publish certain information about registered persons after they cease to be registered, including information that was published about them before their registration ceased. While it was always intended that such information should be published, the FITS Act does not presently allow this. Amending the FITS Act to change this will ensure that the public can access information about both past and present instances of foreign influence registered under the FITS Act.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         b. The grace period granted under the NSLA Act will be shortened to a 3 month period which will be further subject to the issuing of election writs. If election writs for either
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
          House of Parliament
         </a>
         are issued before the end of the new 3 month grace period, persons who would otherwise have been entitled to the grace period will have to register within 14 days of the issuing of the writs. This will ensure that the FITS Act scheme is fully operational in time for the next election as always intended.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons" rel="nofollow">
          Reasons
         </a>
         for Urgency
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is critical that the measures in the bill commence in time for the FITS Act's commencement, on 10 December. This will ensure that the FITS Act operates as it was always intended to from the time it first takes effect.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is also critical that the provisions in the bill commence at least 14 days before the expiry of the shortened three month grace which the bill stipulates, and before election writs for either House of Parliament are issued. This will ensure that FITS Act scheme is fully operational in time for the next election. Undesirable consequences could follow if the shortening of the grace period were to commence later on: the period within which certain persons must register could be retrospectively deemed to have run out; or persons could be left with less time to register than the 14 days that the FITS Act would ordinarily allow.

         Reasons for Urgency

        <p class="italic">
         The bills will ensure that the Department of Education and Training's cost recovery arrangements are brought into compliance with requirements of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         Charging Framework.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To date, the Government has not recovered the costs of administering the HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP loan programs from higher education providers. The Australian Government Charging Framework requires that the full cost of regulatory activity be recovered from those entities that generate the need for the activity unless there is a sound rationale for less than full cost recovery â€“ for example, where new charges are being phased in.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For this reason, the annual levy will adopt a partial cost recovery model that will assist with phasing in the new levy on HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP providers in the higher education sector. The FEE-HELP application fee will adopt a full cost recovery model and will only apply to new applications from providers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The new charges are scheduled to be implemented from 1 January 2019. Therefore, passage of the legislation before the end of the 2018 Spring sittings is essential. This will provide adequate time for higher education providers to familiarise themselves with the detail of the annual levy and the FEE-HELP application fee, and to adapt their systems for its implementation ahead of the 2019 academic year.

        <p class="italic">
         The purpose of the Bill is to address the impact of encrypted communications and devices on national security and law enforcement investigations. The Bill will allow agencies to adapt to ubiquitous encryption by using alternative collection capabilities including computer access and increasing penalties where people fail to unlock devices in accordance with a judicial order. It also proposes the development of options to require domestic and foreign companies supplying services to Australia to provide greater assistance to agencies. In particular, the Bill provides a framework for agencies to work with the communications sector to assist law enforcement to adapt to the increasingly complex online environment. The Bill requires both domestic and foreign companies supplying services to Australia to provide greater assistance to agencies.

        <p class="italic">
         The measures in this Bill are critical to the Australian Government's ability to pursue investigations of national security significance that could otherwise be frustrated by encrypted communications and devices. Current investigations are being frustrated by the use of anonymising technologies and encryption.
