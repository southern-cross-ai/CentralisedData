        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Science, Senator Watt. The Albanese government is committed to building a future made in Australia and delivering secure, well-paid jobs for Australians. What will be the impact of Labor's tax cuts on the many tradies working across our country?

         I thank Senator Sterle, who I know has been a long-time supporter of the rights of blue-collar workers in our country. It's a pleasure to work with you on that, Senator Sterle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Put simply, the Albanese government wants Australia to be a country that makes things again. That's why we're working hard to secure a future made in Australia. At the core of that vision are the talented tradies and the regional and outer suburban communities that support them. We can't achieve a future made in Australia without our amazing chippies, sparkies, fitters and other tradespeople. Our manufacturing and construction industries are growing, and now they employ more than two million Australians, including more than 235,000 new jobs since the election of our government. Manufacturing and construction workers from across Australia—those who make our homes, steel, medicines, food, furniture and everything in between—deserve a government that values them and has their back. Labor's tax cuts demonstrate that we are that government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our tradies are the backbone of our manufacturing and construction industry, and under the Albanese Labor government they will all be getting a tax cut. Labor's tax cuts will mean that an entry-level plumber making $56,000 a year will get a tax cut of more than $1,000. And let's look at another vital trade, Australia's welders. Under Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts, a welder helping to build Australian products and making $83,000 a year will get a tax cut of $1,754. And how about those hardworking sparkies? An electrician earning $93,000 will get a tax cut of more than $2,000. Australian tradies can bank on Labor to help them earn more and keep more of what they earn. This government is helping Australian manufacturing and construction businesses to grow, and we're supporting manufacturing and construction workers and tradies to prosper.

           Australia's tradies help so many of our factories, production lines and construction sites to turn out great Australian products every single day. How will Labor's tax cuts ensure that those tradies are able to keep more of what they earn? And why is this so important?

            Thanks again, Senator Sterle, and I can tell you, as someone who recently renovated his own home, that I know exactly how important our local tradies are to our households. But they also play an absolutely vital role for businesses, both large and small. It's important that we all stimulate the local economy, not just talk about it. Whether it's the plumber making sure the water is running, the metalworker keeping the factory production line moving or the sparky keeping the lights on, they will all benefit from Labor's tax cuts.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, every time we see a Liberal frontbencher have a lightbulb moment and go on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
             TV

            , they make their position absolutely clear. They want a return to Scott Morrison's tax plan. When deputy Liberal leader

             Sussan Ley
            </a>
            was asked whether they would roll back Australia's tax cuts, she said, 'Absolutely this is our position.' And, helpfully, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, offered this up himself without being pushed, saying: 'Do we walk away from the principles of stage 3? Absolutely not.'
           </p>
           <p>
            And they even say no right now.
           </p>

            Thank you, Senator Hume! They don't walk away from the—

              I can't wait to get home to see how it's gone! The Liberals' and Nationals' first reaction was to oppose these cuts, and just yesterday Senator Hume promised the Liberals would 'go back to the drawing board on tax cuts'. Why is it important that tradies benefit from Labor's tax cuts, Minister?

                   and low-income earners that you want to take those tax cuts back from them because you never supported them in the first place. You were going to oppose them. You were going to roll them back. Then you voted for them, after saying you wanted an election on them, and you're still in here saying that you want to take those cuts back from Middle Australia and low-income earners.

                   Australian tradies need a government that's going to help them earn more and keep more of what they earn, and we've had it confirmed today that the Liberal Party is all about making them work more and earn less. Thank you very much!
