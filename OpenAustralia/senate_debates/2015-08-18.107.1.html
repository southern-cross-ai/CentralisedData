           In March this year, the government committed to bringing forward a tender for the replacement Pacific patrol boats. The tender, for up to 21 vessels, has now closed, and responses are being assessed by Defence. By expediting this process, the government has demonstrated its commitment to Australian shipbuilders. This announcement in March was complemented by the announcement earlier this month that the future frigate and offshore patrol vessel projects will be brought forward and built in Australia. I can confirm on behalf of the Minister for Defence that the Pacific patrol boats will be built in Australia and that the process is indeed a fair and open one.

              For Tasmania, as an island state, the maritime industry has always been and will continue to be extremely important. When Labor were in government, we worked proactively so Tasmania could take its rightful place in Australia's defence shipbuilding efforts. Businesses, unions and local government joined forces with Labor and succeeded in establishing a Defence precinct at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Bay" rel="nofollow">
               Prince of Wales Bay
              </a>
              , near Hobart. The Tasmanian Maritime Network is more than ready and able to take on Defence contracts which will create hundreds of jobs for the maritime industry in Tasmania. These jobs will include much-needed apprenticeships and traineeships for young Tasmanians. Importantly, there would be flow-on effects across the state. Tasmania has an international reputation for building boats, and we have the skills to fit out any Navy boats, insulate them and provide communications. I commend the motion to the Senate.
