       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Is FOFMS still a FaHCSIA system, which has as yet not been transferred to the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (SEWPaC) management.

       <p class="italic">
        (2) Has the NRAS team, or anyone else at SEWPaC, requested access to FOFMS.

       <p class="italic">
        (3) Did either of the abovementioned meetings discuss any matter pertaining to the SEWPaC's portfolio, for example, NRAS or the Housing Supply Council; if not: (a) is there another forum where SEWPaC officers can discuss these issues with their state counterparts; and (b) how is this information shared between FaHCSIA and SEWPaC.

       <p class="italic">
        (1) Can an outline be provided as to what mechanisms are now in place to facilitate communication between people within the SEWPaC and FaHCSIA portfolios, with relation to: (a) interdepartmental meetings; (b) interdepartmental memos; (c) joint seminar series/training days etc; and (d) secondment programs.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Recent changes to NRAS to better facilitate institutional investment were announced at just about the same time as the proposed cuts â€“ is this evidence of a lack of communication between Treasury and SEWPaC.

        The transitional safety net to cover charities participating in NRAS
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given that in November 2008 the Government introduced a transitional safety net to cover charities participating in the NRAS, that this safety net amended both charity and tax law to ensure that charitable organisations, such as not-for-profit housing providers, would not have their charitable status jeopardized and lose tax concessions because of their participation in NRAS, and that this safety net was targeted to charitable organisations participating during the establishment phase of the NRAS that is for dwellings built in 2008-09 and 2009-10 and would expire at the end of that establishment phase.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) What is current situation for charitable organisations participating in NRAS.
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        (1) How is the SEWPaC looking at implementing COAG's Housing Supply and Affordability Reform agenda, which as the 'Red Book' advised, includes examining the ways under-utilised government land could be reallocated to affordable housing.

         (3) In accordance with the National Rental Affordability Scheme Regulations 2008, the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (DSEWPaC) attempts to notify all applicants of the result of their application within six months of receipt. While we do not maintain statistics on overall average processing times, the majority of applications are fully processed within four months.

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Yes. Members of both the NRAS and Housing Affordability Branches within DSEWPaC continue to have access to FOFMS.

         (2) No. Treasury and DSEWPaC consult on relevant NRAS matters. The two announcements were communicating different issues. The taxation changes announced had been in train for some time, and are required regardless of the size of the number of NRAS Incentives to be issued.

Treasury has advised DSEWPaC that this decision replaced the need for an extension of the temporary safety net that was put in place to provide certainty that charitable Community Housing Organisations would retain their charitable status if participating in NRAS.
