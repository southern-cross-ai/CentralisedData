        Unlike the previous question, I have a serious policy question, this time to the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash, who I note works and operates in regional Australia. Can the minister advise the Senate of the important role that the

         I thank Senator Macdonald for his question. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         has a long and proud history of working with those in communities in rural, regional and remote Australia. From Swanbourne to Singleton, the critical role of the ADF can be felt in our local regional communities. Through the defence white paper announced last week the government will deliver greater security and opportunity for regional Australia. It is a plan for Australia's long-term defence.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will provide approximately $195 billion in investment in capability over the next decade, a significant proportion of which will be spent in Australia. A strong, agile and dynamic economy and defence go hand in hand. With a good proportion of the defence budget to be spent locally, we will clearly see benefits for our regional communities. Increased construction and development will provide significant opportunities for local industries, such as building and construction,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
          ICT
         </a>
         and logistics. There will be more jobs and more opportunities for defence related industries to support defence initiatives and increase economic prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the defence white paper uniformed personnel will increase to around 62,400 over the decade to 2025-26, the largest increase since 1993. This growth reflects nearly 5,000 new or reallocated ADF positions, with a net increase of around 2,500 ADF positions over the decade. Many of these benefits will flow into not only the regional communities of Queensland but all those communities home to Defence assets across rural, regional and remote Australia. The ADF has played a critical role in Australia's regions for more than 100 years, and the defence white paper sets a strong foundation for this to continue into the future.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that very encouraging answer, particularly for northern Australia. I ask the minister if she can elaborate on the jobs and growth in regional Australia in my home state of Queensland, particularly up in the north where I come from, and in northern Australia and on how jobs and growth will result from the defence white paper just recently announced?

           I certainly can provide that advice to the senator. Queensland is home to 22,000 Defence personnel that contribute around $3.4 billion to the Queensland economy every year.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
            North Queensland
           </a>
           will see great economic benefits flow from the defence white paper. Townsville will see major improvements to existing Defence infrastructure. Additional wharf space and support facilities will be developed in Cairns to support the 12 new offshore patrol vessels that will be based there. Accommodation facilities will also be upgraded at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
            Lavarack Barracks
           </a>
           in Townsville, which will benefit from a $50 million investment. Townsville will also see benefits as part of around $300 million to $400 million which will be spent on new and enhanced weapons and explosive ordnance facilities across Australia. It is clear that the coalition has a clear plan for Defence and an even clearer plan for jobs and growth in Queensland.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Again, I thank the minister for that very encouraging news. I will just ask the minister how the defence white paper complements other government initiatives for jobs and growth in northern Australia?

             The coalition understand that all parts of government have a role in driving the economic development agenda in regional Australia. I know Senator Macdonald knows that well. The defence white paper investment is well supported by the coalition government's strong regional development approach. This announcement builds on our commitment to key regional roads and infrastructure through programs such as Roads to Recovery, the Mobile Black Spot Program and the Bridges Renewal Program. This is also complemented by the national stronger regions fund, which I might add has its third round closing shortly.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each of these programs contributes to our unflinching focus on jobs and growth for all of those who call regional Queensland and regional Australia home. I look forward to working closely with the defence minister to ensure the strong relationship between Defence and regional development can continue and deliver greater outcomes to those in rural, regional and remote Australia.
