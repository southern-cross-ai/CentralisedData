        I present the explanatory memoranda and move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.

        I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in

        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The speech read as follows—
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 seeks to address the democratic deficit occasioned by the proposal to inflict a carbon tax on the people of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Having solemnly promised that there would be no carbon tax, Labor received a mandate from the Australian people not to introduce a carbon tax. Similarly, the Coalition promised no carbon tax. Between them the Coalition and Labor obtained the vast majority of votes and seats in the Parliament at the 2010 election.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And therefore, the views of the electorate—when it came to the question of Australia's introducing a carbon tax—were clear and unequivocal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Shortly after the election, the Government broke their promise when the Prime Minister announced that she would impose a carbon tax. A carbon tax will impact every Australian's cost of living, jeopardise jobs and our international competitiveness, whilst doing nothing for the environment. Its impact will be immense. That is why six days before the last election—in the face of polls indicating a possible hung parliament—the Prime Minister solemnly promised that there would be no carbon tax.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is no doubt that if the Government had promised a carbon tax before the election, the Coalition would have won.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The carbon tax is the price the Australian people are being asked to pay for Labor to form its alliance with the Greens. Through this Bill, the Coalition proposes to give the Australian people a voice that was denied them at the last election. A voice will be given to the Australian people by affording them an opportunity to vote pursuant to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Electoral Commission will conduct the plebiscite—voting will be compulsory. The vote will be held on a date to be determined by the Government, but before or on the last Saturday in November 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The question to be asked will be: "Do you support the Government's plan to introduce a price on carbon to deal with climate change?" This is a neutral question. And if the Government is so sure that it has the people's support to price carbon, then it shouldn't be scared of this question, a plebiscite or the result.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But yet the Government has a huge moral dilemma which is preventing them taking the honourable position of supporting this Bill. It made a solemn promise not to introduce a carbon tax.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has broken this promise—it intends to introduce a carbon tax.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The people of Australia have been denied a voice. The suggestion that the hung parliament introduces a new paradigm is correct. It does not, however, justify a complete and wholesale breach of a fundamental and central election promise made by the Government to the Australian people.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coalition" rel="nofollow">
         The Coalition
        </a>
        offers its support for the Government to remain true to its word. The faith of the Australian people in their democratic processes is being severely tested by the breach of trust represented by the Government's intention to introduce a carbon tax.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will restore the rightful place of the Australian people in the debate over a carbon tax.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And if the Prime Minister was honourable, she would give the people their chance to be heard.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If she doesn't listen then it is more likely than not that the Australian people will speak even more loudly at the next election.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
