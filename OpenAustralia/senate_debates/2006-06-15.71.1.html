            Thank you, Mr Deputy President—and I thank the minister. I understand that today I have been misrepresented by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Broadcasting Corporation
            </a>
            on their news bulletin at, I believe, two o’clock this afternoon, regarding the vote on the disallowance in relation to the Australian Capital Territory Civil Unions Act.

            </a>
            incorrectly stated that the vote would have been different had I been in the chamber. I want to make it very clear for the record that I was paired for that vote. Indeed, I and my three other Australian Democrat colleagues all voted in favour of the disallowance—a disallowance of which I was a co-sponsor.
           </p>
           <p>
            I attempted today to come back from sick leave to be here for this important vote and debate. Despite my best attempts, and being at
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Airport" rel="nofollow">
             Adelaide Airport
            </a>
            at six o’clock this morning and on an aeroplane by 7.30 am, I was still in the same aeroplane at 1.05 pm this afternoon. And as much as I enjoy circling Canberra, it was a great disappointment not to be here for the vote. But I want to make it very clear that my vote was paired and my vote was recorded. My absence did not affect the outcome of the vote. Contrary to ABC claims, the vote would not have been closer had I been sitting in this chamber.
           </p>
           <p>
            In closing, I do not think anyone doubts my personal commitment and political commitment to these issues, particularly in relation to gay and lesbian issues and same-sex couples—as my private member’s bill, which was introduced today, attests.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope the ABC will get the voting information right. I acknowledge their attempts in the last hour or so to correct the record.

             I would just like to confirm Senator Stott Despoja’s comments and point out that the government did pair Senator Stott Despoja. She was paired to the opposition, which meant that her vote was taken into account as supporting the motion.
