        Mr Rudd must be confident about his numbers. My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. Can the Minister assure the Senate and the Australian people that the government, of which he is a member, is united and cohesive?

         Once again, those opposite have an opportunity to take advantage of the democratic process in this country—question time—and they could ask about any topic that they want, but as always they want to go the low road. They could ask, 'How robust is Australia's economic growth and performance?' and they would be told that we are the envy of the Western world. They could ask, 'What have you done in the health area?' and they would be told that we have significant reforms for more doctors, more nurses and more bed time. They could be asking about education; they could have the opportunity to support the single biggest reform in education—

They could ask about job creation. Those vandals over there were happy to see 200,000 Australians thrown on to the scrap heap, onto the dole, but this government stood firm during the global financial crisis and supported Australian families. We have, according to the February—

             , I ask a supplementary question. I note the question was completely avoided. Was it the low road for Mr Bob Hawke to say: 'If you can't govern yourselves, you cannot govern Australia'? Does the minister agree? Given the continuing chaos and dysfunction of the government and the instability and uncertainty surrounding the Prime Minister's continuing tenure in her high office and, hence, the tenure of all her ministers, how can the government claim to be putting the interest of all Australian people before its own?

That is why we are building a world-class education system through the National Plan for School Improvement. That is why we are focused on creating 950,000 jobs since we came to office, despite 28 million jobs being lost world wide. That is why we are keeping downward pressure on inflation, at 2.5 per cent, below the 10-year average of 2.8 per cent. That is why, because of the economic policies that we are focused on—

Let's see if we can get an answer to this one: does the minister have any conception of how incompetent and untrustworthy he and his colleagues appear to Australian families in their self-interested manoeuvrings over the government's leadership? Does the minister understand that the Australian people deserve to be properly led by a competent and trustworthy government that keeps its promises, does what it says and always puts the interests of all Australians first?

                  It is true, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, because Mr Abbott was asked about it after the 2004 election. What do you think Mr Abbott said? 'I did think about resigning over that one, because, you know, I clearly got rolled in cabinet later. But, no, I decided to stay in the government.' You have got Mr Tony Abbott, who stared down the barrel of a
