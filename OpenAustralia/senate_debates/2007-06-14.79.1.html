         While Labor support the basis of Senator Murray’s amendment, Labor do not support this amendment. Labor have already announced selection processes for government bodies such as the ABC board and our Fair Work Australia. The selection processes that Labor have announced demonstrate our commitment to the Nolan principles on which this amendment is based.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Nolan principles which govern appointments in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         require that appointments are merit based and that the process of appointment is independent and transparent. Labor and all the other parties have advocated merit based appointments, while this government has continued to be silent through its inaction. Labor believes that that issue of government appointment is essential to uphold public trust in government bodies. The establishment of a merit based selection process for government appointments is a safeguard but not a full protection against political appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor notes the disintegration of constitutional conventions regarding responsible government under this Howard government. This is not an issue that can be fixed simply by inserting an amendment into this bill. There should be a proper consultation with relevant bodies on the government selection processes, as well as consideration of other aspects which should be included to make the appointment process more independent and transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Winemakers Federation of Australia have spoken to me about these amendments and feel that it would have been more appropriate had they been consulted about them. Without expressing a view on them, they thought that that would have been an appropriate course of action if the Democrats wanted their support in relation to these amendments.
