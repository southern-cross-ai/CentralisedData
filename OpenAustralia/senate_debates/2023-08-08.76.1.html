        Over the last 24 hours, two seemingly unconnected events have occurred. The first of those, yesterday morning in this place, was when Andrew Wallace brought before a number of my coalition colleagues and me some representatives of the Hazara communities, approximately two years on from the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban. They told us some extremely harrowing accounts of the circumstances in Afghanistan, particularly for women and children. Inability to get an education is one that's been talked about, and I've talked about it in this place myself a number of times. Another is aid not getting out to regions and supporting communities.
