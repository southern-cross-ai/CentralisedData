        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Human Services (Senator Payne) to a question without notice asked by Senator Moore today relating to International Women’s Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across the country and particularly in my own state of Queensland, a whole calendar of events is planned to take place over the next few days to celebrate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        . These events will acknowledge the history of women and look at what has happened to them to ensure that we celebrate the strength of women in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of my question and the extremely short answers provided by Minister Payne, I did hear comments made by Senator Macdonald, asking me directly as to how many times I have been at the Tattersall's Club. I can think of three times. One occasion was to attend a family function that was called by another person, whom I knew well. Another occasion was to attend a Royal Historical Society
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
         AGM
        </a>
        and celebration dinner. I did say that I was concerned about attending the Tattersall's Club but I could not not attend because it was a very important occasion where a friend of mine was receiving an award. Another occasion was when I attended a Senate inquiry, where the committee had chosen to have its meeting at the Tattersall's Club. It will not happen again, because I raised my concerns at the time and they acknowledged that it was not the appropriate place to have such an inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have no particular problem with the beautiful facilities at the Brisbane Tattersall's Club. However, I do have a problem in that, when we check out the membership of that club, we find that it is a proud businessman's club, which has been able to offer membership only to men for the whole 150 years of its existence. Indeed, not only is it just a men's club but, in the last few years, they conducted a public vote of their members—who, as we know, do not identify as women—to see whether women would be allowed to have membership to that club. By a significant number, the members of the Tattersall's Club decided that that would not occur and that they would not be offering membership of that club to women. It is on that basis, which is the only basis on which I have raised my concerns, that I ask: is this the appropriate place to hold an event celebrating International Women's Day?
       </p>
       <p>
        Similar questions were asked yesterday in the other place. The Prime Minister, who is the Minister for Women, said it was a fabulous result and that it in fact represented a breaking down of the 'ceiling'. I trust that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        women will not be breaking down any ceilings at the Tattersall's Club, because it would be very expensive to be doing any breaking of ceilings in that club. I was particularly interested that it was one defence. Another defence by the Queensland LNP was that the club was available and they had had to organise the occasion at short notice. I feel certain that a few other venues would have been available. And we actually know the day of International Women's Day!
       </p>
       <p>
        But the defence that is my personal favourite is one that has been highly publicised, and it was made by LNP women's vice-president and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        businesswoman, Ms Simpson. She has come out and openly said that she feels the reason that it is important to have such an event at the Tattersall's Club is that it is similar to the actions of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks" rel="nofollow">
         Rosa Parks
        </a>
        , who made a statement when she went on a bus in Alabama and brought forward issues of equity. I celebrate the fact that the women of the LNP are going to be taking such peaceful action to raise issues of equity in our community. The way it has been presented by the LNP vice-president is that, seemingly, the lunch or the breakfast or the function to celebrate International Women's Day is some sort of peaceful occupation of the Tattersall's Club. We know the issues around that wonderful example of community action taken by that very strong woman from Alabama, Rosa Parks. Part of her action was not to leave the bus. She was on the bus and she was going to stay on the bus until she could take her rightful place at the front of the bus.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to celebrate the actions of the LNP for holding their event at the proudly male-membership-only Tattersall's Club in Brisbane. They will be having a peaceful occupation of that venue to celebrate International Women's Day. I also want to offer my support, because should those women not be able to leave the club because of their occupation, I am prepared to stand outside and say: 'Good on you, LNP, because you are actually breaking that glass ceiling.' You are making a statement and perhaps your activity will be successful.

         I very much appreciate Senator Moore highlighting the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
          LNP
         </a>
         women in Queensland. I do not think I could have given a more sterling vote of support for LNP women than Senator Moore has just done. Regrettably, we do not see those sorts of highlights from the Labor Party. Are we having a Labor Party function to highlight international women's week? We do not seem to having any. But I am very grateful to Senator Moore for just recognising what a broad church the LNP in Queensland is. While I am at it, I indicate that the LNP in Queensland is very well run by a couple of very, very strong women in Theresa Craig, who is the president, Peta Simpson, the vice-president, who Senator Moore kindly mentioned in what I can only call her 'strange' sort of speech.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do not know why the LNP women decided to have the function there. I am glad they did. It indicates that in Queensland the LNP women are doing things for the right reasons, not for the silly reasons that Senator Moore seems to be fascinated with in this chamber. The LNP women are a great group of people. They are a very significant part of the LNP in Queensland. Whilst I do not have the statistics in front of me, my assessment from attending state councils, state conventions, branch meetings and area meetings would be that women comprise, if not more than 50 per cent, a very good percentage of the branch membership of Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         I did not see Senator Moore regretting so much the number of LNP state members who were defeated at the last Queensland election. It was a pity Senator Moore did not show some interest when the unions that she supports, and the Greens political party's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GetUp" rel="nofollow">
          GetUp
         </a>
         ! group, campaigned dishonestly against those women members of the LNP. I did not see Senator Moore making much comment about that.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Moore says that she has been at Tattersall's three times. She obviously enjoys going there. I have been there a few times, as well. I am not a member but I have reciprocal rights from the North Queensland Club, which is a similar social community club in Townsville. The president of this club is Ms Glenys Schuntner, a very important and significant woman in Townsville. She runs that club, and it is a similar club to the Queensland Club and the Tattersall's Club.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do not know the rules of the Tattersall's Club. What I do know is that, clearly, Senator Moore has been able to go there. On the few times that I have been there, I have taken my wife in, and not one person has challenged me. In fact, during LNP conventions, which are sometimes held down the road, or used to be, I have stayed there with my wife and we would bring in people that I was familiar with. We would all go in and have a beer. Half of them would have been women. I was never challenged by anyone for women coming in, having a drink and enjoying the facilities there. So I do not know what Senator Moore's fascination is with this subject. I know Senator Moore is capable of a much better contribution to the policy debate of our nation rather than raising pathetically irrelevant issues like this in question time.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to conclude where I started: I am, again, very grateful to Senator Moore for highlighting the importance of women in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Liberal National Party
         </a>
         of Queensland and the very significant role that the LNP women play in our party in Queensland. I just regret that the Labor Party were not doing things more positively to highlight all of the good things about women in the world.

          I, too, rise to speak on the outrage of members of the

           LNP
          </a>
          , and even more so the LNP Women vice president Peta Simpson. Before I go to the outrage that I will express, let me be clear:
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
           International Women's Day
          </a>
          , on 8 March, is about '
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_It_Happen" rel="nofollow">
           Make It Happen
          </a>
          '. Across Queensland and across Australia there will be many functions celebrating the achievements of women and the effective action of advancing and recognising women. Thousands of events will occur. Of course, it will be about making and recognising the economic, political and social achievements of women across Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          I do not think that—and I think many Australians would agree with me—celebrating it at the Tattersall's Club in Brisbane is in accordance with that aim. It is appalling that those opposite have simply laughed off the fact that an International Women's Day lunch is to be held at the men-only Tattersall's Club in Brisbane tomorrow—not even on 8 March.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ms Simpson, the vice president, is quoted as saying that could not think of a better place. Well, she certainly did not turn her mind to it very deeply. One person said: 'You couldn't make this stuff up!' I agree with that person entirely. It is beyond belief to think that you could not make this stuff up. In defending the choice, as Senator Moore said, Ms Simpson cited an iconic woman of the American civil rights movement. She tried to liken it to the American civil rights movement. I am appalled. Quite frankly, I would be disgusted that you would try to use that analogy if you had read anything about the American civil rights in that period.

It is a disgrace to draw that comparison. The LNP and those opposite should bow their heads in shame. It just shows how much out of touch the LNP, particularly those in Queensland, are.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Ms Simpson has spoken of the symbolism of having the event at the Tattersall's Club. What symbolism? The fact that a men-only club will allow women to hang off the arm of an ignorant man. The Tattersall's Club always has been and always will be a boys' club. In fact, women are reminded to bring along their partner's card.

          During question time yesterday, Mr Tony Abbott sang the praises of the LNP and the wonderful broad church that he leads. Mr Abbott, let me assure you, through you, Mr Deputy President Marshall, the church you lead is one of men who follow the bastion of old-fashioned chauvinism, quite frankly. That is the Tattersall's Club; not a modern and vibrant economy that can celebrate the achievements of women on 8 March.
         </p>
         <p>
          You would be mistaken for thinking that this is all just some sort of joke, that we can just laugh it off. But this is beyond parody. We are clearly expecting too much from a party that has a male Minister for Women. Mr Abbott attempting a comedic defence in the House yesterday was, quite frankly, disappointing and should be left in the dustbin of history and not trailed through this place.
         </p>
         <p>
          The LNP and those opposite have made a mockery of the day that is about celebrating the achievements of women and bringing light to the issues that women face. The fact that Mr Abbott says that the venue was chosen due to the short notice of the function, quite frankly, just goes to show the LNP's blatant disregard for the importance of International Women's Day.

           . Somehow the Labor Party are appalled and outraged about this. We had the attempted humour by Senator Moore and we had the attempted outrage from Senator Ludwig. But I would make one point: I am none the wiser about whether Senator Ludwig is actually a member of the Tattersalls club or not. That is the question I was trying to get out of him through his debate but I am none the wiser about that.

           As a man within the Liberal Party, I am quite proud to say that we have been pioneers over the course of time in promoting and advancing the interests of women. Who could forget that

           and, once again, the Liberal Party championed that. Who was the first female minister with portfolio responsibilities? Let me guess. Was it on the Labor side? No, it was not. It was Senator Annabelle Rankin, who was appointed Minister for Housing in 1966 for the Liberal Party. Who was the first woman to be appointed to cabinet and administer a government department? It was Senator Margaret Guilfoyle, who was appointed the Minister for Education and Minister for

           in 1975. She was in cabinet in 1976, once again, for the Liberal Party. We have a proud history. We have the first female Minister for Foreign Affairs in the current cabinet. We had the first female President of this place, Senator Margaret Reid, who was a proud

           I do not want to take any lectures from the Labor Party who, instead of promoting people on merit, have to go through a process in which they play gender cards in order to claim their own positions. I reject that in its entirety. In doing so, they exhibit blatant hypocrisy. When they had a democratic vote of their rank and file—like in South Australia to choose their Senate candidates—and they chose someone of the fine quality and characteristics like former Senator Don Farrell as their No. 1 person and they chose Senator Penny Wong as the No. 2 person on that ticket, all hell broke loose. There was a whisper campaign, there was nastiness and there was this whole thing about claiming misogyny and everything else until Senator Farrell, in a fit of chivalry, which is very old-fashioned in this day and age, stood aside to allow Senator Wong to be No. 1 so she would stop complaining about how badly she had been treated by the Labor Party members. The price of that chivalry was that Senator Farrell is no longer politically with us. It did illustrate the point that the Labor Party have demonstrated enormous hypocrisy in their purported standing up for the advancement of women whilst at the same token abusing us for it. It is quite extraordinary.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also make the point: who can forget the gross betrayal of former Prime Minister Ms Gillard? Tearing down a first-term Prime Minister is quite an extraordinary thing to do, but to do it twice in two terms is extraordinary in itself. So I do not think we can have lectures on treating women respectfully by those on the other side, no amount matter how much they want to claim.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would make the point that the Prime Minister and indeed the Leader of the Opposition both signed this week the HeForShe Commitment in the parliament. I am hearing today this sort of excuse that somehow men are not able to participate in a conversation about gender equality. In actual fact, if you are having a function for women that is held in a prestigious venue like the Tattersalls club notwithstanding whatever membership restrictions they may have there, the simple point is it is saying this is a very important point, a very important issue that needs to be held up.

             I hear Senator McLucas saying she is not allowed to go there. You should perhaps talk to Senator Moore, Senator McLucas, because Senator Moore has been there on a number of occasions. So she does not object to the Tattersalls club because she goes there and enjoys it. It is quite extraordinary. My suggestion would be to those senators who are a bit envious on the other side is that they speak to Senator Moore and look about how they can access her access to the Tattersalls club.

              I rise to take note of the answers to questions today to the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, Senator Payne. Today, I believe, is a sad indictment of women that the Queensland

              breakfast tomorrow at the men's Tattersalls club. It is unbelievable. What it does say is the attitude of the coalition towards women is that they will only meet with women on their own turf. It is extraordinary. And they expect women to be grateful. I do not know, maybe some women in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
               LNP
              </a>
              think that being allowed into a men's club for breakfast is an honour. I do not think so. And that is what the Prime Minister says. It is not an honour; it is plain chauvinistic.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do not mind if you support the LNP; that is fine, many strong women do. I say to women who are thinking of attending this event that International Women's Day is not about politics. As my colleague Senator Ludwig said, the theme of the 2015 International Women's Day is '
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_It_Happen" rel="nofollow">
               Make It Happen
              </a>
              '. You can actually support this event by not actually attending and calling for greater equality. The Prime Minister claims that letting women in for one breakfast is smashing the glass ceiling. If you were smashing the glass ceiling you would refuse to go to the club until they actually let women join. This whole thing is unbelievable and it is condescending towards women. Why not hold your meeting in a women's shelter? Why not actually use International Women's Day to understand the plight of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable women in this country? Inviting women to a men's club is only patronising.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also patronising is the fact that yesterday Senator Cash stood up at the

              in Canberra and talked about the importance of tackling family and domestic violence—while, at the same time, the only family violence service in Katherine got a phone call and an email from their government to say that their funding is being cut in half. The Katherine women's legal service provides vital front-line services to victims of family violence, and I repeat: this is the only one in Katherine. They have had their funding cut in half by Senator Scullion. They now have to reduce their staff by two, move to smaller premises and cut back on vital work that they do in remote communities in their outreach program. If providing support for women who are being bashed and beaten is not a front-line service, then what is? The gap will never be closed if services that are working to close the gap have their funding cut.
             </p>
             <p>
              To be honest, I am sick and tired of all the people who put on white ribbons and talk about family violence while at the same time ripping funding away from front-line services. It is absolutely disgraceful. Of course, we all want to reduce domestic violence, and I am not questioning that in this parliament there is bipartisan support for tackling family violence. But it means absolutely nothing if services are being cut.
             </p>
             <p>
              Domestic violence is an issue right around this country. Two women a week are killed by their partners. In my home territory, Katherine has some of the highest rates of domestic violence in this country, and 2013 and 2014 have seen more domestic violence assaults than ever before. Katherine is at the forefront. Per capita, the rate of family violence in Katherine is four to five times greater than in Darwin and 10 times greater than in the rest of Australia.

              , was stabbed to death in Katherine late last year. That is an absolute tragedy but it illustrates the incredible levels of violence in this area. But funding has been cut. It is insane, it is madness and it is wrong. I will say again: if you are an Aboriginal woman you are 80 times more likely to be hospitalised because of assault than any other Australian.

             <p>
              I challenge all the women and men who are going to the men-only Tattersalls Club for International Women's Day: come to the Territory. Come to Katherine and see bashed and bloodied women, or go to

              emergency department, which is often described as a 'war zone'. Go to the women's shelter in Alice Springs that has to turn away, on average, seven women and their children every night—desperate women who have nowhere else to go. That is where I will be this Sunday. That is where I am going to be on International Women's Day. Men-only clubs are relics of the past. I condemn the LNP for holding their International Women's Day event there.
