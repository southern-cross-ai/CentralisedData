        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Bob Carr. I refer the minister to the comments he made in the Senate on 17 September:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … by deferring Defence acquisitions and adjusting the Defence capital equipment program … There will be no adverse impact on operations—they are all fully funded. There will be no adverse impact on military numbers in the navy, army or air force. There will be no adverse important implications for kit for forces about to be deployed or in deployment. There will be no reductions in conditions or entitlements for servers—
       </p>

        Given that, following the minister's comments, jungle training exercises for the

           , on the point of order: that summary of the question, which we all found very difficult to keep up with, I think is very unrealistic. Given that the minister has been on his feet for about 15 seconds I think the point of order is not relevant.

            The minister has been addressing the question for 16 seconds. I will listen closely to the answer of the minister. At this stage there is no point of order. Minister, you have one minute 44 remaining.

             aircraft and Anzac class ships. I repeat that there is also a planned reduction of 1,000 civilian positions in the defence department and they will be achieved primarily through natural attrition and tightening of recruitment practices. Most savings are coming from deferring some defence acquisitions and adjusting the defence capital equipment program but also from delivering further operating efficiencies. None of the savings will impede our nation's defences. The government has made its choices very carefully. There will be no adverse impact on operations at fully funded. There will be no adverse impact on military numbers: Navy, Army,

               All this has been said before—and no reductions in conditions or entitlements for service personnel. The focus of the budget's capability activities will be on improving airlift, land mobility, submarines, afloat support, communications, interoperability and electronic and cyber warfare. A number of projects will also be progressed to enhance the availability and capability of the current Collins class submarines. The government has also approved $214 million for further detailed studies and analysis to inform the government's decision on the design of Australia's next submarines.

                , I have a supplementary question. I refer the minister to comments of former Army chief Professor Peter Leahy, who said that he was concerned at the impact of budget cuts across a range of defence areas including special forces training, warning it would impact on morale and readiness in the future. In light of Professor Leahy's statement, will the minister categorically rule out further budgetary vandalism to the Defence Force budget in MYEFO?

                 . There are a range of administrative and minor capital equipment savings that are going to be made and a number of lower priority capability projects that will be deferred, with a small number cancelled where they have been superseded by alternative capabilities, and other capability and facility programs will be subjected to rescoping. The reprioritisation of defence expenditure has been designed to have minimum impact on the delivery of core defence capabilities. The provision of equipment to defence personnel on operations will not be adversely affected and there will be no adverse impact on the number of military personnel in the
