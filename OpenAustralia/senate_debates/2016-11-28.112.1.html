            The government opposes this motion. The matters proposed to be referred to the Senate

             Standing Committee
            </a>
            of Privileges are excessively broad in scope and extend to matters of intelligence and law enforcement oversight that are more properly dealt with in other contexts, including the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
             Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
            </a>
            . Not only are our intelligence and law enforcement agencies already subject to robust oversight of legislation in operations; but shortly our intelligence agencies will be subject to further scrutiny in the context of the independent review into Australia's intelligence community announced by the Prime Minister on Monday, 7 November.

                on Privileges is about the issue of metadata domestic preservation orders and the chilling effect that such orders can have on the provision of information to members of parliament in order to enable them to carry out their functions. This is not about the executive arm of government. The issue of privilege and the work of parliamentarians ought to be a matter for the Senate to determine, and that is why this reference to the privileges committee is so important.
