        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. I refer to a media report and a statement issued by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance
        </a>
        on 21 February 2024 regarding the department's inappropriate disclosure of the commercially sensitive pricing information for up to 400 businesses. Recent reports from InnovationAus.com claim that up to 200 of these impacted businesses have yet to sign any confidentiality agreement to prevent the disclosure of pricing information. Minister, when were you informed that this disclosure had occurred?

         I thank Senator Hume for the question. This is a really disappointing issue. Commercially sensitive information from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAS" rel="nofollow">
          MAS
         </a>
         Panel has again been inadvertently disclosed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Finance
         </a>
         in an administrative error. I would have to check the date, but it was around 19 or 20 February that I was advised, and Finance had certainly been in touch with my office. I was travelling last week, so I would just have to check that. I think on 21 February the secretary issued a statement on the disclosure of information, and I think the next day the secretary also announced a review into how these two MAS Panel disclosures have occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've spoken again on my return from overseas with the secretary about the work that has been done, including individually contacting suppliers and working very closely with them through the department to seek undertakings from them. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I understand that there were a number where the email hadn't been opened and the email was deleted after contact by the Department of Finance. But I can tell you that the department is doing everything it can to ensure that we minimise the impact on suppliers and certainly that this never happens again. I would also say that there is work being done to support staff that have been involved in this, and the inquiry will get to the bottom of what has led to the error in disclosure of this sensitive information.

           Minister, the department of health reportedly disclosed commercially sensitive pricing information back in November 2023. At that time, you provided assurances that this couldn't happen again. I ask you, Minister, following that bungle in 2023, how did you satisfy yourself that the issues within the government had been fixed?

            I think your question said 'the department of health', but you're referring to the earlier disclosure on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAS" rel="nofollow">
             MAS
            </a>
            P?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, there have been two inappropriate disclosures on the MAS Panel, as I recall it. I had a number of discussions with the secretary of Finance. Ms Wilkinson did a lot of work with the relevant area. They're dealing with these matters all the time. I was confident in my briefings with the department and with the internal investigation that was conducted that steps had been taken to make sure this wouldn't happen again. Obviously it has. That's why the inquiry by Mr Manthorpe is so important. I don't want to get ahead of that, so we'll wait for that inquiry to be held. I understand that it's only going to be a matter of weeks.

              Minister, your government has twice damaged confidence in the Commonwealth's ability to work with the private sector. Can you tell the chamber: What number of organisations have signed those confidentiality agreements? Have you sought advice on the potential legal liability created by this breach? If not, why not?
