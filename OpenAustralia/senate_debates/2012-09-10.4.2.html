       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2)   That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 29 August 2012, of Sapper James Thomas Martin, during operations in Afghanistan, places on record its appreciation of his service to our country, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family, friends and colleagues in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>

        , in a helicopter crash while on combat operations in Afghanistan, places on record its appreciation of his service to our country, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family, friends and colleagues in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5)   That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 30 August 2012, of Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher, in a helicopter crash while on combat operations in Afghanistan, places on record its appreciation of his service to our country, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family, friends and colleagues in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a terrible two days in Australia's military history, and I know all the Senate sends its support and best wishes to the families of the deceased soldiers and their colleagues.
