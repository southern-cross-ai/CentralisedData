         CCAMLR's Scientific Committee provides scientific advice to the Commission on the management of the marine living resources of the CCAMLR Convention Area. The principles of the Convention on the Conservation of Marine Living Resources are based on the precautionary approach and seek to conserve Antarctic marine living resources and the integrity of the

          Southern Ocean

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Consistent with Australia's position on domestic marine protected areas, Australia considers that marine protected areas in the CCAMLR Area can include multiple use areas in which 'no take zones' and commercial activities, including fishing, can occur in an ecologically sustainable manner.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The principles of CCAMLR are based on the precautionary approach and seek to conserve Antarctic marine living resources and the integrity of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. The CCAMLR principles also serve to protect the long term viability of the marine living resources and commercial interests of fisheries in the Convention Area.
