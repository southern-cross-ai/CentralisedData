The world is waking up to this egregious abuse of power, this injustice. They are waking up to the fact that you only published the truth and that what you published has actually helped us understand the systems and the institutions that we're all part of and has helped the world become a better place. We are not giving up the fight for you, Julian. Stay strong over Christmas. Whether you are in Belmarsh prison or in a US maximum-security prison, we are thinking of you and we are there for you.
