        My question is to Senator Coonan, the minister for communications. I refer the minister to Telstra’s plans to dramatically slash payphone services in Australia. Is the minister aware that, after privately briefing both the Liberal and the National Party caucus rooms, Telstra

          ‘I think what you saw Senator Coonan say late in the week was that the company should do the things that we were doing, in terms of removing uneconomic investments.’ Since the minister conceded yesterday that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USO" rel="nofollow">
           USO
          </a>
          protects only 7,500 of Telstra’s 32,000 payphones and that Telstra should look at some rationalisation of payphones, the question is: why has the minister given the green light to the removal of up to 25,000 payphones if Telstra deems them uneconomic? Will the minister now release the list and map of Telstra’s payphone cuts?

           Thank you to Senator Conroy for the question. I was worried that Senator Conroy would not get a question through his questions committee today. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to disabuse the Senate of the assumptions implicit in Senator Conroy’s questions. There is no suggestion that 23,000 payphones were subject to being removed by Telstra.

              . What we have in fact done is make the supply, installation and maintenance of payphones part of the universal service obligation. We have done this because we recognise that access to payphones is an important community service. It is critical that pay telephones that are subject to the universal service obligation are maintained. Payphones that are non-commercial, where I said that there are more than two in one particular location—

                        The interesting thing about this is that Labor argues that payphones are a fall-back option for people living in rural areas if they are unable to use a mobile phone. The sad reality is that if Labor had its way payphones would be the only option people would have in rural and regional Australia. Labor would certainly have kept payphones profitable because under a Labor government that would be the only phone people would have in rural and regional areas. Under Labor, people could wait more than two years to have their home phone connected. What an absolute disgrace! Labor closed down analog mobile phones, leaving rural Australians stranded without a service at all. Labor has no real plan to connect rural and regional Australians to broadband. Under Labor, the idea of rural and regional Australians using new technologies like voice over

                        would be unthinkable.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        So while payphones are a very important community service, and they will be maintained where they are subject to the universal service obligation, imagine how critical they would become if Labor were in charge of regional communications. Regional Australians are not fooled by Labor on this issue. They know that if Senator Conroy had his way thousands of rural households that rely on satellite internet services would have their subsidies scrapped. Every subsidy for rural and regional Australia, according to Senator Conroy, is pork-barrelling. It is an absolute disgrace. I have a bit of free advice for Senator Conroy: if you want to find out what is going on in regional Australia, get out of your office in Melbourne and go and ask.

                         , I rise on a point of order. It is about relevance. I asked about how many phones it is that the minister has given the green light to being taken out and about when she is going to give us the hit list. That was the question. She has absolutely avoided it for the last three minutes.

                           , I rise on a new point of order. Senator Conroy raised a point of order about the minister failing to answer the question. I do not know whether you feel intimidated by Senator Minchin’s intervention, but it was a legitimate point of order for Senator Conroy to raise and unrelated to questions of noise in the chamber—the sort of noise that we are now hearing. The reality is that it was a serious point of order about Senator Coonan talking about the Labor Party for four minutes and failing to answer a question that concerns a lot of rurally based Australians.

That is why Senator Conroy wants to keep payphone boxes: so he can hold branch-stack meetings in his phone box. That is what he is doing.

                                , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that Telstra is required to maintain only 7,500 payphones throughout Australia under the
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USO" rel="nofollow">
                                 USO

                                , and is not currently able to account for hundreds of these payphones in its records? How can the universal service obligation possibly provide service guarantees for rural and regional Australia if Telstra is unable to identify its USO payphones? Given that Telstra is intent on doing the absolute minimum required for rural and regional Australia, isn’t the lack of clarity in the USO an open invitation to further slash payphone numbers? When will you table the map you have asked for? When will you table the hit list of the phones to go?

                                 I will say this very slowly for Senator Conroy’s benefit. This government will ensure that where people need payphones they will have them. This government will ensure that where people need broadband they will get it. This government will ensure that where people need telecommunications they will have it, irrespective of where they live. There is no doubt whatsoever that payphones will be maintained under the universal service obligation. Senator Conroy really needs to go and stick to his day job of branch stacking.
