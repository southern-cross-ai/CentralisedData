        Amendment (2)

       <p class="italic">
        Amendment (2) is framed as a request because it amends the bill to increase the income concession amount under the work bonus scheme. The income concession amount contributes to the amount that certain recipients of a social security pension, a service pension or income support supplement can earn before their payment begins to decrease. This means that increasing the income concession amount would result in recipients receiving a higher payment.

       <p class="italic">
        The effect of the amendments would therefore increase the amount of expenditure under the standing appropriations in section 242 of the

        </i>
        and section 199 of the

            Amendment (2) is framed as a request because it amends the bill to increase the various maximum basic rate amounts of age pension, carer payment, disability support pension, disability support pension (under 21), youth allowance, austudy payment, jobseeker payment, farm household allowance, parenting payment (single), parenting payment (partnered), service pension, income support supplement and veteran payment. As the effect of this amendment will be that relevant recipients will receive a higher rate of payment, it will result in an increase in expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the

            Amendment (3) is framed as a request because it amends the bill to increase the ordinary income free area for the disability support pension (under 21), youth allowance (other), jobseeker payment, parenting payment (single) and parenting payment (partnered) under the
            <i>
             Social Security Act 1991
            </i>
            . As the income free area is the amount of income a person can receive before their payment begins to decrease, increasing the income free area would result in some recipients receiving a higher rate of payment and would also increase the number of people for whom payments are payable.
