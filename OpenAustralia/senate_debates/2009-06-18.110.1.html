           I will take that interjection, Senator Abetz, because I understood from the member for Flinders previously that you were supporting this legislation. But you appear to be so divided now that you are opposing it or delaying it. As I recall, he came out saying you were supporting it. The rationale for the renewable energy target—and I think Senator Milne and the Greens are well aware of this—is that we want to provide an incentive that brings forward investment in the range of renewable energy opportunities that Australia has, such as solar, wind, wave and geothermal. Unlike those opposite—and I note that they are very quiet—who presided over a reduction in the amount of renewable energy used in this country as a proportion of electricity—

            , on a point of order: it was a very straightforward question about whether the government believes that the wholesale electricity price would increase or decrease under the

             RET

             The rationale for the renewable energy target is clearly to bring forward investment in renewable energy. It is the case—and I think the Greens would know this—that most forms of renewable energy are currently more expensive than conventional forms of electricity. The reality is that coal fired power generation is still cheaper than renewable energy. So we do require government policy to bring forward investment in renewables to start to reduce the cost gap between conventional and renewable power.

              I assume from the second part of the minister’s answer that she was arguing that there would be an increase in wholesale electricity prices due to the expanded
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RET" rel="nofollow">
               RET
              </a>
              , so I ask a supplementary question. Since three out of the four consultancy reports that have analysed the impact of the RET on electricity prices all disagree with the government’s assumption that there would be an increase in price, and studies by
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRA" rel="nofollow">

               ROAM
              </a>
              Consulting all conclude that electricity prices will fall, what is the government’s basis for rejecting the conclusions of those modellers in favour of the special pleading from the big polluters?

              <p>
               I appreciate that the Greens have a view about this. The fact is that as a result of the failure by previous governments to invest in renewable energy there is still a cost gap between renewables and conventional forms of energy. That means that we do have to put in place policies which create investment, which bring forward investment and which give an incentive for people to use and to generate renewable energy. We need to put in place incentives for business to develop wave resources, geothermal resources, solar and so forth.

                  , will drive around $19 billion in renewable investment out to 2020. That is the nature of the investment that this government’s policies will pump into that sector. On the question about exemptions, I appreciate the Greens have a different view on this issue—

                   Consulting regarding electricity prices falling and instead just went with the McLennan Magasanik Associates advice when those consultancy firms all concluded that electricity pool prices would be reduced by a five per cent margin if those low-cost, short-run marginal cost renewables came into the generation mix? Why did the government not look at those other reports and instead just accept the view that the old polluters had to be sandbagged under this legislation?
