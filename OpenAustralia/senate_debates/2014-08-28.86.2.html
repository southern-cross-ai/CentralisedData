        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to the Minister for Defence's statement yesterday on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        that:

        is, firstly, not sustainable and, secondly, unfair.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is the Minister for Defence correct?

         The government's position on this is very clear. For any change to occur to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         distribution, there requires to be a unanimity of view between the premiers, chief ministers and the Prime Minister. Indeed, the view that was expressed by Senator Mark Bishop, a former Labor senator from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         —not unsurprisingly, has found a degree of support in Western Australia. But let's be exceptionally clear on this: the government's view on this is well known and the agreement between the states and the Commonwealth is well known.

            GST

            , Senator Johnston is not a comrade; he is a brother to me, and I am delighted to see Senator Johnston working with this government to try to achieve the very best outcome. It stands to reason that the Senate, which is the states house, will from time to time have people championing their specific state. However, the government's view—and that is what I was seeking to express prior to Senator Moore's point of order—in this area is very clear, and question time is usually devoted to matters of government and government policy, not to my personal views on somebody else's personal views.

              The senator is very clear in what she said. She said 'has been' a mendicant state. As of March this year it is no longer so, because good government has been delivered to the people of Tasmania through the ballot box by electing
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hodgman" rel="nofollow">
               Will Hodgman
              </a>
              as the Premier. As we speak—or very soon hereafter—Treasurer Peter Gutwein will be delivering their first budget, which will restore Tasmania's fortunes.
             </p>
             <p>
              I agree with Senator Johnston that, unfortunately, the mentality of the Labor and Labor-Green governments that were inflicted on Tasmania for the past 16 years was a mendicant mentality. But the people of Tasmania have thrown themselves free of those shackles by electing a majority Liberal government, and today we Tasmanians, Senator Urquhart, are going to get the benefit of the first Liberal budget in 16 years.

                It might come as a surprise to the honourable senator—as we know that from her side when a government or party says, 'There will be no carbon tax,' it is a promise that will not be honoured. But when we on this side say that there will be no change to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
