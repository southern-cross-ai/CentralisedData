         I thank Senator Fawcett for the question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in all matters defence. The government has decided to commence the preparation and training of an Australian force to contribute to the international Building Partner Capacity mission in Iraq. This decision marks the next phase of Australia's contribution to the international coalition to disrupt, degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, or Daesh. It builds on the active contributions of our Air Task Group and Special Operations Task Group to international efforts to counter Daesh. This step is being taken following requests for our participation from both the Iraqi and United States governments. Working together, the Iraqi security forces and their coalition partners have stemmed Daesh's onslaught. Now, Iraq's security forces require international training support to conduct effective counteroffensive operations against Daesh and ultimately to take responsibility for their country's security.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian force will be based at Taji, north-west of Baghdad, and the mission is expected to commence in May this year. The government will consider the overall size and nature of Australia's commitment in Iraq in the second half of this year, taking into account the increasing focus of coalition efforts on building the capacity of Iraq's security forces. The government is working with Iraq, with the United States and, I especially remind the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         , with 60 coalition partners from around the world to help defeat this evilâ€”an evil that has seen people beheaded and people sold into sexual servitude. This is what we are fighting against and I call on all senators to support us.

           I can inform the Senate and Senator Fawcett that Australia is reluctant to reach out to faraway conflicts, but this terrorist violence has reached out to us. It must be resisted at home and abroad. Recent attacks in Australia and elsewhere around the world show that no country is immune from the threat of terrorism. There are at least 90 Australians fighting with Daesh and other terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria, and another 140 or so supporting these extremists. The Daesh cult is ideologically anti-Western and propagates a virulent anti-Western message. International efforts to disrupt and ultimately defeat Daesh are as much a matter of domestic security as a matter of international security. As part of a coalition of some 60 countries, Australia will be an important partner in the process.

             The Australian contribution is anticipated to include around 300 ADF personnel centred on a training team. The force would also comprise a substantial force protection element, along with command and support elements. The personnel to be prepared for this mission will be drawn largely from conventional army units within Australia. The proposed Australian

             force will train Iraqi army forces to improve their ability to conduct effective, independent offensive action against Daesh. This will include increasing the ability of Iraqi forces to coordinate operations, coordinate movement with fire support, provide logistics support and use intelligence effectively. The Australian force would work closely with personnel from the
