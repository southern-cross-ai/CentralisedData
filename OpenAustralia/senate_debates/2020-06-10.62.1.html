        My question is to the Minister for Women, Senator Payne. On Monday the government announced it was going to force parents to start paying some of the most expensive childcare fees in the world. When was the minister informed? Did anyone ask the minister's opinion about the impact on women?

           Women's workforce participation has dropped 50 per cent more than men's since COVID-19. Why does the Minister for Women believe that forcing more women out of the workforce through expensive childcare fees will help Australians recover from the first recession in 29 years?

            The senator can try to put words in my mouth, but she actually can't do it. She cannot assert that I said or believe something I did not say, so let's start with that. And then let's acknowledge—and you may not wish to, Senator

                Over 40 per cent of Australian families using child care have had at least one parent's income reduced as a consequence of COVID-19. Did the minister advocate for those families to her colleagues? What does the minister say to families who won't be able to afford child care after the government snaps back to the old high-fee system?

                 , and those opposite know that the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has required extraordinary things of Australia and of Australians. It has required the government to put in place a temporary childcare package, because we saw the sector facing unprecedented challenges that led it to the brink of collapse. Through those efforts we have ensured that the sector is able to continue functioning and that child care has been available for those who have needed it during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. But, because we have made some considerable achievements in flattening the curve, which we as a nation should be very proud of, we have the capacity to see our life and our economy returning to normal. The government will take considered steps in the response to that process as we need to to ensure that we can rebuild our economy and rebuild our country.
