        Demonising those who question the Left's radical gender ideology can have severe consequences. The lies and misinformation about the motivations of conservative parties, Christian organisations and women's rights groups who have challenged the Left on their gender politics are leading to hate and violence. We have seen it here in Australia, where peaceful pro-women events are being disrupted by aggressive counterprotesters looking for a fight. We even saw a radical racist Australian senator charge the podium of a peaceful gathering here in Canberra. There is no doubt this hatefulness contributed to the violent attack in New Zealand on a peaceful women's rights event.
       </p>
       <p>
        These lies increase the chance that very unwell people obsessed with gender ideology and confused about their own identity will commit violent acts as a way of retaliating against those they perceive as their oppressors. We have seen this in

        </a>
        and now with deadly consequences in the

        </a>
        . A 28-year-old female has committed a mass shooting targeting teachers and children. At least six deaths have been confirmed. The alleged shooter apparently self-identified as a man. The extreme Left say this sort of person needs compassion and gender-affirming care to reinforce their delusions. These hateful attacks against concerned conservatives, Christians and women's rights groups need to stop before we see more innocent people die. To ask a question or to seek an inquiry is an act of compassion, not prejudice. Let's stop the lies and hate and start asking questions so we can develop solutions that will work and help people in need.

           It enrages me almost beyond my ability to articulate that in 2023 the basic human rights of trans people still need to be asserted and reasserted and defended against those who would undermine them, those who would erase them and those who would blot them out of our community.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the week when the community was preparing for the Trans Day of Visibility in Australia, this effort by those who would erase the trans community took a very, very serious turn, as a notorious international transphobe toured this nation and many in this place sat and said nothing. In fact, some cheered them on. Some organised and facilitated the rallies and organised gatherings—shame!—while many in the community organised to push back, to stare these bigots down and to proclaim that in Australia love is love is love and that the trans community should be celebrated. With strength and unity, this community ensured that, in every single place this vile excuse for a human being and their supporters raised their heads, they were pushed back upon, and I am so glad to say that they were sent packing in New Zealand.

           will always fully and unwaveringly back the trans community, because trans human rights are non-negotiable.
