       <p class="italic">
        On 24 November 2014, the Senate referred the inquiry into the operation, regulation and funding of private vocational education and training (VET) providers in Australia to the Education and Employment References Committee (the Committee). The terms of reference are at Appendix A.

        scheme and safeguarding the quality of training more broadly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government shares the Committee's concerns around maintaining high quality standards of training provision in VET. The Australian Government continues to be committed to ensuring quality training and assessment outcomes for students. A range of initiatives to promote quality have been at the centre of the Australian Government's VET reform agenda.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These initiatives include the introduction of new Standards for

        s) in 2015, an enhanced regulatory approach for the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA), a focus on assessment reform, a mechanism to address emerging issues through the introduction of a regulation for making

        , the review of training packages, the reform of the training package development process and the establishment of the Australian Industry and Skills Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is aware of unscrupulous behaviour by some VET FEE-HELP providers. This is why we have announced the new VET Student Loans scheme which replaced VET FEE-HELP from 1 January 2017. VET Student Loans give students, providers and the VET sector the opportunity to better meet industry needs and employment outcomes while ensuring quality providers are delivering the program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new scheme will stop providers from charging students exorbitant fees which are then underwritten by the taxpayer. Australia's economic growth and business productivity will be enhanced by a strong VET system, and the VET Student Loans scheme is an important part of this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee, through the Australian Greens Senators' additional recommendations, has raised issues in relation to the impact of contestability in the training market, including the degree to which training subsidies are contestable between public and private RTOs, and whether additional financial support is provided to public providers (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        institutes).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports contestability as it promotes choice for students and encourages efficiency, responsiveness, and innovation among RTOs. Contestability is a core part of the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NA" rel="nofollow">
         NA
        </a>
        SWD) and the previous National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform (Skills Reform
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP" rel="nofollow">
         NP
        </a>
        ). In the NASWD, all governments committed to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         encourage responsiveness in training arrangements by facilitating the operation of a more open and competitive training market;
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         enable public providers to operate effectively in an environment of greater competition, recognising their important function in servicing the training needs of industry, regions and local communities, and their role that spans high level training and workforce development for industries and improved skill and job outcomes for disadvantaged learners and communities;
        </i>
        <i>
         1
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, this support for TAFE institutes to adapt to a more competitive training market should not be in conflict with, or at the expense of, contestability and provision of choice for consumers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government budgeted $1.85 billion to state and territory governments for their training systems in 2017-18, of which $1.5 billion will be through the National Skills and Workforce Development Specific Purpose Payment; and $350 million through the Skilling Australians Fund (the Fund) .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Fund will provide a new agreement with states and territories, superseding the funding and framework of the previous National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. The new partnership focuses on strong accountability, transparency and clear outcomes for skills training and the broader economy. With matched funding from the states and territories, the Fund will support up to 300,000 more apprentices, trainees, pre- and higher-level apprentices over the next four years. Spending from the Fund will be prioritised towards projects brought forward from states and territory governments which support apprenticeships and traineeships in: occupations in demand, industries and sectors of future growth, trade apprenticeships, rural and regional Australia, and industries facing structural adjustment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        States and territories manage the delivery of VET within their jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction decides how much funding to provide to their training system and how it should be spent. Training subsidy arrangements are also determined by state governments and include the degree to which training subsidies are contestable between public and private RTOs. Therefore, some aspects of the additional recommendations are outside the scope of the Australian Government's responsibilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Committee recommends that, given the evidence of rampant abuse, accelerating costs, and doubling of bad debt the government launches an immediate review into the operation and regulation of VET FEE-HELP.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Australian Government supports this recommendation

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>
         Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Act 2015
        </i>
        passed through Parliament in December 2015 and enacted new measures from 1 January 2016 to further strengthen the scheme. These changes controlled growth ahead of the replacement of VET FEE-HELP with VET Student Loans, which better reflects the nature and practice of the VET sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        VET Student Loans offer greater protections for students and provides access to quality higher level VET qualifications that address industry needs and create better opportunities for employment. VET Student Loans is underpinned by strong legislation and robust compliance measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Committee recommends that this review considers the most effective way to control costs of courses for students under VET FEE-HELP by either instituting a lower and separate loan limit or a cap on student loan amounts.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Australian Government supports this recommendation
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        VET Student Loans were introduced on 1 January 2017, replacing the VET FEE-HELP scheme. VET Student Loans offer greater protections for students and provide access to quality higher level VET qualifications that address industry needs and create better opportunities for employment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Loan caps apply to all eligible courses under VET Student Loans. There are three bands of loan caps of $5000, $10,000 and $15,000, which will apply irrespective of whether the course is being delivered face-to-face, online, or via mixed delivery modes. A separate loan cap of $75,000 for the aviation training package applies. The application of loan caps on all eligible courses is designed protect students from rapidly rising course costs, and puts downward pressure on fees.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The intent of loan caps is to protect students from rapidly rising course costs while still giving students the ability to choose a course based on a number of factors such as quality of delivery, course content, location and facilities. Therefore, establishing loan caps on courses does not prevent approved VET Student Loan providers from setting tuition fees above the cap, rather it sets a ceiling on the maximum loan amount the government is willing to provide a student for a specific course.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Committee further recommends that this review considers the most effective way to limit provider access to VET FEE-HELP so that only providers with the highest reputation for quality have unfettered access to the scheme. The Committee recommends that the government mandates minimum entry standards of year 12 completion or equivalent for access to VET FEE-HELP loans for Diploma level courses and above.

        <i>
         Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP Reform) Act 2015
        </i>
        introduced additional quality criteria for approval of new VET FEE-HELP providers. Only those registered training organisations (RTOs) that have a strong trading history of at least five years in offering VET courses are eligible to apply. The amendments also introduced minimum entry standards for students wishing to access VET FEE-HELP loans. From 1 January 2016, VET FEE-HELP providers were required to apply a student entry procedure for VET FEE-HELP loans.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The student entry procedure must specify that a student is academically suited to a course when the student satisfies one of the following requirements:

        VET Student Loans were introduced on 1 January 2017, replacing the VET FEE-HELP scheme. VET Student Loans offer greater protections for students and provide access to quality higher level VET qualifications that address industry needs and create better opportunities for employment.

        A new application process applies to providers who wish to access the VET Student Loans program, regardless of whether they were a provider under VET FEE-HELP. Under the new application approval process, providers will be assessed against a range of criteria including: financial performance, strong management and governance, applicants' relationships with industry, student outcomes, and the provider's three-year track record of delivering education and training.

        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Committee opposes suggestions to lower the repayment threshold to $30, 000 or $40,000. Asking lower income earners to pay for the failure of government to properly regulate the operations of VET FEE-HELP â€” and for the rampant and unethical misbehaviour of some private providers â€” fails both the practical and ethical test.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Australian Government notes this recommendation
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 15 September 2016 the Senate passed the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016. Among other measures the Bill establishes a new minimum repayment threshold for HELP debts of two per cent when a person's income reaches $51,957 in the 2018-19 financial year. This new threshold will apply to all HELP debts including VET FEE-HELP, as current policy settings do not differentiate between the different loan types in terms of repayment thresholds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        VET Student Loans were introduced on 1 January 2017, replacing the VET FEE-HELP scheme. VET Student Loans offer greater protections for students and provide access to quality higher level VET qualifications that address industry needs and create better opportunities for employment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ensuring cohesion between the shared elements of HELP is critical as a number of students move between higher education and VET throughout their education experience. Therefore, the current lifetime loan limit, repayment threshold and rates and the loan fee will apply to the new VET Student Loans scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Committee recommends that urgent and concerted efforts are made to further raise awareness of the rights of students and existing Standards relating to providers in the VET sector. This effort should focus on advocacy groups dealing with the most vulnerable members of the community, including the long-term unemployed or disadvantaged, migrants and people with disabilities.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Australian Government notes this recommendation
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to ensuring students are provided with accurate and accessible information about their rights as students and consumers. Transparent and accurate information about training provider services and performance enables prospective and current learners to make informed decisions regarding their training and assessment needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) 2015 (RTO Standards) make RTOs responsible for ensuring prospective students are well informed about their training. RTOs must provide students with clear information on matters including entry requirements, the mode of delivery and assessment, support services and any third party arrangements in place (Standard 5). Students must also be accurately informed about fees, funding entitlements and the terms of any loans they may incur (Standard 5). The Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) can take action against a RTO when it, or any marketing agent acting on its behalf, fails to provide clear information to prospective students.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Furthermore, the RTO Standards require that RTOs ensure their training strategies enable each learner to meet the requirements for each unit of competency, including giving regard to the existing skills, knowledge and experience of the learner. Where appropriate, the RTO should make reasonable adjustments to take into consideration the individual learner's needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In October 2014, the Australian Government announced a commitment of $68 million over four years to support ASQA in becoming a more modern and responsive regulator. This included funding for ASQA's communication strategy which made it clear to all RTOs that they are responsible for ensuring all members of the community are properly informed. Prior to the implementation of the new RTO Standards, ASQA consulted extensively with a range of stakeholders, including students. This included hosting 31 information sessions focused on the RTO Standards in 16 cities across Australia during October and November 2014.

        to make it an offence for any person to market a VET course without clearly identifying the RTO providing the qualification. This additional obligation ensures prospective students are better informed about which RTO they are dealing with.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        New legislation for VET Student Loans includes a range of measures to expand on the existing student protections by banning brokers or agents from engaging or recruiting students in relation to loans, prohibiting contact with students regarding the availability of

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to protecting students and supporting the integrity of the VET sector. The Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) 2015 (RTO Standards) support quality in the VET system by requiring that advertising and marketing material is accurate, comprehensive information is provided to prospective students and assessment strategies meet course requirements. Providers must at all times be compliant with the RTO Standards and the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) takes appropriate regulatory action against any provider found to be non-compliant.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since its establishment in 2011, ASQA's regulatory decisions have affected a significant number of training providers nationally. As at 30 June 2016, ASQA had issued 595 written notices of intention to cancel or suspend registration and actually made 315 decisions to cancel or suspend registration. It had also refused 187 applications to renew registration from existing RTOs.2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ASQA employs a modern, responsive, risk-based approach to regulation. This involves applying greater scrutiny to high-risk providers and prioritising the issues that pose a serious risk to safety and the integrity of the VET sector. This targeted approach also ensures high quality, low risk providers who are doing the right thing are not subject to unnecessary regulatory burden.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A sector-wide process would divert ASQA's resources away from more targeted scrutiny of high risk providers while placing unnecessary scrutiny on compliant providers. ASQA's risk analysis is based on intelligence it captures from a wide range of sources including student complaints, audit findings and employer and industry advice. ASQA uses intelligence and data analytics to evaluate information and identify those risks that present the greatest threat to quality outcomes for the VET sector. This analysis of risk includes examining trends in enrolment data and levels of government funding. Data that suggests a provider may be employing aggressive sales or student recruitment strategies would trigger closer scrutiny from ASQA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has introduced tough new standards for RTOs that will enable regulators to act more swiftly when addressing quality concerns. The department will work with ASQA to reinforce increased VET Student Loans provider compliance and quality through infringements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2016, the department undertook a range of VET FEE-HELP compliance actions, including an initial 28 provider audits. The audits have provided an evidence base for compliance action, including suspending the approval of seven providers for poor performance. The department is continuing its audit work in 2017, including new audits on providers not previously audited. Based on the audit findings, the department is withholding VET FEE-HELP payments from a number of providers, including Phoenix Institute of Australia and conducting investigations into the veracity of their reported enrolments.

These investigations may also result in compliance action by the department, including infringement notices and possible civil penalty proceedings. As of 1 August 2017, five providers have paid a total of 59 infringement notices (totaling $637,200) for alleged breaches of civil penalty provisions within HESA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For those providers with multiple serious breaches, the department has the power to revoke their VET FEE-HELP approval. Since 2015, the department has revoked the VET FEE-HELP approval of 11 providers for non-compliance with HESA, including Phoenix Institute of Australia and the Australian Institute of Professional Education (AIPE).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These efforts will continue under the new VET Student Loans programâ€”which replaced VET FEE-HELP on 1 January 2017, with infringements being broadened and strengthened under the program.

        (NVETR Act). Certain provisions of the NVETR Act create offences and civil penalties that apply to any person, not only registered training organisations (RTOs). For example, the legislation gives ASQA the power to take action against a person operating within the VET sector who makes a false or misleading representation relating to a VET course, which would apply to brokers or marketing agents found to be making such statements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 2 April 2015, ASQA has also been able to issue infringement notices for breaches of certain civil penalty provisions under the NVETR Act. This allows ASQA to quickly resolve some clear-cut breaches of the legislation by issuing a fine to either an RTO or a third party.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Students' interests are protected in the VET sector by a range of mechanisms. All training providers, as well as third party brokers or marketing agents, must comply with the consumer law that applies in the relevant jurisdiction and the Australian Consumer Law, which is enforced jointly by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and State and Territory regulators.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The powers referred by the states which form the basis of the NVETR Act may not extend to the specific regulation of brokers or marketing conduct in the VET sector. A further referral of powers by the states to the Commonwealth may be required to allow ASQA to more comprehensively regulate brokers or marketing agents.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Powers in relation to student advocacy or protection were specifically excluded from the referral of powers by the states and territories to the Commonwealth under the NVETR Act.

        Under the
        <i>
         National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011,
        </i>
        all registered training organisations (RTOs) (including VET FEE-HELP providers) must comply with the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). The AQF provides guidance on the 'typical' volume of learning for each qualification type, which allows flexibility. Those developing and accrediting qualifications are responsible for exercising professional judgement to ensure courses enable students to achieve the learning outcomes for the qualification type and the discipline, and must also comply with the AQF.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is a tension between mandated minimums for course duration and the national VET system's competency-based approach to training. What is critical is not the number of hours studied, but rather that the course provides each student with sufficient opportunity to gain the competencies of the module or qualification. Different students are at different stages in the development of their competencies and recognising the prior learning of students is an important component of the VET system. Courses may be structured for completion in a shorter period where a training organisation can clearly describe how learners have the characteristics to achieve the required rigour and depth of training in a shorter period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Standards for RTOs 2015 (the Standards) require providers to give regard to the existing skills, knowledge and experience of the learner, and the mode of delivery, when determining the necessary amount of training provided. If an RTO is unable to demonstrate how the amount of training provided enables the learner to achieve the required competencies, ASQA may take an appropriate regulatory response.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government will continue to monitor the regulatory architecture relating to course duration to ensure regulatory oversight is adequate and that providers comply with the Standards.

These escalate from conditions on registration through to suspending or cancelling a provider's registration. For violations of certain provisions of the NVETR Act, ASQA can seek a civil penalty order or criminal sanctions from the courts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 2 April 2015, registered training organisations that breach certain civil penalty provisions in the NVETR Act can also be fined directly by ASQA under a new infringement notice scheme. This allows ASQA to quickly resolve some clear cut breaches of the legislation. Penalties for fines range from a couple of thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars for a single breach, and for multiple breaches there is the potential for the ultimate fine to be hundreds of thousands of dollars.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is open to exploring whether the legislative framework could be improved by enhancing ASQA's ability to take swift regulatory action against RTOs delivering inadequate training or assessment, particularly where the RTO is a repeat offender. The Australian Government is, however, cognisant of the need to ensure ASQA's powers are consistent with procedural fairness and appropriate review rights for training providers. Possible improvements to the framework are being explored as part of various streams of ongoing work.

The new Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) 2015 (the Standards), that were introduced from 1 January 2015, strengthen consumer protection in the VET sector by increasing RTOs' obligations relating to information provided to students. In particular, the Standards make RTOs responsible for the conduct of any third parties operating on their behalf, and strengthen requirements around marketing of training and the information provided to students, including clear information about any income contingent loans, government funded subsidies or other financial arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2015, the Australian Government established a National Training Complaints Hotline to streamline and simplify the reporting of complaints by training consumers and to help authorities deal with poor quality providers.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hotline" rel="nofollow">
         The Hotline

        directs student complaints to the appropriate Commonwealth, state or territory organisation for help and provides evidence to governments to inform policy development.

       <p class="italic">
        ASQA has established a dedicated working group with the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training (the department) to continue sharing data and other intelligence information on areas of current and emerging risk. As part of this arrangement, ASQA and the department are collaborating to pool information, protect the provision of quality VET, improve quality outcomes for learners and strengthen the administration of public monies. The shared information has allowed ASQA and the department to develop a more sophisticated understanding of providers and has assisted in identifying those providers which are of greatest concern. ASQA is using the information as part of its regulatory strategy to target providers which demonstrate concerning behaviour.

        The Australian Government supports contestability in training markets as it promotes student choice and encourages efficiency, responsiveness and innovation among registered training organisations (RTOs). Contestability is a core part of the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development (NASWD) and the previous National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform (Skills Reform NP). In the NASWD, all governments committed to:

        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, this support for TAFE institutes to adapt to a more competitive training market should not be in conflict with, or at the expense of, contestability and provision of choice for consumers. Contestability is a reform element of the Skills Reform NP that has been implemented allowing for jurisdictional flexibility with outcomes intended to improve accessibility, equity, transparency, efficiency and responsiveness of training. This flexibility has resulted in eight distinct systems that have been tailored, and continue to be refined, based on jurisdictional differences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government budgeted $1.8 billion to state and territory governments for their training systems in 2017-18, of which $1.5 billion is through the National Skills and Workforce Development Specific Purpose Payment and $350 million through the Skilling Australians Fund (the Fund). States and territories manage the main subsidy systems for VET within their jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over 2017-18 to 2020-21, the Commonwealth will commit an estimated $1.5 billion to the new and ongoing Skilling Australians Fund (the Fund). With matched funding from the states and territories, the Fund will support up to 300,000 more apprentices, trainees, pre- and higher-level apprentices over the next four years. Spending from the Fund will be prioritised towards projects brought forward from states and territory governments which support apprenticeships and traineeships in: occupations in demand, industries and sectors of future growth, trade apprenticeships, rural and regional Australia, and industries facing structural adjustment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new partnership focuses on strong accountability, transparency and clear outcomes for skills training and the broader economy. All project proposals will need to demonstrate engagement with, and support from employers and industry. Payments to states will require the signing of the new agreement, agreeing to projects with clear milestones and the states demonstrating achievement of those milestones.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Each jurisdiction decides how much funding to provide to their training system and how it should be spent. Therefore, some aspects of the additional recommendations are outside the scope of the Australian Government's responsibilities.

        Additional Recommendation 2

       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Capping funding to private RTOs to ensure the primacy of public education. If the contestability model remains, the proportion of funds allocated contestably should be capped at 15%, with TAFE guaranteed secure access to at least 85% of all funds allocated to each course code. No private provider should be funded for any course that TAFE can provide. This will at least shield TAFE from the worst aspects of contestability and ensure some stability for the sector.

        The Australian Government supports contestability in training markets as it promotes student choice and encourages efficiency, responsiveness, and innovation among registered training organisations (RTOs).

         Banning brokers to reduce perverse incentives. While the Committee's majority report recommends the government cap or otherwise regulate the level of fees paid to brokers at a maximum of 15% of the loan, this will not remove the perverse incentive for brokers to act . against the interests of the potential student. Regardless of the payment system, the whole practice of brokering exacerbates the tension between profit maximisation and student interests that private providers already have difficulty negotiating.

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is determined to stamp out unscrupulous sales practices in the VET sector, whether carried out by rogue brokers or persons employed directly by registered training organisations (RTOs). The Australian Government is focusing on ensuring existing prohibitions against this conduct are effectively enforced and these practices are eradicated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Students' interests are currently protected in a range of ways. Australian Consumer Law prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct by any person carrying on a business in the VET sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Making a misleading representation about a VET qualification is also prohibited under the
        <i>
         National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011
        </i>
        (NVETR Act) and a range of civil and criminal penalties may apply to any person who breaches this obligation. The Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) is also able to issue a fine for anyone violating certain provisions of the NVETR Act under the new infringement notice scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The contract for the delivery of training is between the RTO and the student. Accordingly, the RTO must be ultimately responsible for the conduct of its employees and any third parties dealing directly with prospective students. RTOs are held accountable for this conduct under the Standards for RTOs 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        VET Student Loans were introduced from 1 January 2017â€”replacing the VET FEE-HELP scheme. Under VET Student Loans, third party delivery of training will only be allowed in circumstances where the third party is also an approved VET Student Loan provider or accredited with the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency (TEQSA). Providers will be prohibited from using brokers or marketing agents to interact or engage with students at enrolment or any other time throughout their training.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government welcomes the report by the Committee. The Committee released its report Technical and Further Education in Australia on 14 May 2014. The report made 10 recommendations. Coalition Senators made a dissenting report with amendments to two recommendations (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommendations" rel="nofollow">
         Recommendations
        </a>
        1 and 6) in the majority report. The Coalition Senators did not support Recommendation 10 in its entirety and proposed an additional recommendation. Australian Greens Senators provided additional comments and made six additional recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has considered the Committee's report and provides a response to each of the 10 recommendations individually, or against a group of recommendations where appropriate. The Australian Government also responds to the amended recommendations and alternative recommendation from the Coalition Senators, and the additional recommendations from the Australian Greens Senators.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government recognises and supports the important role played by public providers (referred to as TAFE institutes) in the broader vocational education and training (VET) sector. In 2016, approximately 52 per cent (660, 400) of all Government subsidised VET students were enrolled at a TAFE or other government provider.' TAFE plays an important role in providing training to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and in rural and regional areas. The Australian Government notes that the Committee's report highlights some of these important roles and the significance of TAFE in the provision of high quality training that delivers workers with the skills needed by industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the tabling of this report, the Australian Government now has the benefit of Total VET Activity (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVA" rel="nofollow">
         TVA
        </a>
        ) data from 2014, 2015 and 2016 including information about unsubsidised training at private providers. The 2016 TVA data shows students choose a variety of training providers: around 2.5 million (58.7 per cent) were attending private training providers; around 740, 000 (17.6 per cent) were attending TAFE institutions and the remainder undertook VET with community education providers and with schools, enterprise providers and universities.2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of the recommendations of the report are outside the scope of the Australian Government as states and territories manage the delivery of VET within their jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        States and territories ensure the effective operation of the subsidised training market in their jurisdiction. As part of this, each jurisdiction decides how much funding to provide to their training system and how it should be spent, including the proportion of funds provided to public providers (TAFE institutes), the role of public providers in their state system and the degree to which training subsidies are contestable between public and private RTOs. Fees for students are set by state governments or registered training organisations (RTOs), depending on the jurisdiction.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        States and territories have historically provided approximately two thirds of government funding for subsidised training. However, the

       <p class="italic">
        The Government will spend approximately $3.1 billion on VET in 2017-18. This includes $1.85 billion in payments to states and territories for the operation of their training systems and $1.2 billion for the Government's own programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From 2017-18 to 2020-21, the Commonwealth will commit an estimated $1.5 billion to the new and ongoing Skilling Australians Fund (the Fund). The Fund is for payments to the states and territories through a new partnership agreement. With matched funding from the states and territories, the Fund will support up to 300,000 more apprentices, trainees, pre- and higher-level apprentices over the next four years. Spending from the Fund will be prioritised towards projects brought forward from states and territory governments which support apprenticeships and traineeships in: occupations in demand, industries and sectors of future growth, trade apprenticeships, rural and regional Australia, and industries facing structural adjustment.

        Australian Government financial support to TAFE institutes includes income contingent loans to TAFE students, both full fee-paying and state subsidised students, studying at or above Diploma level. On 1 January 2017, VET Student Loans commenced, replacing VET FEE-HELP. TAFEs that were provisionally approved as VET student loans approved course providers were able to commence operating under VET Student Loans from 1 January 2017 and were granted an approval period of seven years. Additionally, the Government

        These commitments to greater contestability in training subsidies between public and private providers continue earlier market-like approaches to the national training market.

        The Skilling Australians Fund will provide a new agreement with states and territories, superseding the funding and framework of the previous National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. The new partnership focuses on strong accountability, transparency and clear outcomes for skills training and the broader economy. With matched funding from the states and territories, the Fund will support up to 300,000 more apprentices, trainees, pre- and higher-level apprentices over the next four years.

       <p class="italic">
        The Fund will be prioritised towards projects brought forward from states and territory governments which support apprenticeships and traineeships in the following key areas: occupations in demand, industries and sectors of future growth, trade apprenticeships, rural and regional areas and industries experiencing structural adjustment. The projects may also focus on a range of priority industries, including: tourism, hospitality, health and aged care, engineering, building and construction, agriculture, manufacturing and digital technologies.

       <p class="italic">
        All project proposals will need to demonstrate engagement with, and support from, employers and industry. Payments to states will require the signing of the new agreement, agreeing to projects with clear milestones and the states demonstrating achievement of those milestones.

        The Australian Government believes the commitment made as part of the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development (NASWD) in 2012 provides a clear statement of policy direction on the role of TAFE. As part of the NASWD, COAG identified a number of policy reform directions for the national training system. In particular, all governments committed to:

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government also acknowledges the part quality private registered training organisations play in the Australian VET system and the role they can play supporting industry and other consumers in a competitive training environment.

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to lifting the quality of Australia's VET system to ensure training delivers to students the skills they need for real jobs in the modern economy.

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government recognises that it is industry and employers who should be driving the nation's training system, as their knowledge and input is crucial to ensuring that skills standards and competencies align with modern work-practices. Developing a more dynamic approach to industry engagement will facilitate a more flexible training system capable of meeting the current and emerging skill needs of employers, of all sizes and across all industry sectors.

The NDIS provides funding for long-term, individualised care and support that is reasonable and necessary to meet the needs of people with permanent disability, where a person's disability significantly affects their communication, mobility, self-care or self-management. The scheme takes a lifelong approach to providing care and support. In 2019-20, the scheme will assist around 460,000 Australians, costing governments approximately $21 billion.

In November 2015, skills ministers agreed to national actions including developing new indicators and measures, revising survey instruments and increasing consumer access to information, including on the My Skills website. Work in this area is designed to minimise additional impact on training providers.

        Loan caps apply to all eligible courses under VET Student Loans. There are three bands of loan caps of $5000, $10,000 and $15,000, which apply irrespective of whether the course is being delivered face-to-face, online, or via mixed delivery modes. A separate loan cap of $75,000 for the aviation training package applies. The application of loan caps on all eligible courses is designed to protect students from rapidly rising course costs, and put downward pressure on fees.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The intent of loan caps is to protect students from rapidly rising course costs while still giving students the ability to choose a course based on a number of factors such as quality of delivery, course content, location and facilities. Therefore, loan caps on courses does not prevent approved VET Student Loan providers from setting tuition fees above the cap, rather it sets a ceiling on the maximum loan amount the government is willing to provide a student for a specific course.

        State and territory governments have responsibility for running their own training systems. The VET sector is populated by a variety of training providers, TAFE institutes, schools, not for profit and privately owned RTOs and some universities. Each plays an important role in providing quality training outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In recent years, the states have, to varying degrees, introduced more demand driven approaches to the public funding of training delivery. These changes have occurred for a range of reasons. In some cases, this has resulted in reductions in the level of funding some TAFE institutes receive from states and territories.

        As part of NASWD, states and territories are committed to considering strategies for supporting TAFE to operate as part of a contestable funding market.

       <p class="italic">
        Ultimately, the focus should always be on ensuring students and users of the VET system have a choice of quality training offerings, regardless of the training provider. Training should improve an individual's chances of getting a job and progressing their career.

        The Australian Government is considering the regulatory architecture in relation to duration of learning in a competency based system to ensure that regulatory oversight is adequate. In particular, it is committed to ensuring effective regulatory oversight of registered training organisations (RTO) compliance with the Standards for RTOs. Specifically, Standard 1.1 requires RTO training and assessment strategies and practices to have regard to the amount of training required for the learner to gain the competencies as specified in the relevant training package or VET accredited course.
