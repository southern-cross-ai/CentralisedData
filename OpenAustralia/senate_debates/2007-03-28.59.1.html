          I thank the senator for the question and note his longstanding interest in Indigenous affairs, particularly in his home state of Queensland. This government has a proud history of long-term policies for creating economic activity as well as policies that ensure the capacity for Indigenous individuals and communities to capitalise on the wonderful economic boom that the great management of the economy by this government has created. This policy has been widely embraced by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Indigenous Australia
          </a>
          ns, who share our belief that all Australians should get equitable access to the benefits of this economy. Whilst we respect cultural practices and we support the symbolic actions of other policies, our main focus has to be on practical measures. The symbolic gestures are no help to those people without jobs, adequate housing, adequate access to medical facilities and access to other opportunities.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is such a pity that Labor fought the government at almost every turn on the implementation of these policies and the legislative changes that came behind them. However, I think credit should be given where credit is due. I noticed some comments from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Macklin" rel="nofollow">
           Jenny Macklin
          </a>
          , the opposition spokesperson on Indigenous affairs, recently and I commend the Labor Party for the turn that appears to have occurred in their Indigenous policy. I say that with some confidence—the turn has come. They simply looked around and could not find their own policies so they have seized upon ours—practical reconciliation. I understand the depoliticising—

            When I stood up to answer this question the Leader of the Opposition interjected, ‘I hope you are not going to politicise it, Senator.’ I am certainly not doing so. The point I am making is that if you are going to move fundamentally towards our policies you cannot just leave out some important aspects of them because of some political notions.

                         I thank the senator for the supplementary. The philosophy that, for some reason or other, we need to have some differential in the politics of looking after

                         ns I think is a pretty cynical approach. The symbolism of saying, ‘Let’s have another Indigenous body that somehow is representative of

                         ,’ simply to have some sort of cynical differential for some political purpose is not having the interests of the Indigenous Australians at heart. I call on the other side simply to completely embrace the policies of this government and get on with the job of representing the best interests of Indigenous Australia.
