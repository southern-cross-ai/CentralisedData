        One of my jobs before I entered the Senate was as a training coordinator for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Services Union
        </a>
        . I also sat as a branch representative on two industry skills councils. These were a great forum for representatives of employers, employees, training providers and government to get together to identify areas of skills needs and how to address them. Sadly, the industry skills councils were abolished by the previous government, who seriously dropped the ball when it came to training Australians to fill areas of skills shortage. While our skilled migration program is an important measure for filling these gaps, it should only be a last resort.
       </p>
       <p>
        The COVID pandemic highlighted how ill-equipped we were to address skills shortages within our domestic workforce. Labor committed to tackling the skills crisis, which was brought about by the previous government's neglect. A centrepiece of our work is the landmark five-year national skills agreement entered into with the states and territories. This agreement aligns the strategic priorities of states and territories, investing over $30 billion including $12.6 billion from the Australian government. Included in our funding commitment is $2.4 billion to support the states and territories to deliver skills for critical and emerging industries including clean energy, advanced manufacturing, care services and digital technology. There are also commitments to a strengthened

        sector supporting students from diverse backgrounds and closing the gap. New investments under the agreement are in addition to our commitment to deliver 300,000 fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        places from 2024.
       </p>
       <p>
        In almost a decade in power, the previous government failed to land a skills agreement with any of the states or territories. The skills landscape was the

        under the previous government. It was dominated by cuts, deregulation and short-term thinking. Finally, Australia has a government that puts our long-term skills needs front and centre.

        In the last couple of minutes that I have tonight, I would like to speak briefly about Ukraine, especially in support for Ukraine. I do find it really disappointing that there are some in this place who have chosen to politicise the issue of Australia's support for Ukraine. It's important to put some facts on the table about Australia's commitment to Ukraine, which remains bipartisan, strong and unwavering. Since coming to office last year, the Albanese government has more than doubled the military contribution to Ukraine. The Australian government has committed more than $910 million to Ukraine, including more than $730 million in military assistance. We are one of the largest non-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
         NATO
        </a>
        military contributors. In addition to the 120 Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles already provided, a Royal Australian Air Force E-7A Wedgetail aircraft has recently deployed to Germany with 100 ADF personnel to protect the gateway of humanitarian aid and military assistance to Ukraine. In total, we have committed 218 vehicles, including 120 Bushmasters, as well as our anti-armour weapons, uncrewed aerial systems, critical 105-millimetre ammunition and one E-7A Wedgetail aircraft.
       </p>

        The third rotation of 70

        personnel have recently finished training Ukrainian recruits in weapons handling and firing, rural and urban fighting, trench warfare and medical survival skills. This means Australia has now trained 1,150 Ukrainian defenders. However, we recognise, that the people of Ukraine do not just need military support. In a stark reminder of the critical importance of mental health support in Ukraine, this week, Senator Reynolds and I were honoured to host seven incredible brave Ukrainian mental health workers who are in Sydney for three months to undertake training in trauma management. The group consisted of four psychiatrists and three psychologists, who were able to come to Australia thanks to Australian fellowships bestowed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        . Despite the time difference, these people continue to do their work in Kyiv and Lviv through digital platforms, so they're learning about trauma support and still doing their workâ€”that's commitment to the people of Ukraine and an amazing work ethic. Under the most tragic and devastating consequences of war is the toll it takes on mental health, not only for soldiers but civilians as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        As one Ukrainian mental health worker pointed out: 'The entire nation of Ukraine is now suffering from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
         PTSD
        </a>
        as a result of this abhorrent war. But if we can restore the people, we will restore our nation.'
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the $10 million contribution to the Ukrainian Humanitarian Fund announced by Australia in late June, I'm proud to be part of a government that continues to explore new ways to help heal and restore the lives of so many victims of Russia's brutal invasion.
