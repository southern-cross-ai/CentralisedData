        Over the weekend in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        we saw yet another example of how Australians have had enough of Liberal governments. They have had enough of the excuses, the scandals, the boring talking points and the deliberate attempts to divide us as a nation over issues that should unite us.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is probably not the best idea for me to be giving pointers to those opposite on how to connect with everyday Australians, but, even after only 10 months in government watching my incredible Labor colleagues, I think there is one attribute that stands out: Australians want their elected representatives to be honest about the challenges we are facing but also to show a pathway to a better future. That is exactly what the Albanese government is doing by taking real action on climate change, getting wages moving again, delivering fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        to create a skilled workforce for the future and tackling the cost of living with cheaper medicine and early childhood education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luckily, with the upcoming referendum to establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to parliament, there is an opportunity for everyone, regardless of political party, to show Australians that they are open to change and they are ready to restore justice and walk hand in hand with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        people on our journey towards healing and reconciliation. We are proud to support the Uluru statement, voice, truth and treaty. I call on

        to get off the fence and support the Voice, because this should be above politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        A huge congratulations to Chris Minns, New South Wales Labor and all the incredible Labor volunteers who have made this possible. We wouldn't be here without you.

         I just remind you that you need to refer to people from the other place by their correct title.
