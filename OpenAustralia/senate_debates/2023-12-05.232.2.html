        I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023. Due to the routine of business today, I didn't, like others, have the opportunity to make a summing-up speech in the usual way. I want to take the opportunity now to place certain matters before the Senate and acknowledge the debate that has occurred so far, and I thank senators for their contributions.

        This bill supports the operation of the nature repair market being established under the Nature Repair Market Bill. The bill will make it easier for businesses and philanthropic organisations to invest in reversing environmental decline and repairing and restoring nature. This bill will amend the Clean Energy Regulator Act to enable the Clean Energy Regulator to effectively regulate the nature repair market. This includes allowing for members of the regulator to have relevant experience in the market. This bill will also amend the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act to allow the nature repair market to utilise the expertise of qualified and experienced auditors, ensuring integrity in the delivery of biodiversity projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister Plibersek has worked closely with Minister Bowen, the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy, and they are committed to a nature repair market with integrity and transparency. This includes ensuring that the Clean Energy Regulator is resourced in operating to deliver its regulatory functions efficiently and effectively. The Clean Energy Regulator will be able to delegate its powers to staff within the environment department. This will ensure that the regular has access to the best expertise available for its regulatory powers and functions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier today, I circulated government amendments to the bill. These amendments will amend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
        </a>
        1999 to expand the water trigger to cover unconventional gas developments. Before the election Labor promised to do this, and we are delivering. This is a commonsense change. It provides business with certainty, and it provides the community with confidence that water resources and our environment are properly regulated and protected. The update will expand the water trigger to include other types of unconventional gas projects, such as shale gas projects, which are emerging as a potential new use of fracking in Australia. Most new gas projects will be unaffected by the change as coal seam gas production is already covered by the existing water trigger, and the trigger does not apply to conventional gas production.
       </p>
       <p>
        The transitional arrangements will provide certainty for business and ensure continuity of gas supply. Existing gas projects that are in commercial operation and already have a Commonwealth, state or territory approval are unaffected by the new laws. For clarity, a project is not in commercial operation merely because it is in the planning, exploration or appraisal phase, irrespective of any sale of gas from this precommercial activity. Projects regulated by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, will also be unaffected by this update. The water trigger will also not apply to projects that have already been through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC
        </a>
        Act approval process. The water trigger will apply to all unconventional gas production that has a significant impact on water resources. This includes all activities associated with the different phases of the production process, including exploration, appraisal, extraction, recovery or intentional release of gas, whether by drilling, hydraulic fracturing or other means.
       </p>
       <p>
        The expansion of the water trigger has been an important issue for

Water has important cultural value, and First Nations communities are rightly concerned to protect this value as well. We will keep working with First Nations on this as we implement these laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications held an inquiry into the bill, which included public hearings and the receipt of written submissions. The committee's report was released on 4 December. The committee made one recommendation, which is that both the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 and the Nature Repair Market (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023 be passed, and the government accepts this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I conclude by indicating that we are delighted to have received support from many members of the crossbench for an update to the water trigger. We are grateful for their willingness to support the government pursuing this alongside this other important government initiative, the nature repair market. We have agreed to support a number of amendments proposed by the Greensâ€”principally, amendments to prevent biodiversity certificates being used as environmental offsets and to remove references to offsets from the bill and an amendment to change the name of the bill. We, of course, appreciate the conversations we have with the crossbench every day on delivering our commitments, and that includes the conversations we've had about the nature repair market and expanding the water trigger. I thank senators again for their contributions. I commend the bills to the Senate.

         I appreciate that outline from the minister about where we're at now. It sort of broadly lines up with the coalition's understanding of the rushed and botched process off the back of a fairly protracted committee process.
        </p>
        <p>
         To that end, I'll go back to the supplementary explanatory memorandum that's been tabled by the government in relation to the consequential amendments. The minister talked about having worked closely with Minister Bowen and other entities. I presume the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         were in there. I'm trying to understand what has been proposed here. We have the backdrop of the cost-of-living crisis that this country is engulfed in at the moment. The people who frequent the public gallery to observe debate here are probably disappointed. Lack of supply has an impact on the price of gas. We talk about certainty about what will be provided as a result of this bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         The water trigger that we are being asked to pass with an hour and five minutes of debate remaining was only tabled at 5.52, less than two hours ago. I'm wondering what consultation has occurred with industry. I know we get derided by the Australian Greens political party for talking about thatâ€”
        </p>
        <p>
         given, as Senator Scarr points out by way of interjections, the jobs they create and the resources they provide to the economy. As far as I can recall from the committee hearings I attended and the evidence I read, this was not actually contemplated by the Senate committee. What consultation was undertaken with industry about these consequential amendments that were moved by way of very vague motion? Which projects does the government know will be caught up and what modelling has been undertaken around the impact of the passage of these extraneous amendments?

          I see that Senator Hanson-Young is on her feet, so, given the time, I will keep my remarks brief. The minister and her office have spoken with a range of affected and interested businesses and other organisations, as you'd expect with this kind of legislative reform. You ask about impacts on gas prices. This change will not impact existing gas projects whatsoever. What the changes do is keep pace with changing technology. Shale gas fracking was not on the cards when the water trigger was introduced in 2013. If it had been, it would logically have been included in the definition. The changes simply ensure that there is a level playing field for all unconventional gas projects that have the potential to have significant impacts on water. This was a change that we committed to at the election. Industry have had plenty of time to prepare for this change, and importantly, these changes will give the community confidence that the impacts of unconventional gas production and water resources will be properly regulated by the Commonwealth.

           Australians are sick of the greenwashing and the greed of big corporations wrecking our environment and fuelling climate change. That is why today the Greens have secured major reforms in this piece of legislation, to protect our waterways from fracking and our wildlife from big developers intent on destroying habitat.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
            The Greens
           </a>
           have secured an agreement from the government to drop dodgy offsets from their nature repair scheme. We have ensured the passage of an expanded water trigger in our environment laws before the end of the year, which we know is crucial, to force fracking projects to undergo environmental assessment for their impact on water, which is owned by all Australians. These significant environmental reforms will go a long way to protecting nature and climate from greenwashed destruction and dangerous fracking.
          </p>
          <p>
           The inclusion of offsets in a scheme to protect nature was a red flag to begin with and was a key concern raised by the Greens, the environment sector and many others around the country. Allowing corporations to pay to destroy nature is not nature positive. An offset scheme would not save our wildlife but would greenwash the expansion of habitat destruction for fossil fuels, logging and big development, which harm our environment. Scrapping these controversial offsets is key to ensuring that this scheme will not allow greenwashing and will not supercharge the destruction of nature.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Greens' amendment, agreed to by the government, will explicitly ensure that no biodiversity credits generated under the scheme can be used for offsetting. This will ensure that this nature repair scheme is truly a voluntary biodiversity accreditation scheme. This can facilitate private investment in nature to work alongside the much-needed government investment in biodiversity to help protect and restore nature. That is going to be a job still to do.
          </p>
          <p>
           This scheme can help unlock private land to facilitate biodiversity restoration and allow groups like farmers or
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           communities to undertake projects to restore wildlife biodiversity and habitat in their area. First Nations communities must be at the forefront of nature protection and restoration. It is critical that this scheme prioritise engagement with First Nations communities to cooperate on potential projects. Indigenous led land management is the most effective and efficient means by which to improve biodiversity outcomes, and this amended scheme can help facilitate that. Protection and restoration projects that work to ensure additional biodiversity outcomes are critical to targets like achieving zero extinctions and protecting 30 per cent of land and sea by 2030. By excluding offsetsâ€”banning offsets, dumping offsetsâ€”and stopping these projects from being used to justify disruption elsewhere, this scheme really could help work towards those targets.
          </p>
          <p>
           This scheme does not and cannot replace government investment and leadership in biodiversity protection and restoration. Critically, the Greens have also received a commitment from the government to regularly publish investment strategies to guide this biodiversity accreditation scheme and any priority projects. By scrapping dodgy offsets, the Greens have successfully stopped this scheme from becoming greenwashing destruction. Instead, it will now facilitate private investment in real, accredited biodiversity restoration that is good for the environment. Dumping offsets was always an important part of winning Greens support for this legislation. We fought hard for it and tonight we will deliver it.
          </p>
          <p>
           As part of this agreement, the Greens have also secured agreement that an expanded water trigger will pass into law by the end of this year. This will close the loophole which currently gives gas fracking corporations a licence to drill without there being any federal environmental water assessment. Currently, the Minister for the Environment and Water is required to assess only proposed coal seam gas projects for their water impact. Hydraulic fracturing projects remain exempt from this requirement despite their significant impact on water. Clearly, this is wrong and out-of-date and needs fixing. Today, after months of campaigning and negotiating, the Greens will ensure this is fixed. This water trigger will cover all phases of unconventional gas development, including exploration, appraisal and production. It will provide critical protection for Australia's rivers, aquifers and wetlands and the communities that rely on them. It will ensure that climate bombs like the Beetaloo basin must be assessed; that they can't just go ahead without any national oversight. It will throw a lifeline to water resources like the mighty

            Roper River
           </a>
           in the

            Northern Territory
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Fracking uses enormous volumes of water and puts ground and surface water at risk of contamination. This extended water trigger will ensure the minister is required to undertake rigorous assessment of these projects and their impacts on critical water resources. The Greens, alongside many environmental and First Nations groups, have worked tirelessly to ensure this trigger is extended to cover destructive fracking projects. I want to thank in particular the delegation of traditional owners from the Northern Territory who visited parliament earlier this year to tell us about the impacts of fracking on their country. They said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We know this planned gas fracking will make climate change worse. We know if this fracking goes ahead we may not be able to live on country like we have for thousands and thousands of years. We need your help to keep our culture, our water, our climate and our children's futures safe.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our water, our land and our climate are all linked. These new environmental protections are critical in recognising this and protecting water resources into the future from the impacts of dangerous fracking. This is a hit on gas fracking corporations in places like the Beetaloo and the Kimberley. Closing the fracking loophole via the water trigger will mean gas companies will no longer be able to bypass Australia's environment laws, and fossil fuel companies will not be let off the hook for wrecking waterways and our climate.
          </p>
          <p>
           After months of pressure and negotiation, the Albanese government has listened to the Greens' calls to deliver significant environmental reforms to protect nature and the climate from greenwashed habitat destruction and dangerous frackingâ€”gas fracking. Scrapping the dodgy offsets that would facilitate the destruction of nature is critical to ensuring biodiversity investment that is additional and has integrity. Ensuring that damaging projects undergo environmental assessment is also critical for protecting biodiversity and our climate and communities. I want to thank the crossbenchers who will support these amendments that will be moved by the Greens and those we have negotiated with the government. I also want to thank
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_McCarthy" rel="nofollow">

           in this place, who I know is very passionate about the water trigger in particular. I also want to thank Dr Sophie Scamps in the other place, who has fought hard to have this water trigger put in place as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many, many Australians have long argued for an expanded water triggerâ€”and tonight this is what they will getâ€”to protect our environment and our waterways and to stop gas companies rigging the system, bypassing environment laws and thinking they can have whatever they want. Under these new laws, that will no longer be allowed.

            I'm pleased that at least we can now be honestâ€”because there you have it. That contribution by the Greens' environment spokesperson actually laid out clearly exactly what has been going on here. It was a contribution given with a high degree of certainty which, to my mind, didn't exist until very recently. It sounds to me, as described by Senator Hanson-Young, that this has been in the making for quite some time. I commend the Greens for being the green tail that wags the Labor dogâ€”againâ€”and for being able to achieve these outcomes which, frankly, I feel are going to have a disastrous impact on the Australian economy and the cost of living. For all the things that have been said, this is not going to end well for Australians.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the last answer that was given to me by the minister, it was put to me that a range of entities, individuals and organisations were consultedâ€”no names. I'd appreciated it if there were names provided. I'd also be interested to know whether a regulatory impact statement was undertaken by the government in preparing these last-minute amendments. I'd also be interested to know exactly when these amendments were finalisedâ€”the date and time they were finalisedâ€”because, as I've already put on the record number of times in this debate, we received these amendments at 5.52, with the supplementary explanatory memorandum.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are big changes afoot. They're going to have a significant impact. I think we're going to see a huge amount of duplication. These changes, I believe, will just pave another road for green lawfare to occur. That's great news for the environmental defenders office and bad news for gas consumers, bad news for the economy and bad news for the cost of living. But, I tell you what, that is exactly what certain people in this place proudly fight for, and good on them. That is something that they can stand up for. But I just have to reflect, in asking these questions, on the shambolic nature of where we are today. Just a day and a half away from this place rising for the summer break, from people going back to their electorates, we are rushing this legislation through as if it is going to change the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just last Friday, contributions were sought from senators in relation to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill. There was the majority senators report, which of course told us the bill was amazing and needed no change whatsoever and recommended that the Senate pass the bill as drafted. There was the coalition dissenting report. Our position remains the same on this piece of legislation. We still think it's terrible. We still think it's bad. We still think it's unnecessary to go down this path for all of the reasons I've already outlinedâ€”all of the uncertainty it's going to bring about.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can go through the various contributions to the committee inquiry. Lyndon Schneiders is the executive director of the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation. There was a big element of the debate that took place in relation to these bills during the committee process, and that was a fundamental principle that I thought everyoneâ€”or at least non-government senatorsâ€”shared and stuck to. That was the need to deal with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
             EPBC
            </a>
            Act first, to be able to get a framework legislation around national environmental approval laws in place, have the national environmental standards bedded down and have all of the other relevant elements put in place so we knew exactly what the landscape was going to be. That suddenly isn't a problem anymore. I will quote Lyndon Schneiders again, someone I probably won't quote too many times in this place. The executive director of the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We recommend that the NRM (Nature Repair Market) Bill be delayed until Parliament has been presented with key EPBC reforms, including proposed National Environmental Standards for environmental offsets, regional planning, and threatened species protection, to demonstrate that a rigorous and high integrity regulatory system will support the operation of the Nature Repair Market.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those concerns appear to have fallen on deaf ears tonight because we are wading into this area of legislative change, which is going to have significant impactsâ€”and I do dispute what the minister said in the claim that this will have zero impact on the cost of gas because it won't affect existing projects. Sadly, supply is a key element to being able to meet demand and therefore has an impact on gas prices. So I don't buy that, and I think you will rue the day that you made those comments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the concerns around thatâ€”and, in one of the hearings, Senator Hanson-Young herself made those very comments to departmental officials about this bill being in tatters and it being an absolute sham. But suddenly now it's okay to support it because of some amendments that appeared out of nowhere on the day we're debating this legislation. It just smacks of a Labor-Greens stitch-up, something we should have come to expect in this place. It's something that, sadly, is becoming a hallmark of this government in this term of parliament, where it looks like there's a proper fight on and that there's going to be some consistency and integrity shown by political parties, who go into a process saying, 'You know what? These are our red-line issues and we're not going to budge,' until they budge and they get a deal done behind closed doors, where there is no scrutiny and where there is no regulatory assessment of the impact that these new laws and regulations will have.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no modelling done on what cost implications there will be for individuals or entities seeking to commence a new project. We don't know how many organisations will be caught up in this, with projects that are planned. Surely the government, who work with entities out there, have some understanding of exactly what is in the offing. I haven't got an answer to that and I suspect we won't have one because there is no modelling and there is no concern for what this might mean for the economy, for the community and for the cost of living. It is, as I said before, simply about getting a deal done so that they can claim they have a win at the end of the year in order to try and cover over what has been one of the most shambolic fortnights in parliament, where we have seen terrible things happening and the government trying to pretend there are no issues at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            More broadly, against the backdrop of a government that can't get its act together when it comes to environmental policy, we were promised that the national environmental law replacement, the replacement for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
             EPBC Act
            </a>
            , would be in this place before the end of this year. We have a couple of days left, and there is nothingâ€”not a thing to be seen with regard to that promise that was made by the government. And I wonder why. Why have they done the go-slow on that? Again, it points to the need for this government and this minister, Minister Plibersek, to get a win. And today she gets a win and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Greens
            </a>
            get a win. The people of Australia are the ones who are going to pay for the deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, again, I'd love to know exactly who was consulted in the preparation of these additional consequential amendments that we're discussing right now. Was a regulatory impact statement done, and when, precisely, were these amendments finalised with the Greens given, as I said before, they were tabled at 5.52 this evening?

             Senator Duniam asked about particular organisations that have been consulted in relation to, I think, the water reforms. I think the senator would accept that the Nature Repair Market Bill has been the subject of consultation and discussion through the Senate inquiry, and, indeed, he referred to that in his earlier remarks.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I'm advised that the minister has spoken with, amongst others, Santos,

              Beach Energy
             </a>
             , Tamboran, Empire Energy, and Australian Energy Producers about the amendments that are proposed. But I do reiterate my earlier remarks, which are these. The government went to an election indicating our intention to introduce a water trigger that would cover unconventional gas projects. This is not a surprise. It shouldn't be a surprise to the opposition and will not be a surprise to industry either. In relation to regulatory impact statement requirements, the government has met its
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS" rel="nofollow">
              RIS

             requirements. A RIS was undertaken on the nature repair market, and the Samuel review into the

               <p>
                Minister, we know that an exposure draft hadn't been released for this bill. You mentioned that it was no surprise that there was a water trigger coming. But surely the detail of these changes, these legislated black-letter law changes to the water trigger, matters. It matters how the legislation is written. So, my question to you is: when were relevant stakeholders advised that this bill would be debated this week? Were stakeholders consulted prior to the guillotine motion being passed by the government? And when did stakeholdersâ€”you named Tamboran and Empire, amongst othersâ€”see the black-letter legislation that we're now looking at?

                  Minister, you said in some of your previous remarks that you had taken a water trigger to the election. I'm just interested, in terms of timing, as to why the government hasn't brought that in the past 18 months, given that there are the numbers in the Senate to pass that swiftly. And now we've got this attached to an unrelated bill in these circumstances where I don't think we have adequate time to scrutinise the nature repair market.

                   Senator, you'll know, because we've talked about it at estimates and in other forums, that the government is seeking to progress an ambitious reform agenda around environment protection generally, of which nature repair one part. The amendment to create a water trigger that would cover all forms of unconventional gas is another. Further, there are the broader reforms around the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
                    EPBC
                   </a>
                   Act that arose in part from the consideration of these questions undertaken by Professor Samuel under the previous government. This is a big legislative agenda. We have sought to progress it in the most efficient way possible. We know it requires consultation and discussion. We find ourselves in a position this week to progress two important parts of the government's agendaâ€”the first being the establishment of the arrangements for the nature repair market and the second to put in place a water trigger. I think that you would support the latter. I'm uncertain about your views about the nature repair market as described in our legislation. But we look for opportunities to work with people within the parliament to progress our agenda and it's on that basis we are bringing forward the legislation this evening.

                    I assume we're still waiting for the previous answers. Thank you for that, Minister. It's disappointing that with a government that promises things like a water trigger and has a Senate urging it to get on with that and do it we have to wait 18 months and that it's been bundled into the NRM and pushed through like this when you could have brought it forward at any time. It took a crossbench deal to get you to come good on an environment election commitment, but we see the government very keen to put other election commitments through. Minister, my question is: will the government commit to no reduction in funding for nature and invasive species management after the market is created? The market cannot be a substitute for investment in public good.

                    <p>
                     Senator Pocock, I think you are asking whether the nature repair market and the arrangements that we are putting in place to allow the private sector to make investments in nature repair are the full extent of the government's plans in relation to protecting our environment, and the answer, of course, is no. We understand that there is an enormous amount of work to do in relation to restoring and protecting our environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Part of this arises from a very extended period of neglect. The government previously led by Mr Morrison and, before him, Mr Turnbull and, before him, Mr Abbott got report after reportâ€”including the
                     <i>
                      State
                     </i>
                     <i>
                      of the
                     </i>
                     <i>
                      e
                     </i>
                     <i>
                      nvironment report
                     </i>
                     and the review of the Water for the Environment Special Accountâ€”that showed them that nature was in serious strife, in serious trouble, and that the measures that they were supposed to be pursuing to protect assets like the Murray-Darling Basin were not on track. Instead of acting on those reports and on that information that was provided to them, they hid them. They got an independent review from Professor Samuel that showed that the environment laws were broken and they did nothing serious about that independent review to fix those laws. They refused to act on climate change, a question that we have addressed in other debates. They announced 22 different energy policies and didn't land any of them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So we understand that there is a lot of work to do. Establishing a framework where we can harness private sector investment to support the repair of our natural assets is one part of that, but so is government funding for nature repair and so are better laws to protect our environment when we are contemplating development and so are arrangements to create additional protected areas so that there are parts of the terrestrial environment and the marine environment that are actually protected and the animals and plants that live in them are looked after. All of these things form part of a comprehensive package to tackle issues around the environment. This is not the beginning and the end of the things that our government considers important.

                      I understand your points about the previous government. I've got two questions. Given we're 18 months in, firstly, Iâ€™m interested in which of Graeme Samuel's recommendations the Albanese government have implemented. And, secondly, one of the things that kept coming up in the consultation I did on the nature repair market was that everyone said that there will need to be government investment to get this started. If you look at the carbon market, the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERF" rel="nofollow">
                       ERF
                      </a>
                      â€”a couple of billion dollars or $1.5 billion put into kickstarting that and actually getting a pipeline of projects. Every stakeholder seemed to say: 'Yes, it could potentially work. There are some integrity issues with the Clean Energy Regulator administering something like biodiversity,' which is not exactly fungible and a lot more complex than carbon. My question is how much money is the Albanese government committing to creating that demand and creating a pipeline of projects?

                       I am able to come back to you now, Senator Pocock, in relation to the approach taken to both administrative review and merits review. The bill does define administrative decisions of the Clean Energy Regulator that can be reviewed, and they include refusal to register a project or refusal to issue a biodiversity certificate. Merits review of the decision can be initiated by a person aggrieved by the decision of the regulator, and this includes the person who made the application for the decision, and a decision of a delegate of the regulator would generally be reviewed internally before it can proceed by application to the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
                        Administrative Appeals Tribunal

                       .

                      <p>
                       As you probably know, our government has initiated reforms to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the new model will apply to the nature repair market through relevant legislative amendments. The minister's decisions to make, vary or revoke a method or biodiversity assessment instrument or the advice of the independent advisory committee are not subject to merits review as they are not administrative decisions. The methods and biodiversity instrument are legislative instruments and subject to normal parliamentary process, including disallowance and sunsetting. Methods and biodiversity assessment instruments will be developed in consultation with stakeholders and must be reviewed by the independent advisory committee.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The committee's advice is not subject to merits review. However, the process for creating the advice involves a rigorous statutory process with many integrity elements, including public consultation. The final advice will be published along with submissions to public consultation and a statement of reasons by the minister, and this provides transparency about the advice and how elements such as the biodiversity integrity standards have been applied.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In addition, the independent statutory reviews of the bill conducted every five years will include a review of the operation of the committee and the kinds of advice provided to the committee. Decisions made under the bill may also be reviewed under relevant judicial review legislation in relation to errors of law.

                       For most matters that are the subject of merits or judicial review, the bill allows people directly affected by a decision to ask for a review or appeal the decision, and examples of people who can request a review would include a person who has been refused the issuance of a certificate and a person directly affected by the approval of a project being registered, such as a neighbour. However, the bill does not provide for open standing for such appeals, nor for injunctions to enforce compliance by proponents and others. We have not included this, because open-standing provisions could present a number of risks, including a disincentive for participation in what is a voluntary market, the potential for provisions to be used by one proponent against another with whom they are in competition and undermining the Clean Energy Regulator's approach of bringing a noncompliant proponent back into compliance.

I want to understand whether or not Minister Farrell has told our international partners, like Japan and Korea, that the government is now actively targeting promising new gas suppliers in the Beetaloo with their water trigger. Or has Assistant Minister Ayres, who parades himself as a champion of the manufacturing industry, told Australian manufacturers that their gas supply may now be at risk because of yet another secret deal done with the Greens political party, who just want to shut down their gas?

The sheet has a list of unconventional gas production definitions, which are markedly similar to the definitions introduced by the Greens in their proposed water trigger. Minister, in the amendment on sheet SF110, is it possible to vary the definition of 'unconventional gas' under section 528(d), which states 'any other sources prescribed by the regulations'?

                         , I'm advised that that is a regulation-making power, and it is there to allow the act to keep up with technology. But I think you will also see that the same part of the bill sets out the three primary areas where we are aware that there is a disparity between the way different forms of unconventional gas are treated under the current arrangements.

                          With the catch-all of 'any other sources prescribed by the regulations', would it be possible for the regulations under this act to be varied to include gas from the seabed, much like in the definition that the Greens political party put forward in their own Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Expanding the Water Trigger) Bill 2023 [No. 2]? I want to clarify that this bill would not currently require but does enable regulations which would capture all offshore gas extraction, should the definition of 'unconventional' be changed. I want to understand: is the Minister for the Environment and Water the determining minister for these regulations? Does consultation with any other ministers or state jurisdictions have to occur prior to this change?

                          110 includes references to projects covered by the amendment 'when considered with other developments, whether past, present or reasonably foreseeable developments'. Minister, what is considered 'other developments' in this context? Will it include pipelines, transport infrastructure or storage facilities? I want to understand what consultation has occurred with regard to the wideranging scope of this caveat. Given that these amendments were only circulated at 6 pm this evening, I would imagine that saying 'we will be introducing a water trigger' is a very broad topic.

Without these upgrades and an urgent increase in gas supply, households and businesses may face blackouts and energy shortages this summer. Does the amendment to the

                             and Biodiversity Conservation Act as part of this billâ€”news to us until an hour ago. What that means is the Greens, with Teal Senator Pocock's support, are being allowed to put a bill of their own making onto the end of the government's bill and then vote it all throughâ€”a bill we can't read, can't amend and can't debate.

                             There's a longstanding convention in the Senate that we do one bill at a time and amend only the bill at hand, a rule the government are happy to ignore when they get desperate enough numbers to do a deal with the Greens and Teals. This isn't parliamentary process; it is undemocratic dictatorship. What a joke, and the people will be paying for it. When we call the Greens watermelonsâ€”green on the outside and red on the insideâ€”this is why.

                             I've spoken on several occasions recently on how this Labor government is best friends with the world's predatory parasitic billionaires. This bill is a perfect example of that. Like the failed national electricity market, which is really a racket, this bill allows large corporations to greenwash their businesses. To explain, greenwashing allows a businessâ€”most likely a foreign multinational companyâ€”to make a claim such as being 'net zero friendly'. That's simply not true. They're deceiving investors and customers in the process. They get to net zero by purchasing green certificates or carbon dioxide credits to balance out the environmental costs supposedly incurred in their business operation. A European Union report found that 95 per cent of carbon dioxide credits came from projects that did not make a difference to the environment, and Europol just a few years ago said 95 per cent are crooked. In other words, it's all a con.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The mining industry have come out in favour of offsets, which they call 'avoided-loss offsets'. These offsets occur after purchasing and improving an area of land with the same habitat as that which is destroyed or damaged in the development. This may appear to be mining-friendly, yet it's really more expense and more green tape that would best be handled through the existing system of remediationâ€”put it back the way you found it, or better, which is what is happening. Indeed, one could be concerned that these avoided loss offsets are an alternative to remediation. I certainly hope not.

                             The bill helps wind turbines with the horrible problem of clubbing koalas on the koalas' propertyâ€”clubbing them to death! They could literally club 10 koalas to death and then buy a national biodiversity certificate for 10 new koalas bred somewhere else. As we speak, the Australian Carbon Credit Unit's review is underway. The review is looking at a thousand carbon dioxide credit generating projects to see if they were fair dinkum and have been kept up. The lessons from that review were going to be added to this bill to ensure the national biodiversity certificate system was legitimate. Bringing forward this bill actually ruins that process.

                             opposes greenwashing, although, in most cases, we would suggest that the better option would be for our mining and manufacturing industries to first use environmentally friendly techniques, as they usually do. Then, having done that, be proud of their role in developing the economy, providing jobs and supplying materials that people need for a life of abundance. Perhaps that's just we conservatives taking care of the natural environment and taking care of people. Some submissions to the Senate inquiry called on the government to purchase the certificates themselves to provide certainty that, should a project be completed, there would be someone to buy the resulting certificate. Minister Plibersek has ruled this outâ€”the only decision in this whole process One Nation can support.

It will never stop. I would think that the federal government would be better off spending money on tax cuts for working Australians and paying off our debt so that interest rates come down, but that's just conservative values againâ€”human values; real environmental values.

                             '. Wall Street provides a means for financing businesses to expand productive capacity. This bill provides a means to restrict productive capacity through taking productive farmland and returning it to Gaia. I don't see the comparison with a genuine financial product, unless the minister was making a comparison to

                             . That would be accurate in that case. The product itself, biodiversity credits, is subjective and, over time, will require more and more personnel to conduct compliance on an ever-increasing number of projects, just like the

                             Many submissions opposed the use of these certificates for environmental offsets, including the Greens', and I note their amendments remove the offsets for the purpose of these certificates. This would seem a significant conflict between the minister's intent and the Greens' intent. What a mess! The Nature Repair Market Bill 2023 is a solution to a problem that has not yet been defined and does not meet real needs, just like the failed National Electricity Market.

This is something that Senator Thorpe has correctly pointed out in the second reading amendment, which I will support. How do you pass a bill like this ahead of the implementation of the Samuels review? How do we know which projects should be supported and which are not needed, or, worse, which projects are a load of bollocks, like the stuff that comes out of the south end of a northbound bull, as most climate projects areâ€”climate fraud?

                             In relation to ensuring integrity around the use of offsets, the Australian government is working to introduce a new national environmental standard for actions and restoration contributions. This new standard is expected to include a requirement that offsets must deliver net gain for impacted protected matters and that biodiversity projects certified under the Nature Repair Market Bill will only be able to be used as offsets if they meet the new standard. What new standard? Oh, wait, you haven't written it yet! Great. Minister Plibersek is trying to pass a bill that implements a standard that hasn't been written yet. Can someone please give the government's legislation chocolate wheel back to rotary and we'll go back to doing things properlyâ€”you know, in the correct order.

                             . That sounds good. This is the government's overarching environmental blueprint. I notice that, on page 32, this plan includes a provision that traditional owners will have more control over Commonwealth national parks. More control! Australians who are used to bushwalking, camping and generally enjoying the beautiful national parks Australia offers are flat out of luck under this Labor government. 'No nature for you. Get back to your 15-minute cities.' That's exactly what the United Nations sustainable development goals doâ€”they reduce everyday Australians to the status of serfs, imprisoned in their 15-minute cities, locked in a digital identity prison, owning nothing and eating bugs instead of real food. I first said that in the Senate in 2016, and the sniggers were obvious. Well, nobody's sniggering now. Now you're all trying to justify the abomination your globalist masters are working to impose.

Over and over again. They are worried about the quality of the water in their communities. They're worried about the impact that fracking is going to have on groundwater in their local area. They are worried that gas companies are allowed to just start fracking without any national environmental approval. It's 2023, people. We're in a climate crisis, and all we get right now is gas companies thinking they can call the shots. Well, no more. No more. Under these amendments, gas corporations are going to be held to account. There are going to be no more loopholes. Santos, I'm sure, are not happy, and I'm sure Tamboran are not happy. But, of course, over and over and over again, we see members of the National and Liberal parties come in here to do the bidding of the big gas cartel. They know who their mouthpieces are in this place, and it's this lot over there.

Let's burn it, let's dig it up, let's knock it down, let's bulldoze it.' It doesn't really matter what wildlife is left over, it doesn't matter what the condition of the habitat is, and the state of our climate doesn't matter to them; they're a bunch of shills for the gas industry and fossil fuel companies. They can't stand environmental protection in any form. They want to be able to log, dig and burn wherever they can, and it's a time we put a stop to it. That is why the Greens are standing here todayâ€”to amend this bill to put some standard of environmental protection in our law to make gas companies have to explain themselves to their local communities, to the landholders, to the farmers and to the traditional owners in areas like the Beetaloo.

                               asked me a range of questions, and I have assembled some of the information she seeks. She asked whether the minister for the environment would be the determining minister for the regulations. The answer to that question is yes, noting that these regulations must be within the scope of the regulatory power that's provided in the act and that these regulations will be disallowable.

                               Senator McDonald asked about the capacity for the seabed to be brought within the scope of offshore activity, to be brought within the scope of the water trigger. I am advised that, because the trigger is defined in relation to unconventional gas, that is not likely, as the gas which is presently extracted offshore is conventional. However, should a minister seek to do so, as with the other regulatory arrangements, any such regulation would be disallowable, and the Senate would have an opportunity to consider those matters at that time.

                               Senator McDonald asked about the provisions which provide for the interaction with other developments. I am advised that this language mirrors the existing language in the bill as it relates to coal seam gas.

                               Finally, we understand the significance of regulatory certainty on the resource sector and we understand the significance of securing sufficient gas supply to meet our domestic requirements. The truth is that those on the other side of the chamber were warned on at least a dozen occasions when they were in government that Australia was hurtling towards a gas supply problem in the domestic east coast gas market, and their response was 22 failed energy policies that left Australian households and businesses overexposed and underprepared for a global energy crisis. We have taken a very different approach. We have reformed the ADGSM to carefully balance domestic energy needs with Australia's responsibility to meet international contractual obligationsâ€”and this is certainty; this is clarity. We've legislated a credible emissions reduction policy, through the strengthened safeguard mechanism, providing the certainty that business has been crying out for on climate policy. And the government's gas code of conduct is working to shield east coast gas consumers from volatile international gas prices and to reduce the risk of supply shortfalls forecast by the

                               I will leave it there, noting that others wish to make a contribution in the remaining time. The government understands the significance of this industry. We are taking the steps necessary to provide regulatory certainty, and that's important for business and for the community.

                                       So can the Commonwealth government, under the new environmental laws, use money that is paid into the fund by proponents to then buy certificates? If so, that's clearly an offset, with the government as the middle person.

                                           Two words from Senator Hanson-Young ring in my ears: 'no more'. There'll be no more new gas to bring down prices, no more support for households struggling with the cost of living, no more jobs for people in the regional communities where many of these projects exist. Certainly, there'll be no more answers to the questions that have been asked. That's not because the minister can't answer them or doesn't want to. There are no answers to these questions. Senator

Consultation? Regulatory impact statement? Any impact on the cost of living? No answer, no answer, no answer. This is what happens when, behind closed doors, under the cover of darkness, in smoke-filled roomsâ€”whatever analogy you want to come up withâ€”you find Labor and the Greens doing dodgy deals. Their smiles get bigger the worse this is for Australian households and the economy. Senator McKim's smile couldn't be bigger.

They are as happy as they can be because they got their deal. It is a bad day for Australians. But this is what we have come to expect in this brave new world of Labor-Green governmentâ€”
