       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This reform has been a long time coming.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreement to introduce an R 18+ category has been reached after 10 years of negotiations with the

        Over these ten years the Australian computer game industry has grown – along with the number of Australian computer gamers.

       <p class="italic">
        Research conducted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_University" rel="nofollow">
         Bond University
        </a>
        suggests that nine in every ten Australian homes now has a device for playing computer games.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The average age of Australian computer gamers is 32 – with women making up 47 per cent of computer game players.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian gaming industry is forecast to grow at a rate of about ten per cent a year – with forecasts predicting it will reach $2.5 billion annually by 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A lot of Australians are passionate about this reform.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When the Attorney-General’s Department released a discussion paper on the introduction of an R 18+ classification category for computer games in 2009 they received 58,437 submissions in response.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        98 per cent of these supported the introduction of an R 18+ category.

        and Minister for Justice - Minister O’Connor – pursued this issue throughout his time in the portfolio.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Last year he led the discussion of this issue with State and Territory Attorneys General at the Standing Council on Law and Justice. At their July meeting the Ministers decided to support this reform.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill will implement the Commonwealth’s obligations as part of this agreement – and State and Territory jurisdictions will follow with their own legislation later this year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is anticipated that the Act provided for in this Bill will come into effect on the first of January next year.
