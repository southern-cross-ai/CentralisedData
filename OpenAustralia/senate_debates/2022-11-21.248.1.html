         I would like to provide some advice to the chamber just so that they are aware. Tonight is the first Monday under the new routine of business, where there will be no divisions from 6.30 until adjournment. I want to take this opportunity to remind senators that in lieu of calling a division they are able to record their voting position in
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         by way of a request to the chair. This approach would facilitate the smooth running of the chamber during this time and ensure that we are able to continue consideration of the legislative program as well.

          The debate was interrupted because we ran out of time, so I'd like to continue with some questions to the minister with regard to this bill. The last question I asked the minister was: what benefits are given to which people with regard to being able to pay cash? The minister responded by saying that Aboriginals in certain remote areas could actually pay cash. Then I asked: what about white Australians? The minister's response to me was that I'd gone on my racist rant again. What I'd like to ask the minister, if it is racism, is to please tell me: how do you define every other Australian who is not Aboriginal? Don't you believe that your policy in this bill, which clearly defines that Aboriginal people can pay by cash in remote areas where other Australians can't, is racist when it's clearly based on race and not on an individual needs basis? So who is the racist here, Minister? Please answer my question.

           That's not what I actually said, Senator Hanson. But what we've said is that it is feasible that some people will still be able to pay cash in certain circumstances. That would obviously be determined through the department. I gave some examples of what that would be, whether it be in a remote Indigenous community, whether it be in some remote geographic areas or whether it be someone who's a domestic violence victim. Those are some examples that I gave. Obviously, how that would be determined would go through a departmental process.

            In the bill you define people of Aboriginality, Aboriginals who can actually access these childcare services. I know the definition of an Aboriginal came up earlier, which is self-determination accepted by the elders, or the fact that you were born Aboriginal. Are you happy with these definitions?

             I've already provided an answer to this question, Senator Hanson. The definition of an eligible Aboriginal and

              I have grave concerns about this because, if you look at the census of people claiming Aboriginality, that they are Aboriginals, in the last census it was around about 850,000 people. In the one prior to that it was about 670,000 people. There has been an increase over five years of 23 per cent to 24 per cent of people claiming to be of Aboriginal decent, whereas the rest of the population increased by eight per cent, and that included migrants into the country. Could it be possible that a lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon claiming to be Aboriginals when they are not and claiming benefits from the taxpayer that they are clearly not entitled to? Your silence shows me you can't even answer that question because you don't know how to answer it.

                 If we have a discrepancy in this nation and a division because people are coming from other countries, islanders who are claiming Aboriginality and claiming benefits in this nation purely because of the fact that they can under this definition that we have—what defines an Aboriginal is self-identification—do you believe that the definition is good enough for them to get taxpayer funded services that the hardworking people of Australia have to pay for?

                    The question is that the question be put. Senator Hanson, I will draw your attention to the question before the chair. Senator Faruqi has moved that the question be put. Those of that opinion say 'aye'. Those against say 'no'. I think the ayes have it.

                    <p>
                     I want to defer the vote till tomorrow. What Senator Faruqi has said can't be put to the chamber for a vote, because there's no voting.

                     The TEMPORARY CHAIR: There is voting on the voices, but, because you've asked for a division, I can't put the question. Senator Faruqi?

                      , I'm just wondering, based on what the minister said earlier, whether we can still record our voting positions without having a division tonight.

                      The TEMPORARY CHAIR: Well, you did put the question that the motion be put, Senator Faruqi. That was carried on the voices, but I cannot implement that because it needs a vote in the chamber. I'm advised by the clerks that we have to report progress.
