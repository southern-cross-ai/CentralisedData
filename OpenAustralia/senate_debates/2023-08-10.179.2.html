        I think the contributions made here today highlight some of the amazing work that we as senators are able to do. They also demonstrates how we can work together around this chamber in a very sensitive and caring manner, so congratulations for those contributions. I would like to talk about the highlights for me this week. There has been a buzz around the parliament—that is, how well the Matildas have done, the excitement and the way not only we in this building but the Australian people also have gotten behind the Matildas.
       </p>
       <p>
        In talking about what's really been happening in the parliament over the last two weeks, I think it is important we talk about the achievements of the Albanese Labor government. We have seen the introduction of the cheaper childcare benefits, which have now taken effect. We have lowered the price of medicines. We had a debacle here in relation to the 60-day scripts that were going to benefit six million Australians with cheaper medicines. I've spoken about this not only in this place but also to the minister. In my home state, it is part of my responsibility to make sure that in small rural areas the pharmacists become the benefactors of the money that the government is going to save by now having 60-day dispensing available, bearing in mind that the doctors have their right to continue to give 30-day scripts. We have to trust our doctors; they are supportive. All the consumer groups are very supportive and that will make a difference in helping to address the economic crisis that we are in and with the cost of living that is impacting on Australians at this point in time.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also rolling out, in conjunction with states and territories, energy bill relief. I'm delighted to speak again about the fact that the first of four Medicare urgent care clinics have opened in my home city of Launceston. That's going really well. For local people, the benefit is that they will only need their Medicare card to be able to get the urgent care they need, which will take pressure off the staff at our local Launceston General Hospitals, which, I think, is important.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also speak about my concern for those in this place, who I know—a lot of them—in their heart of hearts want to see real improvement for the lives of our fellow
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        people but they are bound by their party, most of them, particularly those in the shadow cabinet and shadow portfolios. Unfortunately, they have to tread the path of their leader, Mr Peter Dutton. I think it's really sad that in 2008, when there was the historic apology given in this parliament, the now leader of the Liberals walked out of the House of Representatives. It seems to me that he hasn't moved forward. After hearing the heartfelt contributions on the motion about the great work of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, they don't have that same passion to improve the lives of our fellow Australians by making sure that we provide the opportunity to hear directly from the First Nations people so we have better health outcomes, so we extend the life expectancy of First Nations people, so they can enjoy the real economic benefits so they can see their future, and to have that recognition because they know better. They absolutely know better than we do.

        was when we had an inquiry into petrol sniffing. I was just amazed, absolutely amazed with what was happening.
