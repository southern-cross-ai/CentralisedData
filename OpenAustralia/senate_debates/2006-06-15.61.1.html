        My question is to Senator Kemp, the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Can the minister confirm that the Howard government is intending to slash funding to child-care service providers in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        who offer support to families and children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds? Is the senator aware that one such centre, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hawthorn" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Hawthorn
        </a>
        , may have its budget slashed from $340,000 to $190,000 a year, which is a massive 30 per cent reduction in available salaries for child-care workers? Why is the Howard government being so callous towards migrant families, or is this just another example of the Howard government making it even harder for time-pressed Australian families to access child care?

         What an astonishing question! The Howard government have more than doubled places for child care since we came to government. I am absolutely astonished that you would believe that there is a policy to deny Australian families child care when there is a fundamental policy to provide additional services for child care for Australian families. Indeed, the child-care announcements in the last budget were widely welcomed.
        </p>
        <p>
         You raise a specific issue. I have looked very carefully at the extensive brief I have received from Mr Brough in relation to child care. Given the time available, I have not been able to detect a brief on the specific matters that you have raised. But because I am a helpful senator and because I like to make sure that the Senate is well informed, I will make inquiries of the minister to see whether he is able to provide any additional information on the matters you have raised. If he is, I will get back to you as promptly as possible.

           , I ask a supplementary question. The senator should know that 2,200 people have signed a petition against this cut, so I am surprised that the minister is not aware of it. Considering that the centre in question recruits, trains and supports 120 child-care workers, the government should guarantee that there will be no capacity loss in this sector. How are parents from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds expected to find the time to work, learn English or seek employment when they are unable to access suitable child care? Does this once again show that under the Howard government there is no real choice in child care?

              You would have noticed that if there is one very high priority in this government it is to improve the services for child care and to improve access. Senator, I am astonished, given your own party’s policy and given your own party’s atrocious failure in this area of child care, that that has not filtered through to you. I am a helpful senator. I am one who will always seek to inform those on the other side who are not prepared to do the work, do their own research and get their own information.
