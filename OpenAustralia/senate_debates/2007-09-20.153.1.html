        My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to the release of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Body_Count" rel="nofollow">
         Iraq Body Count
        </a>
        ’s assessment that over 79,000 civilian deaths have occurred since 2003. I also refer the minister to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        assessments that over two million Iraqis have fled their country and that over one million Iraqis have been internally displaced. Does the minister agree that Iraq is a human and security catastrophe? What humanitarian assistance is the government providing to relieve the suffering in the refugee camps that now exist in Jordan and Syria and the displaced persons camps that are increasing in size within Iraq?

         I thank Senator Kirk for her important question. There is no doubt that any civilian death is one too many. We all agree with that. There are no authoritative estimates of the total number of Iraqi civilian casualties, due in part, of course, to the complex nature of the violence in Iraq. Estimates of civilian casualties and the methodology behind them vary very widely. For example,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         website
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Body_Count" rel="nofollow">
          Iraq Body Count
         </a>
         estimates that, as at 6 September, between 71,302 and 77,852 civilians have been killed since March 2003. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         Assistance Mission for Iraq estimates that some 34,452 were killed in 2006. I repeat that any civilian death is certainly one too many. The multinational force, in cooperation with the Iraqi security forces, has strenuously sought to avoid civilian casualties, in accordance with international humanitarian law. In stark contrast, terrorists and insurgents have set out to kill and maim civilians and those in the Iraqi security forces. The multinational force in Iraq will continue to work with Iraqi security forces to prevent such attacks and apprehend their perpetrators.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Kirk has also asked what we are doing to assist Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons. We are very concerned about the humanitarian situation facing many of the Iraqis—over two million residing in neighbouring countries, my briefing note says, and over two million internally displaced. Many of these were displaced under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" rel="nofollow">
          Saddam Hussein
         </a>
         regime due to war, human rights abuses and the deliberate expulsion of citizens from their homes. Australia has provided over $75 million in humanitarian assistance, including for Iraqi refuges and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDP" rel="nofollow">
          IDP
         </a>
         s, since 2003. On 14 February 2007, Mr Downer announced $6 million to assist Iraqi refugees, $3 million to the United Nations
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCR" rel="nofollow">
          HCR
         </a>
         and $3 million to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOM" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian delegation was represented at the Australian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
          UNHCR
         </a>
         conference on Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons and was led by the ambassador and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Representative" rel="nofollow">
          Permanent Representative
         </a>
         to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_in_Geneva" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations in Geneva
         </a>
         . It included officials from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and AusAID, so the personnel making up the representation were very well placed to have Australia’s input and to record Australia’s concern about this most important matter.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that Christian families are being persecuted and brutalised on a daily basis by all factions, oil production has been slashed, Iran has been emboldened and international terrorism has been made worse, can the minister indicate whether she thinks the Australian government’s assistance is having any impact at all?

          <p>
           Absolutely. We have often spoken in this chamber about the importance and relevance of the Australian troop commitments. Australia, as I said last week in answer to a question, is committed to staying in Iraq until the Iraqi security forces no longer require our support. The government decided in August to extend our troop commitments until 30 June 2008. It is important that we stay and that we get the job done. Our coalition partners have expressed their strong appreciation for Australia’s very valuable contribution. The ongoing presence of Australia and other members of the coalition in Iraq is at the request of the government in Iraq and we certainly do not intend to leave until that particular job is done.
