         I thank Senator Polley for her very good question and her ongoing interest in the world-class science research that Australia conducts under this government. Last Friday I joined the Prime Minister, the

          Chief Scientist
         </a>
         and Minister Emerson at the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, where we launched the government's strategic research priorities. These strategic research priorities took the place of the national research priorities. This change was foreshadowed in the Australian government's National Research Investment Plan released in November 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are 15 priorities and they are designed to drive Australia's research investment. The priorities align with the societal changes covering issues of immediate and critical importance to Australia. These challenges addressed the priorities of living in a changed environment, promoting population health and wellbeing, managing food and water assets, securing Australia's place in a changing world and, most importantly, lifting productivity and economic growth.

         chief executive, Belinda Robertson, welcomed these priorities. She said: 'The priorities provide a focus to support prudent research investment decision making and will help to ensure that the return to the nation on this investment is maximised.' These priorities—

           I thank Senator Polley for her very insightful supplementary question. Under this government, investment in science, research and innovation has increased by nearly 30 per cent compared with the previous Howard coalition government. In the 2013-14 budget we committed $185 million, over two years, to continue with the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, or NCRIS. NCRIS funds projects in support of important research work that will benefit future generations. We have also committed a further $135 million over the next five years to extend the Future Fellowship Scheme, which will provide for 150 more scholarships. The Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre, based in Hobart, received an extra $25 million over the next five years. We have invested $200 million—

             Yes, well researched, as Senator Abetz said. Our investment in the Hobart based Antarctic CRC will support Tasmanian jobs. The Antarctic sector is very important to the Tasmanian economy and is worth nearly $200 million per year. Around 1,000 people are employed in this sector supporting nearly 100 small and medium enterprises. You may laugh about it, Senator Abetz, but this is very important to the people of Tasmania and it is a good decision for this government to make. Our $100 million investment in the new health and biomedical facility, supporting life-saving research and training for the next generation of healthcare professionals—
