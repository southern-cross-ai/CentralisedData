        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to the questions asked in the other place of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Regional Development,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">

         I thank the senator for the question. Obviously I have been here, so I haven't listened to every word that has been uttered in the other place. With all due respect to my senatorial colleague, I am not necessarily going to take as read her assertion about what has been said. But I will make the point that the opposition, in their attack on this, are seeking that this government uphold a standard that they never did. You never did it in government and never in opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality is that we have strengthened the ministerial code of conduct so that ministers are not able to hold shares or blind trusts. If you had this standard in government, would you like to know who would be in breach? The Leader of the Opposition would be in breach, the Leader of the National Party would be in breach, the Shadow Treasurer would be in breach and the Manager of Opposition Business would be in breach.

I am sure the Prime Minister has answered whatever questions the Leader of the Opposition or his tactics team have put to the Prime Minister. We have made clear that the ministerial code doesn't require—

                      has spoken generically about the ministerial code—has made a number of other assertions irrelevant to the question but has spoken about the code. It was a direct question about whether a minister has breached the code. If the Leader of the Government in the Senate indicates that she is not aware of the precise details, in the 13 seconds remaining, she should take the question on notice so she can provide a direct answer to the direct question.

I note the comments you made in relation to her most recent statement. I don't believe that is a point of order, but it is up to Senator Wong whether she takes it on a notice or not. Minister.
