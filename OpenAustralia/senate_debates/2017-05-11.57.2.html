        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cormann. Last night
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bolt" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Bolt
        </a>
        asked the minister six times what peak gross debt is projected to be under the federal government, and six times the minister refused to answer. I ask the minister: what nominal figure is gross debt projected to reach in 2027-28?

         I am really pleased that Senator Ketter watches my interviews with Mr Bolt. I think we all know that Mr Bolt does what Senator Ketter does—that is, ask me a question where he already knows the answer. Senator Ketter knows very well that in Budget Paper No. 1, at page 7-8, all those numbers are spelled out. He also would be aware that at the back of the budget papers, in tables 11-14 and 11-15, it is all spelled out—

          They are getting themselves very excited! The very important point that I made in the interview yesterday is that the number that Senator Katter knows very well is much lower than it would have been if Labor had stayed in government. The projection is there for all to see—that, at the end of the forward estimates, gross debt is projected to be $606 billion—

              publishes an issuance strategy for the budget year only, and that any projections beyond the budget year are based on a set of technical assumptions and will vary with changes in these assumptions and budget estimates and projections. So, based on these technical assumptions—and this is published in the budget papers, at page 7-8 of Budget Paper No. 1—by the end of the forward estimates period, gross debt is expected to reach $606 billion.

                I thank the minister for that answer. Yesterday and today, when asked, Treasurer Morrison could not identify what figure gross debt is projected to reach. Does the Treasurer not know? Or was he, like Minister Cormann, just too ashamed to admit that gross debt is projected to reach $725 billion under the Turnbull government?

                 The point I would make again is that there are very many serious conversations that we need to have in Australia about our future economic and fiscal challenges and opportunities. There are serious conversations to be had on how we can ensure that people across Australia and families across Australia can have the best possible opportunities to get ahead. And all we are getting from the Labor Party is juvenile student politicking.

                 I actually answered the question. This is the game the Labor Party are playing: they are asking me a question where I know the answer, they know I know the answer, they know the answer; everybody knows—

                   On relevance: the question went to the issue of the shame that the Treasurer has in not being able to actually state that the projected debt is going to be $725 billion under the Turnbull government. That was the question; Senator Cormann has not gone near it.

                     . What I was about to say is that the Turnbull government is proud—proud—of the fact that we have been able to reduce expenditure to the tune of $250 billion over the current and medium term. That is $250 billion that Labor would have had to borrow that we do not have to borrow, that will ensure that debt is lower than it would have been under Labor, which will help us to pay off debt once we are back in surplus—

                       Given that growth debt is projected to reach $725 billion, isn't former Treasurer Costello correct when he says that, under Prime Minister Turnbull, 'No-one now is talking about paying back debt'?

                        What former Treasurer Peter Costello has also said in the past, what we have said in the past—he is a giant of Australian politics, of course—is that the debt number that is actually the most relevant is government net debt. And government net debt, both in dollar terms and as a share of
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
                         GDP
                        </a>
                        , is projected to peak in 2018-19 at $375.1 billion and at 19.8 per cent, and then it is projected to reduce, reduce, reduce, reduce to the point where, by 2027-28, it is projected to come down to 8½ per cent of the share of GDP—8½ per cent of the share of GDP. The Labor Party are playing politics, but they cannot go past the fact that, if Labor were still in government, on the policy settings that they left behind after the most shameful period in government in the history of the Commonwealth, debt would be much worse today than what it is. We have made significant progress in reducing the level of debt, compared to what it would have been under Labor.

                          I thank Senator Duniam for his question and interest in these matters. This budget gives certainty to all people in Australia living with a disability, to their families and to their carers that their needs will be met as the

                          moves towards full scheme in 2020. The budget provides $33 million over three years for a local care workforce package to help disability providers deliver the work that is needed to meet demand from people entering the NDIS, as well as older Australians requiring aged-care services. A new independent national body, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, will be established to oversee NDIS service standards and enforce participants' rights, at a cost of $209 million over four years.

                          Significant reforms to disability employment services will also better connect jobseekers who have a disability with a job that is right for them. Significant reforms include allowing jobseekers to choose and change their

This includes higher levels of funding for placing people with greater barriers to employment in a job or for securing employment in a more challenging labour market.

                                . I think many, many Australians are also aware, as they have been for many, many years, because, despite promises, slogans and bumper stickers, the previous Labor government failed to fully fund the
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                                 NDIS
                                </a>
                                , leaving a substantial annual funding gap of almost $4 billion from 2019-20.

                                The claim that Labor makes that it fully funded it has no credibility when Labor's actual budget papers did not link any savings to the NDIS. That proposition only appeared in a little glossy document in 2013-14. That glossy document spoke about 'other long-term savings' that were not identified in any budget paper. When asked in Senate estimates whether these measures could be listed in detail, Treasury's response was: 'The short answer is no.' And, Mr President, may I say we can always go back to an interview on 2 May 2013 where, when referring to the proposal by Labor to increase the Medicare levy, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, said, 'I'm sure we will get bipartisanship.'
