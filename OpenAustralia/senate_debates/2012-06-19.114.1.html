           During the debate, Minister, concerns were raised, particularly in relation to privacy, by Senator Boyce and me. Is the government assured that the provisions contained in the amendments go fully to addressing privacy concerns that have been raised not just here but as part of the inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. They are of concern and have been of concern throughout this whole process. I really just want to hear, Minister, your assurance that that is the case, particularly in relation to the concerns that were raised in relation to the powers of the Australian

            The e-health record system will have bank-strength security features, including extremely strong encryption and firewalls. These protections are in line with the very high standards required by both the Department of Defence and the Attorney-General's Department. Paper based records, as we know, can be copied, stolen or modified without anyone knowing. With the e-health record system patients will be able to view a log that shows them every occasion on which their record has been accessed or changed and by whom. Consumers will need a secure password to access the system, which they can invent themselves. The password will then be encrypted, as with internet banking. For even more security, when you log on you will have to enter a personal question to confirm your identity. On top of this, the system will automatically log you off if your session is inactive. As for the question about privacy and security, they are fundamental to the effectiveness of an e-health record system. Unlike the former government's proposal, as I recall, this one is personally controlled, and I think that gives enormous power to the health consumer to manage their personally controlled electronic health record—something that will give the community confidence in the system, which I am sure we are all looking for.

             I understand that, under these amendments, the role of the system operator in providing de-identified data for research and public health purposes will be clarified, with the objective that the aggregate data be used to improve understanding of population health issues. Again in relation to privacy, when the system is accessed for the purposes of de-identifying data, will that also be covered by the legislation in terms of logging in and logging off? One accepts the logging-in and logging-off where it is a medical practitioner accessing the information. But, with this broader scope, do those provisions ensure that those privacy concerns are met even where the data is used in that manner?

              The amendments specify that it is a function of the system operator to prepare and disclose de-identified data for research or public health purposes. The amendments also provide that the minister can make rules to specify requirements with which the system operator must comply when preparing and providing de-identified data. The system operator will be authorised to delegate this function to a Public Service employee of the

              of Medicare or any other person with the consent of the minister. Despite any delegation functions, the system operator will ultimately be responsible for this function.

             <p>
              It is intended that the rules will provide detailed requirements regarding the manner in which the system operator de-identifies data and discloses it to requesting parties. For example, it will be critical to set rules in respect of de-identifying the information of small populations to ensure persons are not directly or indirectly identifiable. It is likely that the requirements will draw on existing requirements developed by the

              ethics committee or the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council. The rules may also provide criteria that the system operator must consider in determining whether or not to disclose the requested de-identified data.

                Could I ask you to be a little more specific, Senator, so I know exactly what issue it is I am trying to address. There are general provisions in the legislation around consent, as you understand. I am trying to accurately answer your question, so I would not mind knowing what you are really asking.

                 I do not have it in front of me, but in the Senate committee inquiry there were concerns raised about the consent arrangements. If the officials have other information and want a bit more time to get it, I have some other questions, if that would help, Parliamentary Secretary.

                    The federal government have been building the infrastructure for a national e-health record system that will allow consumers to set their own computer-based electronic health records. The infrastructure has been built and it is going through the final stages of rigorous testing at the moment. This is about developing the foundations of the system carefully and systematically. We are determined to get it right and to ensure that the system is rolled out properly, phased in over time. The minister has always said that that is what the government would do—and, in the debate on the legislation both here and in the other place, many of those opposite endorsed that approach.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We know this is a complex area of reform and that a national e-health record system will continue to build over time as consumers and healthcare providers join the system. We have been working closely with consumers, healthcare providers and others to get that right, and we will continue to do so.

                      I will get you some detail on that. To be frank, we are talking about bringing in a fundamental change to the way we provide health services in this country. We are bringing in a massive reform which will improve the health outcomes of Australian health consumers. I think Australians who are interested in their health will be far more interested in whether or not they get a quality personally controlled electronic health record rather than when there will be a launch.

                       But, Minister, the point is that this was all supposed to be ready, and I will not reiterate what Senator Boyce has said. One assumes that, if you have a system which will be rolled out and start from a particular day that it will start on that day. I appreciate your point about a launch but on 1 July, when people should be able to register for electronic health records, it is not likely to be operational. My question to you then is: when is the electronic records system likely to be operational?
