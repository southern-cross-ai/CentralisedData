        I believe the amendment should be agreed to, so I commend it to the chamber. For the benefit of senators, when the debate was interrupted before question time we were discussing the issue of whether it should be a two-year mandatory data retention period, if it is mandatory at all, or, in conflicting proposals, three months or six months. We had spoken of diminishing returns and the fact that most data is nowhere near two years old in the jurisdictions for which we have information and that we do not have information in Australia; and thus, like so much of the rest of this policy, we are proceeding on the basis of anecdote rather than evidence. I do not propose to repeat myself because we still have a long way to go, so I commend

         amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 7661. I move amendment (7) on sheet 7661:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) Schedule 1, item 1, page 11 (after line 5), after section 187C, insert:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         187CA Information or documents must be kept in Australia
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A service provider must take all reasonable steps to ensure that information or a document that the provider must keep under section 187A is:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) kept in Australia; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) kept by a body incorporated, owned and operated in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for this amendment is widespread industry disquiet that sensitive, personal information will be stored offshore in jurisdictions with more flexible approaches to privacy and security. My party, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats" rel="nofollow">
          Liberal Democrats
         </a>
         , dislikes protectionism of any sort, and it is a sign of how bad this bill is that I have even considered an amendment of this kind. But it probably is in the national interest not to have all our personal data bundled up and stored somewhere else overseas, very likely in China because that is where it is cheaper. It would be a honeypot for not just our own intrusive snoops and bullies but everyone else's as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, I recognise that corporate ownership can be quite complicated and very difficult to ascertain, and companies will often subcontract out. That is why I have included a requirement that the service provider 'take all reasonable steps'. This will go some way towards mitigating some of these issues. For example, it would ensure that, if a service provider's contracted data storage provider were to subcontract to a provider outside of Australia without the service provider's consent or knowledge, the service provider could not be penalised for it.

          I will speak briefly to this because it does traverse an area that we addressed earlier, to a degree. It does require a bit of careful drafting, and I will just also foreshadow that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Greens
          </a>
          have an amendment to similar effect, worded slightly differently from the way that Senator Leyonhjelm has tried to handle it—and it is difficult.
         </p>
         <p>
          We heard, I think, a variety of views on this matter when Senator Xenophon, Senator Leyonhjelm and I convened a forum of interested parties from across the political spectrum and from industry, digital rights organisations and advocates late last year. One of the guests we had was the then iiNet Chief Regulatory Officer Steve Dalby, and he put forward quite forcefully the fact that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP" rel="nofollow">
           ISP
          </a>
          s were trying to find the lowest cost option for storing the required data which, in his words, 'at the moment is in China'.
         </p>
         <p>
          I recognise that not all the costs of the data retention scheme are in storage; in fact, storage gets cheaper by the year. But of course data volume is increasing, and it is a bit difficult to tell whether in the future these things are going to keep pace, because, as fast as technologists work out cleverer ways of storing ever-larger quantities of material in smaller and cheaper spaces, we generate more of the staff. So storage is only part of the cost. I suspect Senator Brandis, if I asked him, could not provide us with a break-up of the roughly $390 million—how much of that estimated cost is storage, how much is retrieval systems, how much of it is compliance administration. I suspect, if those numbers exist, they may well be beyond the reach of the Senate, although I would be delighted to be proven wrong.
         </p>
         <p>
          The point Mr Dalby was making was not so much that iiNet would take up that option of the lowest cost hosting provider but that perhaps others, with fewer resources than an entity the size of iiNet, might have to do just that. We heard estimates from industry earlier this year that, potentially, half of the smaller end of the spectrum of service providers might go to the wall as a result of this. I think it is spectacular reversal of policies of regulation that, just for a change, you have actually been supported by all sides of politics, and the disaggregation of Telstra from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
           NBN
          </a>
          was a part of that—taking the wholesale business out of private hands and bringing that back into public hands, and then letting the private sector let it rip at the retail end. That has actually created what I would argue is a wonderful fragmentation in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSP" rel="nofollow">
           RSP
          </a>
          end of the market, but it is those smaller and newer players that we will potentially put to the wall. They are going to be seeking the lowest costs. They will not have the legal clout and they may not have the technical clout to embed the kind of security provisions that are going to be required. They do not necessarily have high-powered legal counsel and they are not necessarily going to be able to run sophisticated demands of this government to recover their costs. That end of industry, in particular, who already operate on pretty fine margins, are going to be looking to cut costs wherever they can. Some of that obviously is going to be in storage.

          and

           KPMG
          </a>
          not that long ago, and he said that while the cloud was a 'wonderfully efficient thing' and it was where everyone was going, 'I would rather the cloud hovered over Sydney or Melbourne rather than Shanghai or Bangalore, where it was governed by someone else's sovereign legislative system.' He said he would feel much more comfortable with the data governed by Australian law than by law in some other country. He said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          These days every bit of data is sensitive and I know Telstra stores its data in 13 different places
         </p>
         <p>
          That is not necessarily 13 different countries or jurisdictions, but Telstra, as a result of its very long history and the huge variety of services that it offers, hosts material on quite different kinds of platforms and systems, and obviously the cloud, almost by definition, is transnational.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is the speech in which I believe Mr Irvine declared himself a 'cyber nationalist', which is an interesting concept to fold into a medium as borderless as the internet. The reason he put that view is that, although Senator Brandis was at some pains to inform us earlier that Australian material hosted in other countries is still obliged to treated under Australian privacy law, it is difficult in advance to establish whether the protection from data breaches is as robust as we would find here in Australia, and is it is going to be easier to establish, I would argue, that the protections are up to scratch? This is people's personal private material. It is not the personal private material of just criminals and terrorists but necessarily, by the breadth of this bill, of everybody else—people who are not suspected of anything.
         </p>
         <p>
          There was a remarkable report produced by Mandiant about two years ago, and it is very rare that documents such as this would get put into the public domain. They spent months and months tracking an entity that they referred to as
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT" rel="nofollow">
           APT
          </a>
          1—advanced persistent threat 1—operating out of an office block in Shanghai that they argued was a unit of the Chinese military, and it appeared that its entire sole purpose of existence was industrial espionage on a massive scale. This entity appeared to be entering corporate data systems and government databases around the world using a mix of technical and social engineering techniques to gain access to systems to set up small encampments inside people's databases and then systematically loop and withdraw material, some of it quite sensitive, for purposes that I suppose we can only guess at. This kind of stuff happens on an extraordinary scale, and it is obviously not just the records of ordinary Australians that are going to be stored but everybody all the way up to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
           CEO
          </a>
          s of blue-chip corporations and their families will be caught up in this legislation—personal records; private and confidential communications of a presumably very sensitive nature from a business perspective. We are proposing that all that material be hosted and preserved for the first time in a really systematic way, and we are also forcing the providers to make it much easier to access and withdraw and bring it out. I suspect that is where Mr Irvine was heading with his cyber nationalism. It is his view that telcos should be forced to create this data, and obviously that is where we part ways. His view is that, if it is going to be created, we had better make sure we look after it as well as we can and a server somewhere else in the world, goodness knows where, subject to goodness knows what kind of technical protection measures, may not be the best place for it.

          will be supporting Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment. Senator Brandis acknowledged before that the government does not have a closed mind on this issue and that it may be something that is revisited in the course of the review that you alluded to before. In supporting this amendment, and that of the Australian Greens that is to follow, I would also acknowledge that it is likely to increase costs. It is likely to be more expensive; that is precisely the reason that some of the ISPs may well want to outsource this elsewhere. They would be doing that because of cost. That means that if we require them to host this material in Australia that may well have a material financial impact on the bill. I would like to hear from Senator Brandis how costs are being factored in and how he can proclaim confidence about material hosted elsewhere that may well be subject to Australian privacy law but is subject to a much lower standard of technical protection, and whether this would be dealt with in that six-month period where ISPs and telcos are going to be required to submit their implementation plans, whether data security of where they are proposing to host these new categories of material will be a material fact and whether the government is aware that this may indeed increase costs if it is held locally.

           I am not sure why Senator Ludlam was necessarily waiting for the opposition to contribute at this stage, but I will put our position on the record and correct some of his misunderstandings about how some matters are to proceed. I am sure Senator Brandis will follow with respect to the remainder of his questions. As I said in my speech on the second reading, Labor holds concerns about offshore storage of data retained under this scheme. However, the appropriate avenue for resolving these concerns is, as the joint committee noted, through the broader telecommunications sector security reform process—a process that Labor established and that the government has agreed is the appropriate avenue to address these concerns. There is sufficient time within the implementation period for this to occur, and that is where Labor will be focusing our efforts.

            The government also opposes this amendment, for reasons that I largely explained yesterday so I will not detain the Senate by speaking for too long. The comments of Mr David Irvine, the former Director-General of Security, have been referred to several times in this debate. It is not merely the case, Senator Ludlam, that Mr Irvine is a supporter of mandatory data retention, which of course he is. Mr Irvine is a supporter of this particular bill. He considers this particular bill meets all of his objectives; in fact, he, probably more than any other witness to the first PJCIS inquiry during the last parliament, was the principal advocate of a mandatory data retention regime. Indeed so frustrated was Mr Irvine by the misrepresentation of remarks attributed to him by a journalist that he contacted my office last week and authorised me to convey that it was his wish that this bill in this form should be passed. Nothing that he said at that seminar and nothing in the words attributed to him by a journalist should be understood to derogate from his view that this bill in the form in which the government presents it to the chamber was the appropriate bill for the chamber to pass.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to cost, you are right, Senator Ludlam: of course companies will look for the lowest-cost option as they always do—that is the way capitalism works. They should do that and they will do that. That is why we must have an appropriately robust framework of laws to ensure that the search for the least-cost option in fulfilling the statutory obligation does not compromise data security.
           </p>
           <p>
            The telecommunications providers, the internet service providers, which are subject to the obligation created by this bill, are subject to Australian law not just to the obligations created by this bill but to other relevant Australian laws, including the provisions of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Privacy Act
            </a>
            to which I referred the chamber last night in the context of the discussion of this issue—and which I will not repeat but with which I am sure, Senator Ludlam, you are familiar. And, as I foreshadowed in my contribution last night, the telecommunications sector security reform—which the government has been working with great effort to develop and which we expect to introduce into the parliament in the second half of this year—the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSSR" rel="nofollow">
             TSSR
            </a>
            legislation, is specifically designed to create a very robust, very reliable, framework for the protection and the security of data and of networks.
           </p>
           <p>
            The suggestion that seems to come from you, Senator Ludlam, that there is a zero-sum game in which every incremental reduction in cost is associated, invariantly, with an incremental reduction in the security of data is wrong. As long as the relevant companies are observant of their legal obligations and as long as the legal framework is sufficiently robust, then we would expect players in a marketplace to gravitate to the least-cost option consistent with their legal obligations. That is the way in which this has been structured.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not really think I need to say anything more about the matter. This is, as you said yourself, Senator Ludlam, a borderless environment, so it is, if I may say so, a little simple-minded to suggest that in a borderless environment we should be as conscious of national borders as you seem to be. But what we should be conscious of is the robustness of the legal framework which we have and which the legislation, which I foreshadowed, will further augment.

             amendment (6) is slightly at odds with the way in which Senator Leyonhjelm sought to do this. Nonetheless, I think we will just withdraw the amendment and move onto the next one. I move amendment (7) on sheet 7669:

            <p>
             Australian Greens amendment (7) relates to the introduction of data after the retention period. This is an amendment that requires telcos to destroy retained data after the mandatory retention period, unless that data is explicitly required for building purposes. What it effectively does is set the two-year minimum threshold that the Australian government is proposing to establish for new material, recognising, as I think a number of speakers have pointed out, that some service providers keep some categories of material for much longer than that.
            </p>
            <p>
             An overall data destruction amendment would not make much sense. I have got personal email records—and I am sure most of us have—going back much longer than two years. I am certainly not interested in the service provider wiping them, but categories of material that have been brought into being for the sole purpose of the objects of this bill should be subject to an explicit data destruction policy. So materials that are recorded for longer than two years for billing purposes and materials that are recorded for longer than two years for all sorts of legitimate reasons, obviously, would not be subject to this amendment. Material that is only being brought into being to satisfy the government and the opposition's objectives should not hang around forever.
            </p>
            <p>
             I might be so bold as to anticipate an objection that Senator Brandis might raise: why would service providers hang onto it, if we are making these arguments that it is so immensely costly? But, of course, most of the costs are in the set-up, creating the space for it in the first place. I suspect keeping it for longer would be of marginally much lower cost. What we would like to do is ensure that material that was forced into being solely for the purpose of a mandatory data retention scheme, which we do not believe is necessary, is not then hanging around in the ether for longer than that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Without an explicit data destruction policy, the default would be that many telcos would be likely to retain data beyond the two-year mandatory data retention period. We do not want to see that two-year period become indefinite, even though some records, as I have identified, would be indefinite. I would like to get a read from the Attorney-General of what his understanding is of the way that the bill is presently structured. Is my suspicion correct that there would be no obligation as the bill is currently drafted for material to be destroyed or deleted if it has been brought into purpose solely for the legal obligation as set out in this bill?

              Yes, you are correct, Senator Ludlam: the bill does not provide for or create a destruction obligation after the expiry of the two-year retention period. Although you say that your proposed amendment relies upon a sole purpose test, it does not. If you wanted to change your amendment by altering the words in subclause (a) by inserting the words, 'solely for the purpose of compliance with' rather than 'in accordance with' then we would still vote against your amendment, but that would be a sole purpose test. This is not your fault, Senator Ludlam; it is drafting error, I suspect. However, your amendment does not do what you think it does. That being said, I feel the force of the argument; it was considered, as well, by the PJCIS.
             </p>
             <p>
              For reasons that I expounded upon earlier in the day, it is unlikely that telcos and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP" rel="nofollow">
               ISP
              </a>
              s would want to retain data for longer than the statutory minimum period; their case is that that is a burdensome obligation. But it remains the case—were telcos and ISPs to choose, counterintuitively, to do so—that that is not against Australian law as it currently stands. In fact, when I had the discussion earlier today with Senator Leyonhjelm about variable retention periods, I pointed out that in some cases at the moment metadata is stored for up to seven years. That is not against the law. In any event, although this bill does not deal with the handling obligation; that is dealt with, in particular, by the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
               Privacy Act
              </a>
              , which requires entities to take reasonable steps to notify customers if their information will be disclosed to an overseas recipient, of the countries where the information will be held, and to ensure that any overseas recipient of personal information does not breach the Australian privacy principles.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lastly, might I point out, as I have done in another context, that it is by no means unusual for Australian law to mandate the retention of business records for more than two years. Under the Taxation Administration Act, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Taxation Office
              </a>
              requires business records that are relevant to a taxpayer's tax affairs to be retained for five years. Our law has not adopted a destruction obligation; what it has adopted is a handling obligation so as to protect the security of data that is retained.

               I might supplement that as well and highlight changes, related to this point, that have been made to the explanatory memorandum. Labor's view is this amendment is now unnecessary. We were alive to the suggestion that data which is retained only for the purposes of this scheme should be destroyed once the retention period expires. The

               </a>
               addressed this matter, recommending that the explanatory memorandum to the bill be amended to clarify the obligations of telcos in this regard. The revised explanatory memorandum clarifies that, as the Australian privacy principles apply to the scheme, telcos are obliged to destroy or de-identify data at the end of the retention period if there is no other acceptable purpose under privacy law for retaining it.

               <p>
                The bill sets up a new office of the Communications Access Coordinator, which will be responsible for accepting the plans which telcos make to implement the data retention legislation, and the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
                 ACMA
                </a>
                works with it on adjudication. I think that is the only role, really, that the ACMA plays—that is, compliance. Plans submitted by telcos for implementing the legislation would be sent to law enforcement agencies for comment, meaning that law enforcement would have a direct say in how these plans were implemented and a certain degree of subsequent control over how they operate. The feedback would not be made public and it would not even necessarily be made available to the service providers, meaning that the law enforcement agencies would have a behind-closed-doors feedback loop on how the data retention legislation would be implemented.
               </p>
               <p>
                This amendment would resolve that situation. It does not require publication. I kind of buy the argument, if the Attorney-General is prepared to run it, that the publication of these things would probably be quite risky. But at the very least, give the telcos copies of the feedback that has been provided by the law enforcement agencies. Otherwise, you effectively have
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                 ASIO
                </a>
                and a suite of other agencies—albeit a narrower range of agencies that can access this material now—being able to reach into the back office operations of every telecommunications service provider in the country and tell them how to run their affairs. For a government obsessed with deregulation, it is a remarkable reregulation of the telecommunications sector that particular companies could find themselves and their implementation plans effectively vetoed and forced to make certain changes without getting to see exactly what it is that is wrong with the proposals that they have put forward. In order to assist compliance with a bill like this, which many of these operators reject and have campaigned against quite strenuously, for reasons that are pretty obvious to everybody, it is remarkable that the government does not propose that those plans are at least returned to the telcos. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

                 The Communications Access Co-ordinator is of course a pre-existing role, not a role newly created by this bill. The provision which the bill introduces which is relevant to the metadata retention scheme, includes proposed section 187G(2):
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (2) If:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (a) the Communications Access Co-ordinator receives a comment from an enforcement agency or security authority requesting an amendment of the original plan; and
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (b) the Co-ordinator considers the request to be a reasonable one;
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 the Co-ordinator:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (c) must request that the service provider make the amendment within 30 days … after receiving the comment or summary; and
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (d) may give the service provider a copy of the comment or a summary of the comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are two points to be made about the provision in its current form. First, the request must be, in the judgement of the Communications Access Co-ordinator, a reasonable comment or request. Second, the coordinator may give the service provider a copy of the comment or summary. It is permissive, not mandatory, and the effect of your amendment, would be, as I read it, to change it from being permissive to mandatory. There is no prohibition on doing this. Ordinarily, I would expect that that is what would happen, because, as I have been at pains to say, this is an industry scheme that is going to work only if there is good collaboration and cooperation between the regulatory authorities and industry. However, there are circumstances in which it may not be appropriate for the Communications Access Co-ordinator to provide that material to a telco. The obvious circumstance is where the provision of that material might disclose information of a security character which it is not appropriate be disclosed or put into the public domain.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Proposed section 187G then sets out quite a detailed schema for balancing and governing the rights of the respective parties in the event that such a request was made, to which you did not refer. In particular, proposed subsection (4) of that section provides:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (4) If the service provider indicates that it does not accept a request for an amendment of the original plan, the Communications Access Co-ordinator must:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (a) refer the request and the service provider’s response to the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 —
                </p>
                <p>
                 the Australian Communications and Media authority; and—
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (b) request the ACMA to determine whether any amendment of the original plan is required.
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (5)The ACMA must then:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (a) determine in writing that no amendment of the original plan is required in response to the request for the amendment; or
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (b) if, in the opinion of the ACMA:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (i) the request for the amendment is a reasonable one; and
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 (ii) the service provider’s response to the request for the amendment is not reasonable;
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 determine in writing that the original plan should be amended in a specified manner and give a copy of the determination to the service provider.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So there is a right of appeal, in effect, to the ACMA. It is not as if the Communications Access Co-ordinator may merely dictate to a service provider on the basis of an agency comment or request. If it makes a determination which the service provider objects to or considers not to be reasonable then there is an arbitration or determination at arm's length from the Communications Access Co-ordinator by the ACMA, and the ACMA must give reasons and give a copy of the determination to the service provider. I think I am right in saying, but I will check for you and confirm, that a determination by the ACMA under proposed section 187G would itself be a judicially reviewable decision. Yes, I am told that that is right. That would be a judicially reviewable decision, so one could then go to the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
                  Administrative Appeals Tribunal
                 </a>
                 and one ultimately has recourse on points of law to the federal courts. So it is not as you say it is. In fact there is quite a detailed schema, as I have said, to protect the rights of the service provider in the event that such a request is given by the Communications Access Co-ordinator.

                  I should indicate that Labor will be opposing these amendments because we accept that, as Senator Brandis outlined, in some cases it will not be appropriate to do so. As he highlighted, it is certainly permissive, but there are some circumstances, including where the comment relates to sensitive law enforcement or national security matters, where it may not be appropriate. We accept that what has been structured here is in the appropriate form.

                   I will not press the argument, because it appears that, again, the numbers are against us. I thank the Attorney-General for clarifying the flow chart. It is useful to know exactly how he envisages it working in practice. I still find it remarkable that the only example—or counter-example, I guess—that you could give us as to why the agency feedback would not be passed on to the telecommunications providers as a matter of course is security. I would think that if the agencies had a problem relating to security about how service providers were proposing to implement their obligations, albeit unwillingly, that would somehow still be withheld from the service providers. We are not talking about publishing this material and putting it into the public domain; we are talking about the technicians and the people who are now suffering a legal obligation to do something they would rather not do to be able to receive directly feedback that the agencies were providing. It is remarkable, again, that a government that proposes deregulation in every other sphere be imposing such an enormously intrusive obligation. I understand and acknowledge Senator Brandis's outlining of the rights of appeal and so on, but, nonetheless, it must be observed that industry is doing this under duress. They have been fighting this proposal since—as far as I am aware—2008. So it is, at the very least, a measure of transparency between the intermediary within the

                   and industry. It would seem to me to be an issue of good faith, if nothing else. Unless other senators have comments, I will commend

                    I do not want to delay this, but I am advised that, in fact, industry supports the creation of the Communications Access Co-ordinator. You do have a very negative view of this I know, Senator Ludlam, but the reality is—as I keep trying to explain to you—this is an industry scheme, the efficacy of which depends to a very high degree on cooperation and indeed collaboration. And although it is theoretically possible, of course, that an occasion might arise where that spirit of collaboration or cooperation is absent, ordinarily we would not expect that to be the case. Ordinarily, we would expect the regulator and the service providers to be working together to ensure that the scheme works as well as it can be reasonably made to work. But, in those circumstances where they may be at odds with each other, and the service provider is of the view that an unreasonable view has been taken by the Communications Access Co-ordinator, then there is that right of appeal to the

                      I will speak to this reasonably briefly, and it will probably seem reasonably technical. These amendments ensure that exemptions which are sought—and I think Senator Brandis has mentioned in an earlier stage of the debate the ability of exemptions to be sought and received—should be uniform. For example, if one provider has
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPTV" rel="nofollow">
                       IPTV
                      </a>
                      services exempted, then this exemption would apply across the industry. Whatever else we might say about our security agencies, or those intermediaries within the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
                       ACMA
                      </a>
                      who are undertaking the implementation of this proposal, they are not necessarily specialists in competition in this very complex, fast-moving sector. The last thing that we want to do is inadvertently tilt the competitive playing field against one carrier over another because of an arbitrary decision such as this that creates a carve-out for one company which then is not applied fairly and competitively across the rest of the sector.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The intention here is deliberately to protect smaller players in the industry who may not have the funding to engage significantly with this new regulatory burden that is being placed over them. While I acknowledge that Senator Brandis has gone into a bit of detail around how this is going to work, this does overlay a new regulatory blanket over the industry, one that the government has been at pains—and the former government, for that matter, to give them their due—to deregulate. And so we do not want to see perverse outcomes, where exemptions sought by one player can convey a competitive advantage over others or where companies, through no fault of their own, find themselves disadvantaged by an exemption carved out by somebody else. So I would be very interested in the Attorney-General's views on why that is not a great idea—unless, of course, he thinks it is a great idea.

                       There is a very clear reason for proposed section 187K of the bill being structured in the way that it is, and that is because it provides the flexibility to grant exemptions on a class basis or on a case-by-case basis. Exceptions can either be provided by category or on a case-by-case basis to individual service providers. And I am a little taken aback, frankly, Senator Ludlam, by your critique, because I thought one of the points you were at pains to agitate in this debate was that there should be particular concern for the interests of the small
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP" rel="nofollow">

                       </a>
                       s—which the government agrees with. But the nature of the needs and the persuasiveness of the case put by an individual ISP for an exemption will depend upon that ISP's particular characteristics. I think it is quite wrong—I think it is from a methodological or even a logical point of view wrong—to say that, where one is considering whether exemptions ought to be granted, one ought to be limited only to granting exemptions to an entire class, although that class may contain quite a degree of variability within it; rather than to look at each individual, where appropriate, on a case-by-case basis. Proposed section 187K, as currently drafted, does both. Where there is a sufficient degree of uniformity among a particular class of like ISPs or service providers, then a class exemption can be granted of which all of them may be the beneficiary. But where there is a particular ISP which has unique features, so that it is appropriate to look at it and to look at its profile on an individuated basis, than the draft allows for that to happen too. And your amendment, Senator Ludlam, were it to be carried, would entirely remove the capacity to deal with an individual ISP with an individual or unique profile on an individuated basis. For that reason, the government frankly does not see the utility, even from the point of view of the argument you advance, Senator Ludlam, of your amendments and we do not support them.

                         This amends the governments grants provisions to state that the government must make a grant to telcos covering the additional costs to implement the data retention legislation as recommended by the PJCIS. This is a very serious amendment. It goes to some of the issues we traversed last night and a bit earlier today about the costs. I recognise that Senator Brandis is presumably bound up in an Expenditure Review Committee skirmish at the moment under fairly tight budget constraints. That is one of the reasons why we have no information as to how much the government's contribution is going to be. I would have thought that was an argument for delaying passage of the bill rather than progressing it, but that argument does not seem to have persuaded either the government or the opposition.

                           It is going to be both, as Senator Xenophon interjects quite correctly. But I think everybody has a reasonable expectation of being told before it passes into law rather than after what that balance is going to be—no-one more so than the same telecommunications providers who are going to have this impact on their bottom line. That is going to have, without doubt, an asymmetrical impact on the industry, because there are companies out there with hundreds of millions of dollars on their balance sheets competing against start-ups that might be only a couple of weeks old. That will also impact on the way companies make their argument when they come after the government to recover costs. I suspect that if you can afford some of the best

                           John Stanton put it the following way. He said:
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">
                           … it was unreasonable for the Government to push for the legislation to be passed into law before providing detail on its commitment to contribute to up-front capital costs that consultants estimate could cost more than $319 million.
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">
                           "We are not asking Senators to block the Bill, but simply to delay its passage until Government provides some detail about the contribution it has promised to make—given that telecommunication users will inevitably shoulder much of the burden of any Government shortfall," Mr Stanton said.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           …   …   …
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">
                           Mr Stanton said the Government should spell out the dollar value of its contribution, or at the very least the percentage of the total cost that it will contribute.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           So, Senator Brandis, maybe rather than continuing on I will ask you now whether the government has reconsidered its view that we ought to blindly pass this bill without having the faintest idea of how much of taxpayers' money the government will contribute. Or, if you are not willing to do that, could you at least put to us a rough proportion or percentage of the total cost that the government will contribute? Keep in mind that a lot of people—not 100 per cent, but a lot of the Australian population—strongly object to being forced to have their taxes go into being spied on. That is why it has come to be known as the surveillance tax. But at the very least let's find out the quantum or proportion of the surveillance tax. Any information that the Attorney-General is able to provide will contribute to and greatly assist the course of this public debate because the sum total of information you have put into the public domain thus far is approximately zero.

                            Senator Ludlam, just when I was beginning to respect your forensic analysis of these provisions you have launched into a rhetorical flight of fancy. But I will not follow you there. This is a very oddly drafted amendment because—and, again, this is probably a drafting issue rather than anything I can blame you for, Senator Ludlam—although it provides that proposed section 187KB of the bill be omitted and the following words substituted, in fact between what you propose and what is in the original bill there is a difference of only one word—and that is that the bill says 'may' and your proposed amendment says 'must'.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Senator Ludlam, the reason this entire discussion is otiose is that the government has already committed to doing so. Neither the provision in its original form nor your amendment quantifies the amount or identifies what proportion it ought to be. There is no quantification or allocation in the amendment that you propound, Senator Ludlam. You merely say that rather than it being permissive, that the government may make a contribution, the government must make a contribution. But the government is making a contribution. That has already been announced. It has already been agreed. It is well understood in the industry. Therefore, the amendment that you urge does nothing but require the government to do something that it has already undertaken to do. That is why I say your amendment is otiose.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            As to the quantum, there are a range of estimates. You choose for the purpose of advancing your argument, understandably, a figure at the top of the range—$319 million. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report to which I referred to last night suggests a credible range between $188 million and $390 million. That is not imprecise; it is not at all uncommon for people who place a value on economic activity to describe it by reference to a range.

                            government has committed to making a substantial contribution to those costs. Within that range, it will make a substantial contribution. What a 'substantial contribution' is is obviously a matter for discussion between government and industry. It is also a matter for internal decision within government. You yourself, Senator Ludlam, observed shrewdly that this is a matter that is at the moment part of the budget process. The government will make a judgement informed by the discussions that it has had with industry as to what proportion fairly represents a substantial contribution within that range.

                             Senator Brandis, you are forever helping my vocabulary! But, to stay on the point here, I can indicate that Labor accepts that the government has accepted the recommendation of the joint committee in its report, where it called on government to make a substantial contribution to the costs of telcos in meeting their obligations under the scheme. That being said, I think the points that I made in my second reading contribution about how this case could have better been managed applies here.

                              This is not a trick question to the Attorney, but I just wanted to ask whether there have been any representations or whether any consideration has been given as to whether the provisions of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution in respect of acquisition of property on just terms could potentially be a legal argument that could be used by some of the telco providers in terms of the metadata regime that is being proposed. I am hoping that the answer is no.

                               Senator Xenophon, you can be reassured that all relevant considerations have been had regard to by the government. The learning and case law on section 51(xxxi), which is about the acquisition of property, is, as the High Court has said—actually quite recently, again—premised upon the notion of a transfer of title, not merely the imposition of an obligation. There must be some transfer of ownership, and that is not the case here.

And we just have to take you on your word that those are the figures. How is this scheme going to work then? On budget day in early May, are we going to be looking back on tonight's debate, with an amount of money that is patently inadequate, and should we not therefore heed the call of the entire telecommunications industry, bar one or two—

                                   Senator Ludlam, if I may say so, your memory is too short. When I first sat in the Senate during the Howard government, it was not the case that budgets were very tight. In fact, in all but one of the budgets delivered by my former colleague Mr Peter Costello there was a very substantial surplus. I remember the late, great
                                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Price" rel="nofollow">

                                   making an observation about one of the last Costello budgets that budgets were like birthdays those days; the public so looked forward to them. In those happy days of the Howard government, when the economic affairs of the nation were conducted competently, there was a rolling surplus budget for more than a decade. But that is a political point, I unashamedly concede. Senator Ludlam, you need to get out more if you think that letter is the most extraordinary letter you have ever read. I get more extraordinary letters than that on a daily basis, I can promise you.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Being a little more serious, Senator Ludlam, because I am teasing you, I know, industry will have certainty—of course industry will have certainty—because, at the appropriate time, the government will announce the proportionate contribution that it will make. In his second reading speech on 30 October 2014, Mr Turnbull, in the other place, committed the government to making a substantial contribution to the capital costs. The determination of what the capital costs are will be informed, among other things, by the range estimated by the PwC report of between $188 and $319 million. The government will make a substantial contribution to an appropriate figure within that range.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   What that substantial contribution will be has not yet been determined. It has not yet been determined, but I can tell you that it is close to being determined. That determination has been informed by long discussion with industry. It is, as you yourself have shrewdly observed, part of the budget process. The budget is being delivered on 12 May. It does not create uncertainty for industry merely to say to them: 'We will be announcing at a date in the near future the precise proportionate contribution that the government will be making to help meet the obligation provided for by proposed section 187KB.'

                                    The rationale for this amendment is to provide the opportunity for more widespread and more public debate and review, particularly in light of the fact that the PJCIS includes no members of the crossbench or Greens. To that end, this amendment carves out from the sunset the bill's review of operation provision section 187(9) by the PJCIS but ensures that if the bill sunsets and comes to be re-enacted, it will be debated by all of us in this place. It is also Liberal Democratic Party policy that, if draconian laws are to be enacted, they be sunsetted. It is part of the liberal tradition that fewer, better-drafted laws be enacted. Forcing parliaments to revisit earlier bad law goes some way towards achieving this, if only by reminding parliament not to produce rubbish laws in the first place.

                                     The government opposes this amendment. Proposed section 187N provides for quite a detailed scheme for the review of the operation of the relevant part of the act. The review was to be conducted by the
                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">

                                     . The period by which the review must commence and by which it must be concluded, which are both in the near future, are specified. It is routinely the role of the PJCIS to review the operation of legislation of a national security character, which is what this legislation is. It would be unusual—I am not sure if it would be unprecedented, but it would certainly be unusual—for the review of legislation of this kind to be conducted by any other organ of the parliament other than the PJCIS. Its reports, of course, are public and will be able to be debated in this chamber at the appropriate time. The government sees no persuasive reason for departing from the orthodox position that when one is dealing with the review of operation of new elements of national security legislation, the PJCIS is the appropriate organ to conduct that review.

                                        , I indicate that we support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment for the reasons that he has expressed quite eloquently for a while. The PJCIS was quite literally a boys' club when Mr Clare and Mr Dreyfus substituted on it to more closely observe the bill that they had carriage of on behalf of the opposition. It was a committee comprised entirely of middle-aged white men.
                                       </p>

                                        The government, having eliminated the crossbench spot, I would at least pay tribute—and I think Senator Brandis was part of this committee when he was there—to the role that Mr Andrew Wilkie played as somebody who had spent some considerable years as a member of the intelligence community as the crossbench member of the PJCIS. That crossbench spot, which has never been held by the Greens, was eliminated by this government when they came to power. Since then it has operated as something of a closed shop.
                                       </p>

                                        I think this parliament, as Senator Leyonhjelm has identified in this amendment, is by far a more appropriate place to hold the debate on the sunsetting of a bill with the gravity of this. Unwinding data retention provisions of a future parliament if one moved to do so, I think, this is a serious conversation that should be held in this parliament. It is certainly going to be, technically and procedurally, potentially quite difficult to do. The PJCIS is not at all the appropriate place to do so. Too frequently it has acted as a captive. I have seen any number of interviews that the present chair of the committee has conducted where he is asked for a rationale of why he has come to one view or another, and he just says, 'Because

                                        said so,' or 'Because the Federal Police want it.'

                                       <p>
                                        It is not the role of an oversight committee to simply act as some kind of relay service for demands of the intelligence community or the police. No matter how hard they work or how diligently they carry out their duties, it is the role of that committee principally and of this parliament in general to balance the demands of agencies seeking more powers to conduct their responsibilities and the expectations of the citizenry as a whole, so we do not end up living in a police state. Quite frankly, the PJCIS, in my view, has not always upheld that extraordinarily important responsibility, and I would argue that the shape this bill has arrived in tonight is precisely an example of how that committee has let us down.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        Obviously it is a matter of record, but I do not believe this bill should pass into law at all. If we are going to be debating sunset provisions and the fact that at some stage we might expect that this thing is withdrawn from the statute books, the place for that debate to happen is this parliament. We will be supporting the amendment.

                                         I could not let Senator Ludlam's reference to the gender issue go by without some comment. We do have one other female senator participating to some extent in this debate. It would be remiss of me not to highlight that the two Labor participants on the joint committee vacated their positions so that the relevant frontbenchers could ensure that Labor applied diligent consideration to this bill. Those committee members were Senator Wong and Ms Plibersek.

                                         From my observations of the debate today I am really quite confused about what Senator Ludlam thinks might be the gender issues that are relevant. I would also have to disagree significantly with his characterisation of the committee's considerations. The recommendations, and the 74 consequent amendments that the government has accepted, highlight the detailed consideration and the good work done by this committee.

                                          The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is arguably the most respected committee of the parliament, and always has been. It is usually, or in general, comprises the most senior members drawn from both sides of politics. And at the time this proposal was developed, Senator Ludlam, it also contained an Independent, Mr Andrew Wilkie—by the way, another middle-aged white man—whose views you seem not to find as offensive, notwithstanding his exotic gender, age demographic and ethnicity.

And it is very poor form of you, Senator, to reflect upon the committee.

                                           I do not want my position in respect of the American system to be misrepresented. There are many things about the American system that I have real concerns about, but I do give credit to the Americans that in so far as there appears to be a greater level of scrutiny—including a court, albeit sitting in secret—in terms of intelligence matters. I do not think I am verballing the Attorney-General by saying that he is nodding. It is a different system but the principles are the same: our intelligence services ought to be subject to a decent level of scrutiny. And I do not think that is idiotic, whether you are quoting

There are nine separate groupings—10 Greens and eight separate members representing different groups or different independent perspectives. And it worries me that they are not represented.

Would he consider, from the government's point of view, giving an opportunity for crossbenchers to be participating members on certain inquiries from time to time if there is a resolution of this place in order to allow that participation.

                                            It is not really my place to reflect upon the composition of the PJCIS other than to make the point that it comprises, generally, senior and respected members from both sides of politics. When Mr Wilkie was a member of the PJCIS in the last parliament I thought he made a useful and well-informed contribution to its deliberations, for which I thank him. As I said, the genesis of the bill we are debating tonight was the inquiry in which Mr Wilkie was a participant. The report which was the genesis of this bill was a unanimous report. I would be the last person, Senator, to depreciate the value of Independent crossbench members of parliament.

                                             Is that why you knocked him off the committee? I am perplexed as to the point you are trying to make. I would agree that he did make a valuable contribution to the committee. I therefore wonder—maybe this is seen as a bit of a digression—why you knocked him off the committee.

Whether an independent or a crossbench member or a minor-party member should have a permanent spot is a debate that one could have, as one often debates the composition of committees. The composition of the committee, at the moment, is as it is and I think it has done a very good job.

                                                   We had this debate last night in the early committee stages, and I fundamentally disagree with what Senator Leyonhjelm has said. Senator Leyonhjelm is fearful that the authorities will devote their resources to pursuing relatively trivial or inconsequential offences or regulatory breaches. It is not conceivable, as a matter of common sense, that they would do so.
                                                  </p>

                                                   The purpose of this legislation is to enable the capacity of the law enforcement, the national security agencies and, in addition, the principal economic regulators—the

                                                   and ASIC—to investigate and apprehend serious crime. That is what they are going to do. You say, Senator Leyonhjelm, 'What if they pursue a trivial matter?' As a matter of common sense, that is unlikely. But, equally, it is bad legislative practice to prescribe in legislation thresholds above or below which law enforcement agencies should exercise their investigative powers. That is just bad practice.

                                                   The issue was looked at by the second PJCIS report, the one that reported on 27 March. Let me read into the record the conclusions of the committee at paragraph 6.187 and the following two:

The Committee also notes the complexities in balancing the competing public interests of individual privacy with enforcement of the law and protection of national security.

As Senator Brandis highlighted, the

But it did recommend, as it recommended in 2013, that there be a further examination of whether and how the various thresholds in the T(

                                                    This goes to the point that I made in my second reading contribution—that in some respects we have the cart before the horse. Had the government proceeded with the recommendations around the T(IA) Act, our considerations here might have been facilitated. So, unfortunately, this amendment is premature without that consideration by the parliamentary joint committee. For that reason, Labor will not be supporting it.

                                                       is so concerned and then perhaps ask the Attorney to expand on why he does not agree with it. The committee's recommendation that retained data be accessed only for the purposes of investigating complex or serious offences is not reasonably characterised as imposing an arbitrary threshold on access to retained data; rather, such a requirement would ensure that the scheme in fact did not represent an arbitrary and disproportionate limitation on the right to privacy. The concern that I have and that the committee has, as expressed in its report, is that while the Attorney-General seeks to reassure us that, although there are very wide and potential broad uses of the retained data under this bill, we are not to worry about it because the agencies would not waste their time accessing that data for trivial reasons, the trouble is that there is nothing to prevent that in the act, as far as my understanding goes.

                                                        Attorney, I am somewhat bewildered. You have told us that the metadata retention regime is only to be used for investigation or enforcement of serious offences. The PJCIS says that is what it is intended to be used for. My amendment says nothing more than a disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement—not even the investigation, but the enforcement—of a serious contravention, and I understand 'serious contravention' is understood, of the law. What exactly is the problem?

                                                           I think I dealt with that, if I may say so, when I tried to answer your question the first time. It is a question of proportionality, you are right. The purpose of these amendments is to deal with serious crime, that is true. The principle of proportionality is enshrined in the bill. This was looked at by the PJCIS and I read to you the PJCIS's considerations that led them to conclude that the way in which the matter had been dealt with by the bill was appropriate. I agree with the process of reasoning of the PJCIS. I do not think your amendment is necessary, and I do not really think I can take it any further.

Most member states—not all, but most—including the United Kingdom, I might say, with whose Attorney-General I have discussed this matter, have subsequently enacted complying data retention schemes. The point I make is that the issue is one of proportionality, as the European Court of Human Rights recognised, and an appropriately crafted mandatory metadata retention scheme can be, and in the European case is, human rights compliant. Proportionality is one of the values that underlie this bill and the way in which the bill will be given effect to by the agencies, and I am quite satisfied, by parody of reasoning with the European Human Rights Court in the case of the European data directive, that this bill is also compliant.

We know that metadata can reveal very significant information about a person's life, associations, habits and preferences and therefore significantly limits the right to privacy. But this proposed scheme would allow access to metadata for two years for the investigation of minor offences, including offences attracting only monetary penalties. Am I right, or is that wrong?

In my own field of professional experience in trade practices law, until very recently, there were only monetary civil penalties available under the

I think in anyone's language conduct like that is a very, very serious breach of the law, but the penalties were only monetary. So the fact that the penalties may only be monetary does not indicate at all that the conduct being investigated is not grave.

The bill contains an obligation and it limits by three-quarters the number of agencies which can have access to metadata and it limits in various ways, which are not part of the present law, the capacity of those agencies to access that metadata. It contains new oversight measures and protections, which we debated last night, and it is a little tedious to have to repeat the point I made to you ad nauseam last night.
                                                                  </p>

I explained before that proportionality is one of the values enshrined in the act. I did not give you the section reference: there it is.

What do you say then to the fact that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights states that the committee considers that the response that you provided to that committee in response to requests for information that was made about this very issue of proportionality has not established that these kinds of minor crimes warrant the extent and degree of interference with the right to privacy that the scheme imposes.

We are inserting a range of new considerations to which regard is to be had but, most particularly for the purposes of your inquiry and, indeed, Senator Leyonhjelm's inquiry, the new criterion specified in (i) is:

It is really, I suppose, to make sure that it is clearly on the record that the joint committee of this parliament which was established to assess legislation as against Australia's international law obligations has recommended that to avoid the disproportionate limitation on the right to privacy that would result from disclosing telecommunications data for the investigation of any offence, the bill be amended to limit disclosure authorisation for existing data to instances where it is reasonably necessary for the investigation of specified serious crimes; categories of serious crimes; or the investigation of serious matters by the

This is a piece of legislation which has a law enforcement and national security purpose. It has been examined by the PJCIS. That is a committee with the expertise in this particular field, and it is a bipartisan committee which has twice now unanimously reported on this.

Furthermore, the fact that data are retained and subsequently used without the subscriber or registered user being informed is likely to generate in the persons concerned a feeling that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance.
                                                                       </p>

The cold-blooded way in which Senator Brandis has just gone ahead and said he has set aside the views where these issues are looked at through a human rights lens and wholeheartedly adopted the views of the committee that looks at these things through a lens of what
                                                                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

I am glad that he brought it forward, in that he is effectively—I am paraphrasing a little bit—arguing that data retention could well have been considered proportionate by the European courts had the way that the directive was implemented at a national level in national parliaments and congresses been done a little bit differently. It is an important point and it is one on which Senator Brandis is quite correct. But when the court was considering proportionality, it considered a couple of issues as to whether national parliaments and legislatures had to take proportionality into account. The grounds, from which I will quote very briefly, are fascinating. I quote again from the press statement:
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p class="italic">
                                                                        Firstly, the directive covers, in a generalised manner, all individuals, all means of electronic communication and all traffic data without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective of fighting against serious crime.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        What do you know? One of the proportionality thresholds that the European court thought was important and that Senator Brandis just brought to our attention is effectively gravity of conduct, that if you are going to place the population under blanket surveillance the measures should really only be used in light of the objective of fighting serious crime. Senator Brandis, in the same breath, rejected Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment that would effectively deal with that issue of proportionality. The judgement continues:
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p class="italic">
                                                                        Secondly, the directive fails to lay down any objective criterion which would ensure that the competent national authorities have access to the data and can use them only for the purposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions concerning offences that, in view of the extent and seriousness of the interference with the fundamental rights in question, may be … sufficiently serious to justify such an interference.
                                                                       </p>

                                                                       </p>

                                                                       </p>

                                                                       </p>

                                                                       </p>

There is no chance that the Australian bill as presently legislated would pass the threshold tests that were stated in black and white by the European courts. Feel free to unload, Senator Brandis. I have no doubt that you are quite looking forward to it.

It did not decide, in fact it specifically said that it was not deciding, that a mandatory data retention regime, properly designed, was contrary to European human rights standards. So it struck down that particular mandatory data retention regime embodied in the European data directive on the ground that, to use the vernacular, it went too far—it violated the test of proportionality. But, at the same time, it held that states could develop mandatory metadata retention regimes that would not violate the test of proportionality or otherwise violate the European human rights charter.

It is not identical to the amendment that was just disposed of, but if the Labor Party has pre-emptively decided to fold and the Attorney-General has pre-emptively decided to ignore the evidence then I do not think it is worth persisting with it. Our amendment substantially traverses the same matters that we have just been debating at length in Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment, so we will withdraw amendment (21).

That is why I have called them in these amendments 'protected class warrants', as in protected under the ordinary laws of evidence. To that end, I have imported the definition of 'journalist' used in the Evidence Act 1995 and which is used in other legislation in shield laws.
                                                                               </p>

I am aware that the Australian Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance is unhappy with the complete exclusion of bloggers. Even my warrants regime would not address all that organisations concerns; however, as I have said repeatedly, even if all my amendments were passed this would still be bad law. I have done my best within the constraints of the bill before us today.
                                                                               </p>

Law societies throughout the country have pointed out that retained metadata could allow inferences that undermine legal professional privilege to be drawn—when a given lawyer has been contacted, the identity and location of clients and witnesses, the number and type of communications and so on. The scenario repeatedly presented—and highly likely, in my view—is that, when a whistleblower seeks legal advice before contacting a journalist, as the bill currently stands the journalist's communication may be confidential but the lawyer is exposed. The information obtained, of course, could be used in the interviewing of a suspect as evidence tending to indicate guilt.
                                                                               </p>

Although they have not represented themselves to me as strongly as lawyers and journalists, I have also included health practitioners as defined in Commonwealth law. Doctors know the most intimate details of their patients' personal lives, so it seems bizarre that they not be protected by a warrants regime as well. I should note in particular that amendment (17) allows the class of protected persons to be added to. This bill is extremely intrusive and I could well imagine an addition to the class becoming necessary at some point in the future.
                                                                               </p>

Amendment (11) is a name change. Amendment (13), which we will be dealing with subsequently, inserts the definition of 'journalist' from the Evidence Act 1995. Amendment (14) is a name change. Amendment (15) inserts the definition of 'protected class' from the Evidence Act. Amendment (16) inserts a definition of 'source' from existing shield laws. Amendment (17) allows the class of protected persons to be added to. Amendments (18), (19), (20) and (21) are name changes.
                                                                               </p>

Amendment (22) marks the commencement of a detailed instruction of my proposed protected class warrants regime. The steps to be undertaken are clearly set out in the document circulated in my name. However, I will provide some background to what I am proposing. I do add the caveat that the system I propose is far from ideal—the government gets to choose the public interest advocates, for example—but it does represent a genuine improvement.
                                                                               </p>

I recognise that an intelligence agency has a different, albeit sometimes overlapping, role from the police and other law enforcement agencies. To that end, proposed sections 180G, 180K and 180L adapt the system of ministerial authorisations already in the bill but introduce further safeguards, including an enhanced role for the public interest advocates and a stronger public interest test. I have also been particularly concerned to ensure that the buck always stops with an elected person—in this case, the relevant minister. It is quite improper for an unelected civil servant to be making decisions of this nature. Proposed sections 180H, 180Q and 180R, by contrast, apply to enforcement bodies other than ASIO and take a more familiar form. Once again I have introduced more safeguards and oversight, enhanced the role of the public interest advocates and developed a strong public interest test.
                                                                               </p>

As it stands, the penalty is two years and there is no public interest defence. This is clearly meant to prevent journalists from talking to each other and, in certain respects, to participate in their own surveillance. However, I recognise that the offence protects those whose information is being accessed from having that fact disclosed to the world, the disclosure which, in itself, could be prejudicial to the person concerned. Once the warrants scheme is expanded, as I propose, then there are legitimate reasons why the existence of a warrant should not be disclosed—that is, prejudicing the investigation or reputational damage to the targeted person. In order to balance these legitimate public interests against public debate about the operation of the data retention scheme, I have also amended 182B to include a further exception, namely, an exception where the disclosure i

At an earlier stage in the committee debate, all of the issues raised by these amendments were addressed, and I do not want to detain the Senate by rehearsing at length arguments that we canvassed for more than an hour last night. But let me briefly summarise why the government does not support these amendments.
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  The bill in the form in which it ultimately came to the Senate contained in division 4C a very thorough system of protections for journalists and their sources. Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments would go further, but it is the view of the government that the legislation in its current form fully protects those interests. It does so in several ways. Firstly, unlike access to the metadata of any other citizen, access to the metadata of a journalist has to be by warrant. Secondly, there is a special procedure specified or mandated for accessing the metadata of a journalist that does not apply to any other citizen. First of all, authorisation to seek a warrant to access the metadata has to be made by the minister. That does not apply to any other citizen. Then an application has to be made to a court.
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  When a decision is made by ministerial authorisation for the issuance of a warrant for access to a journalist's metadata, a long series of tests that apply to no other citizen apply in the case of a journalist. The test, for example, which the minister must have regard to before authorising an application for a warrant against a journalist, which is set out in proposed section 180L(2), deals extensively with the public interest. So you say you are proposing a public interest test, Senator Leyonhjelm, but a public interest test—a very thorough public interest test—is already in the legislation. Lastly, by proposed section 180X, there is uniquely created the role of a public interest advocate.
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  In no other area of the law, where information is accessible upon the issuance of a warrant, is there provision for a public interest advocate to enter the argument and maintain why a warrant ought to be issued. This is unique; it is unique to this legislation and it is unique to journalists. Those four respects—the requirement for a warrant in the first place, the requirement of a double application to the minister and the courts, the public interest test and the unique office of public interest advocate—are protections that exist nowhere else in the laws governing access to metadata that apply to journalists, which the government has introduced.
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  Senator Leyonhjelm, you ask rhetorically whether the public interest advocate is going to be appointed by the government, as if that is a shocking thing. Who else is it going to be appointed by? The executive government appoints statutory officers. For those reasons, we do not agree with the additional provisions that you would have us adopt in relation to journalists. The thing that your amendment does, and it lacks any rational basis, is the introduction of the so-called protected class warrant to extend beyond journalists to lawyers and doctors and their respective clients and patients. I explained this last night, Senator Leyonhjelm; let me have another go. Although the government did not initially think it was necessary to have these provisions about journalists, I understand the point that access to metadata could reveal a journalist's source. It could, because metadata includes, for example, telephone numbers so that if a particular journalist telephoned a particular source—although the content of that conversation could not be accessed because of the prohibition against accessing conduct in section 187A—nevertheless it would be enough to reveal or expose the journalist's source, if the fact of the communication between the journalist and the source were able to be established.
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  In relation to the lawyer-client privilege, the thing that is protected is what passes between the lawyer and client. What information the client gives lawyer for the purposes of seeking advice and what advice the lawyer gives the client are not secrets. Which lawyer acts for which client is not governed by legal professional privilege. That is usually a matter of public record; certainly in a court case it is. The interest that is protected by the lawyer-client privilege is content, not identity; and, as I have explained to you ad nauseam, Senator Leyonhjelm, this bill contains an explicit prohibition on access to content, so there is absolutely no prejudice to the principles of lawyer-client privilege or legal professional privilege, as it used to be known, by this legislation because that which those principles seek to protect are already protected by the prohibition on access to content. By the way, lawyer-client privilege operates primarily as an exclusionary rule of the law of evidence. So, even if in some manner that I cannot conceive of, this were able to be obtained, it could never be admitted into evidence in proceedings because it is an exclusionary rule.
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  The third category of information you seek to include is doctors and their patients. That has never been regarded by the law as being on the same footing with the relationship between lawyers and their clients as a class of information which the law will protect. It is revealing that you are not able to refer to any statute which enshrines that principle in your draft amendment. I thought perhaps there may be such statutory provision in some Australian state or Territory—I am not aware of any, but it is certainly not the general law. Senator Leyonhjelm, the reasons we would protect journalists' sources—that is, to conceal their identity—are already served by the government's amendments in part 4C. The reason we do not support extending the amendment to the relationship between lawyers and clients is because the interest that protects, content, is already categorically prohibited from being accessed under the bill.

I will explain why in a moment, but for us this is very much a fallback measure. We are persuaded, and I will speak to it when we get to it on the running sheet, by the government's protections, adopted with massive reluctance. Let's acknowledge that you, Senator Brandis and the government, were dragged kicking and screaming to these amendments as a result of negotiations, which broke down after the PJCIS had already concluded and which dragged on and delayed Senate debate for the better part of last week. Since Mr Dreyfus has joined us for the remainder of this evening's debate, let's give credit where it is due; you did not want these provisions in the bill. You had to be dragged kicking and screaming to put them in the bill. The PJCIS made no such recommendations. Those negotiations were conducted entirely outside the ambit of the committee. So it is remarkable that you come in here ensuring us that we have protection for journalists and sources when you did not want them in the bill. In fact, the Prime Minister—and I suspect yourself, too—had said that you do not believe these amendments should exist at all, that you only did it in order to get the compliance of the

Shortly I will be introducing and debating an amendment that would require and provide, as 11 or 12 jurisdictions in Europe do at the moment, a level of judicial oversight for access to telecommunications data or metadata. I will speak to that amendment in detail when we get there.
                                                                                  </p>

If our amendment for getting a warrant across the whole population fails, because that is what I believe the law should provide, then we would effectively propose a protected class warrant as is proposed here by Senator Leyonhjelm, and by us later on the running sheet.

Law enforcement agencies should need a warrant to access the metadata of these so-called protected professionals. Also, we believe the role of the public interest advocate, which crudely mirrors the role of public interest monitors in Queensland and Victoria, should apply to a wider range of professionals than journalists. People more eloquent than myself and people who have got long experience in the press gallery here and elsewhere have quite sharply critiqued the amendments. They said that effectively you have made a tougher front door and you have thrown some procedural hurdles in the way of warrantless access of journalists' metadata, but of course the back door is wide open.

No warrants need to be applied for as the back door is still, in fact, wide open.

Actually, I would call into question the actions of a government that suddenly seems to be so interested in tracking down journalists' sources. Senator Brandis, I think you were among those who voted unanimously for Commonwealth shield laws to provide protection precisely against that kind of behaviour. But of course, warrantless metadata access to potential sources makes these shield laws almost obsolete. This proposition that Senator Leyonhjelm has advanced extends these protections—inadequate as I would argue that they are—to other classes of professionals including lawyers. We did traverse this briefly last night, so I will not detain us for long. The President of the

The confidentiality of client-lawyer communication is a long-held common law right and we need to be vigilant to protect it. It is not difficult to envisage situations where client-lawyer telecommunications data would reveal a range of information that could compromise confidentiality and even legal professional privilege.
                                                                                  </p>

So Mr Duncan is absolutely well aware that it is simply telecommunications data or metadata that has been caught here, rather than content. I think, Senator Brandis, that you went to that in an earlier comment.
                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                  </p>

Under the proposed amendments, the journalist's communication may be confidential, but what of the communications between a journalist or journalist's source and the lawyer? Data could allow inferences to be drawn from whether a lawyer has been contacted; the identity and location of the client, lawyer and witnesses; the number of communications and type of communications between a lawyer and a client, witnesses and the duration of these communications.
                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                   In many cases it is very important to keep confidential and protect even the fact that a lawyer is in contact with particular people. Any mass retention of communications data between lawyers and their clients could threaten the necessary trust between lawyers and their clients, allow an issue of sensitivity to be inferred or revealed and undermine the ability of lawyers to advocate on behalf of their clients.
                                                                                  </p>

We are well aware that agencies that would be enabled by this bill not merely to continue the status quo. Let us get that out of the way, because this is the status quo that prevails at law at this time, I am very well aware of that. What the government and the opposition are proposing to do is to bolt on new warehouses of material that do not exist at the present time, thus entrenching a very bad situation.
                                                                                  </p>

They can then potentially cross-match that with other records such as open-source social media publication, for example, and various other kinds of material—all of it without a single warrant needing to be issued. That is why we believe that journalists and their sources should not only be covered; lawyers should be covered and medical professionals should be covered.
                                                                                  </p>

We would have moved it in a slightly different way if our amendment had been dealt with first. I strongly believe that all Australians should be afforded the protection of warranted surveillance rather than warrantless surveillance and that, if it is not accepted, that at the very least these professional classes of people and those who they serve should be protected.

The court held that those principles could not be construed so that merely the authorisation of an interception was a violation of the principle of legal professional privilege. So, a fortiori, Senator Ludlam, if an interception under the T(IA) Act has been held by the court not to violate the principles of legal professional privilege, then how can access to metadata—merely details of the communication, which specifically prohibits access to the content—be regarded as doing so?

That is what they do. And, as I also pointed out to Senator Leyonhjelm, these are exclusionary rules. So even if, in the inconceivable circumstance that access to metadata somehow, by inference, disclosed content, that could not be admissible against the interests of a party seeking to exclude it from evidence, in any event. It could not happen.

However, rest assured that the amendment that Senator Leyonhjelm propounds and that you contend for, is entirely unnecessary, because there is no set of circumstances in which the content of a communication between a lawyer and their client could be accessed under this regime.

I would like to make an observation—and it is by no means a criticism of Senator Leyonhjelm, because he has done some terrific work in relation to this, and I am grateful to him and Senator Ludlam for the work they have done. In the Law Council's submission to this bill, under the heading 'Client legal privilege and confidentiality', there are paragraphs 97 to 106, and it makes two recommendations. The submission talks about the importance of client legal privilege. It says:

It does not seem that what they are saying is suggesting that metadata retention would facilitate a breach of legal professional privilege. They are indicating some 'nervousness'—for want of a better word—about whether it is appropriate to have that information about whether a lawyer has been contacted, the identity and location of a lawyer, or the identity and location of witnesses. It is not actually about the content of the communication, which cannot be disclosed; it is about related matters. I assume that that is what Senator Leyonhjelm's concerns are about. It is not about the content of the communications. I just want to put that in context, because it seems that the Law Council is not saying that this will breach legal professional privilege, but it is saying that it will lead to the identification of whether legal advice has been sought and the identity of witnesses. I am expressing my nuanced concerns on this. What protection will there be of the identification and location of witnesses and the lawyer, and the number of communications between the lawyer and the client or witnesses and the duration of these communications—in what circumstances would that be used in the context of this data retention bill?

Let me just make the fundamental point that that is what this bill is about. This bill is about criminal investigation of serious crime: terrorism, paedophilia, transnational and organised crime. That is what the bill is about. As I said in a radio interview last week, I do not know any journalists who are terrorists or paedophiles or transnational organised criminals, and I am pleased to say I do not know any lawyers who are either. As you rightly say, there is a crime-fraud exception to the rules of legal professional privilege and, as you rightly say, the Law Council does not appear to be saying that the bill violates those criminals. Because of the reasons I have explained, you have understood this, Senator Xenophon. They do not.
                                                                                     </p>

The duration of that communication could also be disclosed, but those things are not—for all the reasons I have explained more than once now—within the ambit of the protected confidential relationship between the lawyer and the client.

I recognise that content comprises that element of legal professional privilege and it would not be retained. What I said was: law societies have pointed out that retained metadata could allow inferences that undermine legal professional privilege to be drawn, arising from whether a given lawyer has been contacted, the identity and location of clients and witnesses, the number and types of communications and so on.

The point about it is that it is not only journalists' sources that need to be protected. There are undoubtedly instances where clients contacting lawyers without the content of that communication being revealed could undermine legal professional privilege.
