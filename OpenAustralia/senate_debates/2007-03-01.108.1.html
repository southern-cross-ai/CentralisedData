        I would like to take this opportunity to wish Senator Heffernan a happy birthday for this weekend. My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Senator Scullion. Will the minister inform senators of government initiatives and programs that mentor or assist disadvantaged or at-risk youth in the community?

         I would like to thank the senator for his question and I would like to not only acknowledge his longstanding interest in disadvantaged youth in his own community but also acknowledge and thank him for the advice that he has provided me with on that matter. This government absolutely believes that all young Australians deserve the opportunity to fully participate in our community.

          Thank you! Unfortunately, not all young people have the skills and the confidence to be able to participate in our community. The issue associated with that should be well known to all those here who are parents or who are associated with youth in any way: the issue of disconnection. If you are disconnected from your community or you are disconnected from your family—

           I am sad that those on the other side see this as such a low-priority issue that they interject on this matter. But it is certainly an extremely important matter to those on this side.

           Last Saturday I was very pleased to launch a new program that will assist young people at risk in the Illawarra region of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           . While I am on my feet I would certainly like to acknowledge the work of Senator Fierravanti-Wells, who will be providing a number of youth forums next month in Wollongong which officials from my department will be attending. I am looking forward to hearing your advice on those matters, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. The program is a partnership between

            St George Illawarra Dragons
           </a>
           Rugby League football club and a number of youth services providers in the Illawarra. I would like to take this opportunity to thank those providers. They are: Southern Youth and Family Services,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YWCA" rel="nofollow">
            YWCA
           </a>
           Shoalhaven and Central Illawarra Youth Services.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dragons" rel="nofollow">
            The Dragons
           </a>
           are going to work with the youth services providers to ensure they attract kids to these programs. This is all about providing a range of activities that are aimed at building the skills and particularly the self-esteem that we all know will assist these young people in reconnecting with both family and the community.
          </p>
          <p>
           This very positive program will also affect young women. We often think of football clubs as representing the blokier end of town, but this will also involve young women through the support of the YWCA Shoalhaven. Very usefully, the YWCA Shoalhaven is providing the basis for the harm reduction in alcohol use program for the football clubs, in that very blokey environment. So they are not only providing the training; they are also ensuring that eight of the players from St George Illawarra Dragons, plus staff, are getting training in appropriate alcohol use. They are going throughout the Group 7 League in the Shoalhaven area. This is a great program. It links a substantial community service organisation with service providers and communities—and what a partner to select. St George Illawarra Dragons are a fantastic community organisation. I have to commend them very much for their participation.

             The noise on the other side reflects their very low level of interest in this very important program. We do not just take these ideas out of the air; we consult widely. This idea and others have come and they have certainly been validated by the questions of the youth roundtable. The group has been here this week and they have been providing the government and me with a great deal of advice on how we should couch these programs directed at assisting youth at risk in our communities. I think that it is a fantastic program. I congratulate all those involved in it and I commend the program to the Senate.
