          COAG
         </a>
         health package has provided significant money to provide health and hospitals support. That is perhaps the difficulty that Senator Payne has in asking this question about a package that is designed as a stimulus to the economy and what we are doing as a package in the health area, which is unrelated. Providing that support is what we are going to do and we are doing. As a result of last November’s historic COAG meeting, the Commonwealth government, in implementing lasting reform to improve the Australian healthcare system, agreed to provide $64.4 billion over five years. That is the appropriate place for the provision of funding, through the COAG process, to assist hospitals right across Australia. That package includes several national partnerships to strengthen our hospitals and health—

          , I raise a point of order in relation to relevance—indeed, direct relevance. The question was specifically about the stimulus package and how that assists the ailing health sector in this country. Senator Ludwig at another time might tell us about

           , I rise on the point of order. It is obvious that this point of order has to be ruled out of order, but the persistence of Senator Abetz in this matter, given his performance as minister, is breathtaking. What Senator Ludwig was making clear was the government’s initiatives in the health area providing funding through a different vehicle. It was a perfectly appropriate and honest response. So I do not know that there is any point of order. It just seems that Senator Abetz insists on wasting the time of the parliament by taking these points of order to pursue some cause he holds dear about relevance—one that he showed no interest in when he was a minister.

             If you want to confuse what we are doing in the health area and what we are doing with the Nation Building and Jobs Plan legislative package, I can make it even plainer: the legislation that needs to pass, which you are holding up, will provide a tax bonus for working Australians.

I think it is fair to say that there are still 46 seconds out of 60 to go and that to take a point of order this early is not allowing the minister to get close to answering the question. If those opposite keep taking points of order, all they are doing is wasting their own time. There are still 46 seconds to go, and Senator Ludwig is entitled to complete his answer.
