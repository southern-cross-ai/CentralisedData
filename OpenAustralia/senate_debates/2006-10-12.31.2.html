       <p>
        I do not want to speak for long in this first part of the committee stage. Suffice it to say and to repeat for the third time that I also was concerned at the constrained nature of the committee hearing. It was not a very exhaustive thing. The Labor Party—through Senator Conroy—had 10 minutes to question witnesses. Government senators had about 30 seconds or, if we were lucky, we got 90 seconds. That is because there were so many of us there wanting to make a contribution to this debate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very impressed, as always, with Senator Murray’s comments yesterday. A lot of what he says is true. Hopefully his warnings will never come to pass, but it is something that we as senators need to carefully look at.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think, now that the government does control the Senate, government senators have to be much more stringent in their scrutiny of some bills, not with the purpose of trying to interfere with the government’s program, which I support, but just to make sure that the bills which come through are drawn in a way that will achieve the government’s goals. I am concerned about a number of the pieces of this legislation. Most of it we all support, I think. There are some elements that I am concerned about. I have negotiated with the minister and with the minister’s office. I am relatively satisfied with most of the amendments that are coming forward, although I do want to question the minister on some of these as we go.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am concerned at some of the amendments coming through that could lead to country radio stations shutting down. I was distressed to see in today’s
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        , and perhaps in other papers as well, the comments by Macquarie Regional Radioworks that certain stations might have to shut down because they will simply not be profitable. One of them referred to is in Mareeba. It is a radio station I well know because it is up where I come from. I am very often in Mareeba. I use that radio station. If, as a result of what we do today, that radio station and the Roma radio station, which is the other one mentioned—and Senator Joyce would be concerned if the Roma radio station shut down—ceased operation, that would mean a lesser voice for country people with commercial radio stations. Whilst the Mareeba and Roma stations might not be perfect at the moment, they are certainly much better than nothing.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the figures mentioned in this article are correct—and I have taken some time to check them out—and those radio stations continue to lose money then any sensible employer, any sensible owner, will shut them down. Why would you keep a radio station going if you are losing money on it? If the impositions we make in this bill are such that two radio stations in Queensland that I know of are going to shut down then I think that is bad legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        We can try to impose conditions on country radio stations to make sure they do feature country interest stories but, if in doing that we shut the station down, how are we advanced? We have gone backwards. That particularly concerns me. I again, as my colleague Senator Brandis did, refer to yesterday’s
        <i>
         Financial Review
        </i>
        editorial and urge my colleagues to understand that you can overregulate country radio stations and you can, by overregulating them, get the reverse effect to what you are trying to achieve—that is, you will have less understanding in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_George_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
         Senator George Campbell
        </a>
        made some comments about me yesterday that I do not want to go into. Suffice it to say that Senator George Campbell, from his ivory tower in Sydney, would not really understand much about country radio. But he should understand that the ABC in country Australia is a very viable and very local organisation. Country commercial radio stations know that. They have real competition in country areas. You can turn off the commercial radio station and go to the ABC, because the ABC is very local and runs good programs. That is why the commercial radio stations have to continue looking at what their audience wants. If their audience wants local news, they will run local news because they want the listeners. They want the listeners because they want the advertisers, and the advertisers will only advertise if they know they have listeners.
       </p>
       <p>
        I ask the minister to consider whether we should perhaps not be regulating regional commercial radio as much as is proposed, although my negotiations with the minister have achieved some things but not all I would have hoped—but I guess a little bit is better than nothing. But perhaps we would have been better looking at this in another way. Perhaps we would have been better saying, ‘Let’s take the shackles off community radio and leave commercial radio in the country regulated only by their audience.’
       </p>
       <p>
        I know there are a lot of community radio stations in many, many towns in country Queensland—I am sure there are in other parts of Australia, but as a Queensland senator I want to talk about Queensland—but they are constricted in the amount of money they can earn. They cannot sell advertising. They can sell sponsorships in a very limited sort of way. There are one or two community radio stations that I am personally familiar with who do a great job. They do employ journalists, but they struggle to make ends meet. What if we were to remove the limitation of five minutes of advertising per hour on community radio—five minutes which, if you do not use them in that hour, you cannot save up for the next hour? We could perhaps look at that sort of thing. I am not sure, but the minister might be able to indicate to me whether that is relevant in this whole package of legislation. Or perhaps the minister is considering these matters in some other forum or some other set of legislative packages.
       </p>
       <p>
        One way to address this which perhaps we could have explored a bit more was to leave commercial radio as it is—relatively unregulated, particularly in country areas—and unleash community radio, which puts another competitive element in the country market. I do not think community radio will ever directly compete with commercial radio, but it is something that is worth thinking about. I think we would have been better looking at that than imposing regulations on commercial radio in country areas that can lead to some of them shutting down, as today’s papers have said.
       </p>
       <p>
        By and large, I am satisfied that the bill is appropriate. I am delighted that the minister took on a lot of the suggestions made by the committee—that is, by Senator Eggleston, Senator Brandis, Senator Ronaldson and me. The minister has taken up the recommendation on the two out of three rule for country Australia but which the Liberal Treasurer, Mr Costello, has, by his influence, extended right across the spectrum. That is a good win for the Liberal Party, and I appreciate that—it does ensure diversity of voice.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am delighted that the minister has addressed the B-channel access. It is something that I questioned a lot of witnesses about at some length in the committee hearings. I know Senator Conroy also raised some questions on the B channel. I am delighted that the minister has taken on my thoughts on that, which are displayed in the committee report, although I do want to question the minister about that, because there are a couple of elements that I think need a bit of scrutiny, perhaps a bit of tweaking. I am delighted the minister took up Senator Brandis’s point on the powers of the

          All senators contributing had something to do with it. You were there, Senator Conroy. I do not need to explain to you what happened in the committee hearings. You and I sat through every single minute of those hearings. There were some senators who wandered in and out at various times. You would have to acknowledge that Senator Brandis led the debate and in fact wrote the report on that matter. You would have to acknowledge that I led the debate on the B channel and supported that. You would have to acknowledge that all senators, I think, were supportive of the two out of three rule.

              Well, we will see. You need a bit of practical realism in all of this, Senator Conroy. You have an opportunity to make this work. You know it is going to go through. You have an opportunity, as I had, to speak to the minister and say, ‘This will not work; this is silly. Why don’t you try this?’ That is what I think we are here for—to try and understand the realities.

              Senator Murray made the point that we put a lot of faith in the minister. Yes, Senator Murray, we do. I am afraid that is how it has got to be. This communications package is one that our government has been to several elections on. It has been known in the broad for a long, long time. You do have to put a lot of faith in the minister, and I do. We do need to look at the things that we know are going to happen and try and make them happen in the right way. That is my role here today and that is what I want to do. I direct those questions to the minister for her to answer at an appropriate time.

               I would like to say that I support these amendments. I can assure you that, without these amendments for local content, the bill would not have got this far. I want to put that clearly on the record. These amendments protect local content for regional areas. The National Party is emphatic about that. There are obviously other senators who have the same concerns, and we are glad that they do. It is the right of senators to be part of the process. Obviously, when you have few numbers, you have to be in many places at once, but you endeavour as best you can to do your job.
              </p>
              <p>
               These amendments protect local journalism in country areas. If you do not have a local journalist, you are hardly going to have local content. The amendments are a vital part of this package. I believe strongly that there are other issues that need to be added to this package. I still have serious concerns about sections of this legislation, which will be expressed in the way I vote. Without the local content measures, certainly there would be no support for this bill from the National Party. Therefore, we are strongly in support of this bill.

               <p>
                I will make some very brief comments in response to this whole issue of getting the balance right between requirements for local content and the financial and other pressures on existing licensees. The first point I would make is that certainly these provisions are not intended to be onerous, but they very clearly are designed in such a way as to ensure that people who live in rural and regional areas do continue to get local content, irrespective of what other mergers or movements in licence holders may occur as a result of these amendments.
               </p>
               <p>
                As amended, the bill will provide for local content requirements for all regional radio licensees from 1 January 2008. Any radio licensees subject to a trigger event—that is, a merger or sale or transfer of a licence, which can only occur after the new diversity laws come into effect on proclamation—will also be required to provide minimum levels of local news and information of 12½ minutes a day and five bulletins a week as well as weather reports, community service announcements and emergency warnings, where necessary. This will form part of the 4.5 hours. They will also be required to establish local content plans and to maintain a local presence so that you do not have a situation of excessive hubbing. I am not making any allegations here; I am simply saying that it is noted that there is a potential for hubbing that removes the local presence from those who otherwise would wish to have some local news.
               </p>

                But the government recognises—and I want to make this point very clearly, particularly for those radio licensees who might be listening to this debate—that a requirement for 4½ hours a day of local content may not be the appropriate level for licensees to maintain commercial viability. During the Senate committee hearings it was found that many current local radio licensees already do provide a significant level of local content anyway—quite logically because it is part of their business; it is not hard to understand. But, in my view, there is no point at all in legislating local content levels if licensees go out of business in trying to meet them. So we are going to try to get this balance right and to give licensees an opportunity to talk to the regulator about the potential impact on their business models so that we will have some objective evidence and data about what target we should be trying to meet.
               </p>
               <p>
                The government also acknowledges that regional Australia is extremely diverse, ranging from large and rapidly growing centres like the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
                 Gold Coast
                </a>
                to small towns struggling to deal with drought and population shifts, which is probably the main concern of those communities. Accordingly, the amended bill requires the government to cause a review to be conducted on this issue. I will be directing the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
                 ACMA
                </a>
                to look at local content across regional radio and to advise whether the 5½-hour level is appropriate. In particular, we will be seeking advice on whether different levels should apply to smaller operators and, of course, whether smaller and larger markets should have some different treatment.
               </p>
               <p>
                Once the ACMA has reported to the government, by 30 June next year, the legislation will contain an opportunity for me to revise the requirement, though it will be subject to a disallowable instrument. It will be open, accountable and transparent and parliament will have another opportunity to look at this issue. I will also ask the ACMA as part of this review to advise on whether small or family owned licensees could be unintentionally caught by the provisions of the trigger event such that they may become subject to news and information requirements and local presence requirements without undergoing a sale or a substantial transfer of control of their licence.
               </p>
               <p>
                I hope that I have covered the gamut there, from those concerned that these are too onerous down to those concerned that they are not stringent enough. I want to make it very clear that there is currently no requirement at all and will not be until there is a review. We will be able to conduct a review before the commencement of any of these obligations. The more particular obligations, of course, will not happen unless there is a trigger event to do with a sale, a merger or a substantial transfer of control.

                <p>
                 I want to indicate at the outset that the Democrats will be supporting the government amendments that are listed on the running sheet. The reason we are doing that is that we think they strengthen the legislation. In saying that we will be supporting those amendments, I want to acknowledge our party’s appreciation for the work of Liberal and National party senators, and some Liberal and National party members, in ensuring that the government adjusts its package to recognise real issues of concern with the legislation that was before us.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In an earlier remark, Senator Ian Macdonald made a true point which is well understood by parliamentarians but probably not as well understood elsewhere. That was that parliamentarians are obliged, including those in my own party, to put a great deal of faith and trust in the portfolio holder, because you simply cannot get across every issue with the welter of issues that are before us. But it is incumbent on all parliamentarians to not take that to an extreme and to be alert to issues of national public interest or significance which need attention. Now that the government does have the numbers in the Senate, a number of Liberal and National senators and members have stepped up to the plate in being a little more assertive, whereas formerly they could rely on the opposition or the crossbench to do that job for them, knowing where those parties stood on matters of principle.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In finding their feet in that regard, there have been allegations of disloyalty and disunity, whereas in fact leading proponents of this assertiveness, such as Senator Joyce, are merely indicating that that is the proper role in an environment where otherwise the executive would hold sway—because, as we know, even if there are members of the cabinet who disagree with particular matters, once the majority are concluded that that is how it will be those ministers have to fall in line. That does not apply to parliamentarians not in the cabinet; they do not have to fall in line; and in this bill they have not fallen in line. Therefore the amendments by the government would not have happened without the active engagement of Liberal and National senators, and those of us who are not government senators would have been left in the situation where we simply put amendments and lose on a mass vote without proper consideration of what we put before the parliament.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With respect to Liberal and National senators, I would say that sometimes they should have a closer look at some of the amendments from the crossbenchers that they are throwing out automatically, because sometimes they do have merit. Over the last nine or 10 years, many amendments forced upon the government have, in retrospect, been found to be perfectly acceptable, have actually worked rather well and people have been pleased that they have come about. All wisdom does not reside in me or in my party and neither does it reside in anyone else or any other party, so I think what we are seeing here is a development in maturity, frankly, in the way the Senate operates in a situation where the government has the numbers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Having made those broad remarks in appreciation of the role of those who in many respects had great courage, frankly, in standing up on these matters, given the view of some of their colleagues that you have to be loyal and united regardless of the issue, I will indicate our broad support throughout for the government amendments, which improve this package.

                 <p>
                  I have listened to Senator Murray. Senator Murray is someone that I have a great deal of respect for, but he seems to have forgotten that the majority of the Liberal members actually put forward some quite substantial amendments to this bill. This notion that we are some sort of policy lackey, just blindly following what the executive says, is, quite frankly, patent nonsense. It is absolute, patent nonsense.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I want to deal with a couple of other matters. There have been some very unfortunate reflections on other people in this chamber over the last 24 hours—particularly, I have to say, in relation to
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
                   Senator Fielding
                  </a>
                  . This is one person with a staff of three. I do not agree with everything that Senator Fielding has said since he has been here, but I will tell you what I do respect him for: the fact that he puts an enormous amount of work into coming to a position on the matters that go before this chamber.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is all right for Senator Conroy to giggle over there. He has the resources of the union movement and the Labor Party. He has resources everywhere. But somehow it is a joke when someone says that Senator Fielding is doing it hard. He is putting an enormous amount of work in with a very limited number of staff. I defy anyone to stand up here and accuse Senator Fielding of not giving due consideration to the matters that have come before this chamber in the last 14 months. I think that is a disgraceful allegation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What amuses me even more is this. There was a reflection on Senator Fielding—the person with three staff and no other resources—for not being at the committee hearings. Senator Fielding was attacked by Senator Brown, the ‘Where’s Wally?’ of the Senate, who has the resources, who does have the backing and who did not bother coming to the committee hearings. He did not bother coming to this committee. And where was Wally during the Telstra committee inquiry? You know where he was, Senator Conroy; he was wandering around—

                    I also raise a point of order, Madam Chairman. It is to do with relevance. I am not sure what ‘Where’s Wally?’ has to do with the debate in question.

                    <p>
                     On the point of order, Madam Chairman: Senator Ronaldson is responding to other senators who have already spoken in this debate so far. You will recall that Senator Brown, in his typical fashion, spent some time accusing
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
                      Senator Fielding
                     </a>
                     and
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_First" rel="nofollow">

                     </a>
                     . Obviously Senator Ronaldson is just responding to that. I did not see Senator Conroy make the point when Senator Brown was doing that. He did not suggest that that was beyond the call of the debate. And there was another senator who attacked Senator Fielding. I think it is important that Senator Ronaldson be allowed to continue along this line.

                         On the point of order, Senator Ronaldson, I am sure that you are aware of the standing orders and the need to reflect properly on members of this chamber. I just remind you of that. I also remind the chamber that we have not actually moved the first set of amendments yet, so we might want to give some consideration to the time constraints the chamber is under in considering this bill.

                          Thank you, Madam Chairman. As always, I respect your advice in relation to these matters. Senator Brown did not come into those Telstra committee inquiry hearings. He did not come into those. Yet he viciously attacks people who disagree with his views. It is a bit rich. I am not filibustering; I am responding. I am just about to talk about some other matters. If you talk about a filibuster, what about Senator Ludwig this morning? Twenty minutes! What did Senator Ludwig talk about, Senator Conroy? I think I heard some mention about some environment bills.

They are now debating comments that were made in a previous debate and that are not relevant to this bill. Senator Ludwig was speaking on the guillotine. Senator Brown was speaking on the guillotine. Madam Chairman, I ask you to bring Senator Ronaldson back and not let him flout your previous advice. I ask you to bring him back to the bill.

                              I said before that I respected Senator Murray. I respect his integrity and I respect his intellect. Clearly what Senator Murray was trying to elicit from witnesses during the two days was some evidence to substantiate his claim about some change in the nature of our democracy if these bills were to pass—that somehow democracy as we know it will suddenly tumble down in front of us.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Senator Murray was consistent—I will give him his dues—because he raised these matters from the

                              right through the rest of the two days. Senator Murray does not give credit lightly, and I respect him for that. When he gives credit to someone, you must take due notice of it. We had Mr Anthony Bell, the

                              supports the proposed reforms on cross-media ownership. There appears to be little realistic substance behind arguments to retain the status quo and, in many cases, these arguments are based on self-interest and fear of competition rather than what is appropriate for the community.

                             <p>
                              and I would ask you to reflect on the comments I made before about Senator Murray’s comment that people should not be taken lightly—
                             </p>

                              we are well served as a committee by having people with your long experience and, I would guess, expertise talking to us. With that long perspective in mind, I want you to give me your broad response to this legislation. We legislators are primarily concerned with this legislation from two perspectives in my view. One is with respect to consumers and the other one is with respect to our democracy. My question is: do you consider this package as a whole to actually assist the health, improve the health or support the health of our democracy?

                             </p>
                             <p class="italic">

                              In those two days of inquiry Senator Murray did not acknowledge, from my recollection—and I know he will correct me if I am wrong—the expertise of any other witness.

Mr Bell gave Senator Murray an answer that he did not want. In finishing, I will quote Senator Murray: ‘All wisdom does not reside in me nor in anyone else in this chamber.’ I think they were the rough words. That is absolutely right. For

                                   I want to deal with an issue that Senator Ian Macdonald raised in his earlier contribution—the very important role of community radio. Of course community radio deserves a hearing and an audience, because it is a major contributor to diversity, which has been a very significant part of the debate that we have had in relation to this whole media package, both in metropolitan and regional areas. I am very glad that Senator Macdonald has seen fit to raise the issue on behalf of constituents in community radio.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   There are over 160 regional community radio stations, and large amounts of local content are on community radio. It might be called more of a micro audience, but it is certainly very important to those who have the benefit of listening to local radio. It is characterised also by a very large number of local volunteers. It is, if you like, glue in a community if they have a community radio, because of the volunteers and the local content. It does provide a very important role in keeping those in communities—certainly small communities—in touch. It is extremely important to Indigenous communities. Often community radio can be the only source of broadcasting, in effect, that they get of messages that can be very important, such as extreme weather warnings and things of that nature.

                                   It is not included in the voice count because of its particular characteristics. For that matter, nor is community television included in the voice count. That is not because it does not provide diversity but because, due to its particular structure and characteristics, it is certainly not thought appropriate to also be counting it as some additional voice. Community television and community radio fall out of the voice count, as does ABC radio. Metropolitan communities are served by up to five ABC stations, with

                                   and ABC television. Community radio is also outside the voices count, as is pay television and certainly all of those new platforms, such as the internet.

                                  <p>
                                   There is no doubting the importance of community radio or the government’s commitment to it. The government does provide significant funding that the community sector leverages into large amounts of local content. I know that because it recently had a survey which I launched, and that was a very interesting indicator of both its audience reach and why it is so popular with local content, which also includes local music and entertainment. So it is a very valued resource within the community.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   I look forward to working with the sector in its transition—both radio and TV—to the new digital platforms. It will be quite a challenge for very small analog community radios to make that kind of shift and, no doubt, it will take some time. Radio does pose particular issues in the move to digital, but community television does deserve to be brought along in how we are thinking about the new digital space. I expect to have something more to say about the Digital Action Plan and how community television will be accommodated within the scheme to get us to switch off the analog signal and free up all that spectrum so that we will be in a position to use the spectrum more effectively and to make sure that community TV is accommodated.

                                  <p>
                                   Senator Macdonald made an interesting suggestion about whether or not community radio and the community sector should have so many restrictions on their advertising content. As Senator Macdonald would appreciate, that does pose some interesting issues in relation to how effectively that might then act as a competition lever for existing commercial radio and television. There is a moratorium on new commercial radio licences on the broadcasting services band as part of the move to digital. There are some particular pressures on the community TV sector and the community radio sector that I will be very interested to deal with and to look at. I certainly welcome Senator Macdonald’s contribution and suggestions in this regard. We will take that matter forward, but not as part of these bills.

                                    I will just clarify something on that particular exchange. Senator Coonan, as I understand it, when we talk about a minimum of four voices in a country area and a minimum of five voices in a city area, we are really saying that that is four voices plus community radio. In most country parts of Australia there is a community radio station, so it is really at least five voices in the country.

                                    I just want to make sure that it is understood that there are four voices, plus community radio, plus the ABC and perhaps plus

                                    . I am just trying to get confirmation. There is a lot of variety particularly in the areas that I represent but also in cities where, as I understand it—as I drive into cities occasionally—there are about three or four different community radio stations. So you actually have five voices, plus the three or four community radio stations, plus five ABC stations, plus SBS. So there is a diversity of opinion and views. I just want to confirm that that is the case, because it is a very important point that we need to consider when we are talking about diversity of opinion in Australia.

                                     Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I do think it is a very important matter that really cannot be overemphasised. It is important to realise that the voices that we have talked about as part of this package are, namely, the four voices in regional areas as the minimum and the five voices in metropolitan areas. Remember, of course, this is a floor; it is not a target. It is very important to realise that it is quarantined to the regulated platforms of commercial radio, free-to-air commercial television and print newspapers in a defined licence area. That does not include, for instance, the

                                     or the

And, of course, we are about to lift the genre restrictions on both the ABC and SBS, which the Labor Party supports. All of these are additional sources of diversity but, as I remarked in my earlier contribution, it is important to note that community radio has a particular place. The government recognises that. It is not included in any of these voices. It is a significant level of additional local community input, and we recognise that and I think that that will clarify your point.

                                      Can we be serious here for one moment? If you just want to stand around and congratulate each other, please go back to your party room and do it. This is the Senate. This is the only opportunity for those senators who have not had a chance to properly consider all these amendments—because they have been dropped on us at the last minute—to get any clarification of what is in them. The opportunity to ask these questions is now. You have guillotined that time down to four hours: do not make the Senate the same farce that you acknowledge the Senate committee was.

ACMA can approve a transaction if it is satisfied that the situation would be remedied by the actions of a third party. Could the minister outline what sorts of actions are envisaged here?

                                               I will come to Senator Conroy’s specific question in a minute. This amendment amends the provisions in the bill to require

                                               to inform applicants for prior approval of its decision and enables ACMA to deal with prior approval applications in the order in which they are received.
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment" rel="nofollow">

                                               (9) in particular provides a similar requirement that ACMA must process notifications in order of receipt. I think this is a very important matter and that is why I want to speak to it. Amendments (1) and (2) provide for the addition of subparagraph (e) to 61
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ" rel="nofollow">

                                               (4), which will clarify that, where ACMA grants an approval on the basis of the anticipated actions of a third party, ACMA must make this fact known to the applicant.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Amendment (4) provides that ACMA must deal with applications for prior approval to carry out transactions that would place a person in breach of the section—that is, 61AG or 61AH—in the order in which they are received. Sections 61AG and 61AH provide for criminal and civil offences respectively if a person carries out a transaction and it results in an unacceptable media diversity situation coming into existence in relation to the licence area of a commercial radio broadcasting licence, or if an unacceptable media diversity situation already exists in relation to the licence area of a commercial radio broadcasting licence and a transaction is carried out that reduces the number of points in a licence area. It will provide greater certainty and fairness for industry and the operation of the register of controlled media.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Coming specifically to Senator Conroy’s issue, the new subsection in the bill provides that a person will not have committed an offence—I assume that is what Senator Conroy is getting at—in creating an unacceptable media diversity situation if they have received prior approval for the transaction from ACMA before the transaction takes place. This new provision is similar to the existing section 67 of the
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting" rel="nofollow">

                                               Services Act, which enables ACMA to grant prior approval for transactions that would breach the current cross-media rules or the statutory control rules. This new provision will operate alongside section 67, as consequentially amended. ACMA may approve the transaction under new subsection 61AJ(4) if it is satisfied that the transaction would place the person in breach of the new section—that is, 61AG or 61AH—and either the applicant or a third party will take action within a period of up to two years to ensure that either the unacceptable media diversity situation ceases or the number of points in the licence area is restored if there is an existing unacceptable media diversity situation.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               I will go on a little about ACMA’s powers and responsibilities, because Senator Conroy has raised an important part of the package. ACMA has specific powers and responsibilities in this process. It can seek further information from the applicant before making a decision—there is a new subsection 61AJ(3). In deciding whether to approve the transaction, ACMA must consider all relevant matters. That includes any relevant undertakings given by a third party under new section 61AS. ACMA may specify in the notice the action that the applicant is to take—that is new section 61 AJ(6). For example, ACMA may approve the transaction subject to the person divesting their interests in a specific media operation. ACMA must specify a time period for approved transactions, during which the action to prevent or alleviate the unacceptable media diversity situation must be taken. The period must be at least one month but no longer than two years.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               ACMA is able to allow an extension of time for compliance or, in other circumstances, may seek further information from the applicant before making a decision in relation to an extension request. Extensions can be for no longer than either the original period specified in the notice or one year, whichever is the shorter period. In deciding whether to grant an extension, ACMA must have regard to what the applicant has done, the endeavours they have made to comply with the notice and any difficulties the applicant has experienced in attempting to comply with the notice. However, ACMA must not have regard to any financial disadvantage that may be suffered by the applicant. For example, the fact that the price of shares has recently dropped would not be a relevant consideration in those circumstances. I think that probably covers the substance of what you have asked, Senator Conroy.

                                                Thank you for that, Minister. That was helpful. It did not quite cover the specific that I am trying to get to. You read it out; you talked about ‘remedied by the actions of a third party’. I am just trying to get an understanding of what actions a third party could take that would be considered to be a remedy. So, as an example, if someone announced that they were going to open a new newspaper in the area, would that be the sort of thing that would fall into the category of actions? And what would the other actions be that could remedy the situation?

Mr Chapman, when he appeared before us very briefly, suggested that they would use their professional judgement. I am just wondering if the legislation contains any guidance.

                                                     Thank you, Senator Conroy. What would apply is really the same position as applies now. There are some definitions in the act; it is all about control, and obviously it would vary substantially depending on how a group is defined in the act. But it really is still the same approach that currently applies under the act, which relates to control.

                                                       I am reminded that they already have a procedure and an approach that is followed in respect of section 67 applications now. Mr Chapman, I think, is quite capable of thinking around whether or not there is sufficient clarity if there needs to be anything else, but really it is still the same approach. The definitions are there.
                                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">

                                                       does this already. So it is difficult to imagine that they would not be in a position with their current procedures and approaches to be able to communicate with those wishing to engage in these transactions and to have a clear understanding of what is required under the act and the way in which ACMA will approach it.

                                                        There has been a lot of discussion—and you mentioned it earlier—about the first-mover advantage under the rules proposed by the bill, and the amendment provides that

                                                        is to deal with applications for registration in the order in which they are received. How would ACMA deal with applications to register media groups? There are a number of different forms of communication, as you are well aware. So, for example, if an application was lodged at nine o’clock on the first morning by email, another application was lodged at nine o’clock on the first morning by fax, and another application was literally shoved under the door so that when the office opened at nine o’clock it would also have been received by hand or mail at nine o’clock in the morning, how is ACMA going to determine which is the first, if they all literally arrive at the same time, at nine o’clock?

It just does not seem other than—let me put it this way—the most outlandish suggestion that, right at the very same instant, three applications over three different platforms could all be registered at exactly the same time. I think that is really clutching at straws.

                                                              Could I put it to you that it is not clutching at straws at all. Because of the way the legislation is structured, with what is called ‘first-mover advantage’, the first person in the door is advantaged. All of the organisations will know that whoever gets in first is going to have an advantage. So it is quite conceivable that three different organisations—or even two different organisations—will literally be waiting to email, fax and hand in their applications to the organisation. And let us be clear what you mean when you say ‘one person’:
                                                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">

                                                              is not one person; ACMA is an organisation.

                                                              It is entirely possible that three separate organisations could all put in their applications at the same time, because of the way you have structured the legislation. There must be some way, other than the toss of a coin, to determine which is the first when billions of dollars are at stake. You just have to look at the morning’s stock market, at what happened late yesterday and what will be happening even as we speak. There is going to be a frenzy on the stock market and there is going to be a situation where major players—when there are billions and billions of dollars at stake—are going to want to be first in the door. So there needs to be some thought given to how we are going to process the applications if they are all coming in at the same time—which is entirely possible; it is not clutching at straws at all—when billions of dollars are at stake.

I thought it was the department who gave an answer on this. It might have been

There were a lot of things happening that day, but I thought they said that they would look at them all—and there are a lot of other criteria to be looked at because there are a hell of a lot of anticompetitive instances to be looked at. Someone might perhaps look up what the department actually said because I thought an answer was given which, as I recall, sort of satisfied me at the time. Senator Conroy’s memory may be better than mine on what was said.

I would imagine that you would be in court on the definition. We have set up a process. If billions of dollars of merger activity is going to be based on literally the flip of a coin, I would imagine that News Ltd or any of the other major media players would be absolutely wanting to enforce the letter of the law. I am conscious of making sure that we have a process that will actually stand up in a court—not just because the minister says, ‘I didn’t think it was going to happen,’ and then suddenly, bang: three applications turn up in the morning.

ACMA has the power to determine a process of dealing with applications as they are received even if it is down to the last second. So, whether it is theoretical or not, I am very confident that ACMA will be able to have processes in place that will enable it to deal with the process and how these applications are received. It is certainly the intent of the amendments to give ACMA that power to be able to deal with notifications in order of receipt. It certainly already has the power to determine any process that is required in order to be able to deal with applications as they are received.

The purpose of the amendments is to amend provisions in the bill to prohibit the control of more than two out of the three regulated media platforms of print, free-to-air television and radio. This so-called two out of three rule will prevent three-way mergers.

The legislation also contains an amendment that provides that remedial directions may be issued by ACMA for the correction of an unacceptable three-way control situation.

Amendment (14) allows ACMA to accept written undertakings that the person undertaking a transaction will take specified action to ensure that an unacceptable three-way control situation does not exist in relation to the licence area of a commercial radio broadcasting licence. Amendment (19) will enable ACMA to apply to the Federal Court for an injunction to restrain a person from engaging in any conduct that would result in an unacceptable three-way control situation coming into existence in a commercial radio broadcasting licence area. Of course, there are further technical amendments.

The government think that that is an important structural additional safeguard in this package of legislation, in addition to the voices test, because it provides a limit on the types of mergers as well as the number of them. In respect of Senator Conroy’s specific question, my very clear understanding is that it certainly does not change the floor of either four voices in regional areas or five voices in metropolitan areas. It is an important provision that will prevent undue concentration and protect diversity.

When you change major legislation in this country, when you change things that have attracted as much media attention as this has, you need to assure the public of Australia that there are correct mechanisms in place. I think that is a very important thing.

I put that question to the minister concerning the media diversity rules and the powers that ACMA has to prevent these breaches.

I do agree that it is a matter of importance that those listening to the debate clearly understand that there are some very significant powers in both of the regulators to prevent breaches of media diversity rules. Those rules of course go to the heart of the cross-media changes. Those rules are that, if a company undertakes a transaction that creates an unacceptable media diversity situation,

Creating what could be termed ‘an unacceptable media diversity situation’ is a criminal offence. It is punishable by a fine of $2.2 million per day, and $11 million per day for companies. The regulator, ACMA, may also seek similar fines via civil penalties, without having to refer the matter to the

These are very important matters that have been raised, for instance, by Senator Joyce, and I feel that I am not only entitled to deal but also have a duty to deal with the issues that have been raised about what can happen if there is any particular breach. Failure to comply, as I say, involves the risk of both criminal and civil penalties. Under an injunction power to be provided by government amendment—and that was also something sought by the Senate committee, which I have agreed to—ACMA will be able to obtain an injunction requiring a company to divest, or otherwise take action, to remedy any unacceptable media diversity situation.

The ACCC will play a key role, although perhaps a reduced role now that the two out of three structural change is being introduced across all licence areas, in ensuring that potential media transactions are carefully assessed for their impact on competition in relevant markets.
                                                                           </p>

I think that is worth saying, because there is no suggestion that the existing requirements that mean that you cannot own more than one television station, one newspaper or two radio stations in a licence area will change—and neither will the existing reach limits, which are to 75 per cent of the Australian population.

The bill will require all mergers involving commercial radio, commercial television and associated newspapers within a regional radio licence area to obtain formal clearance from the ACCC prior to seeking an exemption from the cross-media restrictions from the regulator, the ACMA—the

Of course, this has now changed, so the ACCC will no longer need to have that particular power, which becomes obsolete with the two out of three change. In the circumstances, I think the ACCC’s powers have been very clearly articulated.
                                                                           </p>

The paper provides guidance on the approach the ACCC will take in determining what markets are affected by a media merger. That is a very important matter that affects the public and the public interest, and the paper provides considerable information on the type of analysis the ACCC will undertake in assessing media mergers and how it will address media specific issues. The key markets the ACCC will be focusing on are advertising, the supply of content to consumers—and that of course includes news and information—and the purchasing of content from content providers.
                                                                           </p>

In the ACCC’s view, rural and regional markets are currently highly localised and that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The ACCC notes that regional markets typically depend on a small number of media outlets for local news and information and are generally less well served by new media, such as pay television or the internet, which tend to very much address and complement national markets.
                                                                           </p>

                                                                            While new media may be available in regional areas, they may not be an appropriate substitute—and I have never claimed they were. I have simply said that they are an emerging and exponentially accelerating force in media and that certainly they will, to a large extent, attract advertisers and no doubt threaten some of that advertising revenue for local media—local newspapers in particular. So the ACCC considers that factors such as these will impinge on media mergers in rural and regional Australia.
                                                                           </p>

Now that there has been the two out of three structural change to protect diversity, while there is a reduced role for the regulators, they are still a critical part of ensuring that media mergers comply with the provisions of this bill.

I personally have no objection—and would not have any objection—whatsoever to anyone participating in the debate but, in view of the guillotine that we are under and the fact that we have 25 sets of amendments to deal with, I do hope that members on the government side will be fair and ensure as much time as possible is given to those who have amendments.

While they clearly have very defined roles, there is no doubt that there is some complementarity in the way in which they will be approaching media mergers. But the role has been very clearly delineated for both the ACCC and the ACMA.
                                                                                </p>

The ACCC will look after what is a market for media in terms of mergers. The ACCC will look after the competition side of it; the ACMA will look after the diversity side of it. Their roles are clearly delineated, and whilst there is some complementarity, they do have very important and distinguished approaches that are very important to this package. I take Senator Conroy’s point.

I am of the view that with respect to these specific issues, the ACMA deserves to be strengthened and the Foreign Investment Review Board provisions need to be strengthened. Now and again I quarrel with Senator Brandis on issues, but I must say that his concerns and the concerns of other members of the committee with respect to the injunctive powers of the ACMA were well conceived. I certainly always respect Senator Brandis’s contribution in these areas, where he is very well informed.
                                                                                  </p>

No doubt, the government will reject those and, therefore, I will not have the numbers, but they are on the record and I would urge the government, when the friendly debate is over, to look more deeply at this area and perhaps to consider whether any of the provisions I suggest or any strengthening of the injunctive rules that they are bringing in could be advanced.

Obviously one of the key issues is the voices test. I take on board that the minister has said that community radio stations have been extracted from the voices test. It would be handy if other media outlets that are really not as relevant are taken into account as to whether or not they constitute a point for determining a voice. You have to have five voices in metropolitan areas and four in regional areas, but some of these voices are such things—and they may be about to change—as racing stations and music stations. I do not believe they affect the political debate and the expression of opinion in the same way as TV stations and radio stations that have a strong content of talkback. This is about putting a greater control on that, and at least making a more serious statement about what voices are.
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                     We have in the tax act a concise related entity test. We have related entity tests or associated entity tests in this legislation, but I believe the one from the tax act would go further. If we can chase people around looking for money and looking for holes in acts, then that is the one that would have a far greater intent of being able to determine what voices are in this. I believe this amendment goes to the matter of the legislation, but it is basically improving on issues that are there. The reason why we are trying to do that is to protect the democratic process, to protect the fourth estate and to make sure that not so much media outlets—media outlets will always have a role to play—but those who have major shareholdings in media outlets do not attain, on the centralisation of the media, inordinate power that I believe they should not have.

This is an attempt at doing it. It is a shame that from the start of the debate, when we could have been dealing with these amendments, we have been filibustered. These amendments are for the strong consideration of the Senate.

I think it appropriate that I say something about them, because I do listen to and have respect for Senator Joyce’s views on a number of matters. I think it appropriate that I put on record why the government disagrees with this particular approach whilst acknowledging his genuineness and his desire to achieve an outcome here that I do not think is achieved with these particular amendments. But I do think it is appropriate that I record it very briefly.

Item (2) of Senator Joyce’s amendment removes from the count of separate media groups in a licence area any radio or television licence with less than 20 per cent comment—defined as news, current affairs, issues of public opinion and talkback—in its programming.
                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">

                                                                                      </a>

However, I believe that it is unnecessary. Section 6 of the Broadcasting Services Act currently has a definition of ‘associates’ which operates in a similar way to the definition of a ‘related entity’ that Senator Joyce proposes to add to the Broadcasting Services Act. Like the ‘related entity’ definition, the ‘associate’ definition covers relatives and business partners of a party. However, the ‘associate’ definition does go further and includes other parties who may act at the direction of or in concert with another. This enables the regulator to determine that an individual or company is in a position to control a broadcasting licence even if they do not directly own or control the licence or are not related to a person who does control the licence. This level of flexibility is necessary to ensure that the control provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act are both effective and rigorous.
                                                                                     </p>
                                                                                     <p>
                                                                                      Senator Joyce’s second proposed amendment would substantially affect the operation of the diversity protection mechanism in the bill by excluding a number of commercial broadcasting licences from the five-four test. Under the current cross-media rules, all commercial broadcasting licences are treated similarly in terms of licensing, regardless of their content. This is because, if you think about it for a minute, the level of influence of a broadcasting operation is subject to change and working out what is influence requires a subjective judgement. Senator Joyce’s proposed amendment proposes just one method of assessing influence, but of course there are others. For example, ratings also provide an indication of influence and clearly ratings like the format or content of a broadcaster can change rapidly. Also, they can be very popular. So it is very difficult to rely on something like ratings.
                                                                                     </p>

But, more seriously, assuming you could get over those difficulties, the amendment opens up opportunities to fundamentally undermine the rigour of the five-four test, in this way. A commercial broadcasting licence that is outside the five-four test is a far more valuable one than if it is within it as it can be acquired by other operators, of course, without breaching the five-four rule. The amendment would therefore create a clear incentive for the owners of radio and television licences to possibly dumb down their services so they no longer counted for the voice test, enabling them to be sold to incumbents in the same market, in clear contravention of the five-four rule.
                                                                                     </p>

Given that many Australians primarily rely on evening news as a main source of information, I think this really is an unintended outcome, although I repeat that I acknowledge the genuineness of Senator Joyce’s attempts with respect to the proposed amendment. But I think it has very significant and unacceptable risks.

This is dealing specifically with what would be assessed as a point when there is a merger in one of the regional or metropolitan markets. There has been a linkage made—and I do not presume it to be there in this amendment—that this changes everything in the broadcasting licensing section. What it really deals with is that, when you are counting up the points—which are the number of voices in the market—you will be counting only points that are relevant for that purpose, points that are relevant as putting out a predominant amount of content. 4.8 hours a day is not a lot. If you take news, current affairs, talkback and public opinion pieces, I think 4.8 hours a day is a fair indication of whether it is an effective voice or not.
                                                                                      </p>

If that is the case then you could actually reduce the media because you would have the potential to have an outlet that is predominantly music staying in the market and one that actually affects opinion being merged or taken over.

It is clear, on any objective analysis, that it is farcical to suggest that a racing station and an empire like PBL and Fairfax coming together could possibly have the same impact on the Australian community. So we will be supporting Senator Joyce’s amendments.

Of course, working out how to attribute points or to exclude certain commercial licensees from being included in the objective test really does not assist.
                                                                                         </p>

We have seen the way in which a subjective approach to media can be seriously twisted and misrepresented, and it has bedevilled other jurisdictions around the world who have tried to grapple with something like media-specific public interest tests. Having subjective tests for media influence has two significant concerns. First of all, it creates great uncertainty for an industry that obviously has to plan, invest and operate within very stringent controls anyway—and will still do so should this legislation pass—as the outcome of the test and its consequences for mergers and acquisitions would be dependent on entirely subjective factors. No-one would know when they would ever be able to move or invest. Public confidence in the objectivity and the efficiency—‘efficacy’ is probably a better word—of media diversity protections would be dependent on the subjective judgement of the regulator or perhaps the minister. I do not want to do this. I certainly do not want to be making those kinds of subjective decisions.

I am quite sure that my friend Senator Conroy would be in here two seconds after I approved any media mergers, complaining about influence and complaining about mates. Can you imagine that situation?
                                                                                         </p>

As a result, the criteria that would be used in assessing the public interest impact of a media merger would inevitably require a high degree of subjective judgement and would involve the potential for allegations of all sorts of political interference. There would be a subjective judgement by a single individual or a group of individuals, the regulator, the relevant minister, some other relevant legal framework or the judiciary.

                                                                                          </i>

The current framework actually takes the same approach and regulates entities according to licence type, not individual ratings. Therefore, all commercial television and radio licences are treated the same under the current rules.
                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                          The influence of an individual broadcaster cannot be measured directly by ratings, which certainly change over time. Some media may rate poorly but add significantly to diversity by providing audiences with the choices to access alternative viewpoints. No-one as yet, so far as I can tell, has devised a credible way of measuring the different levels of influences of newspapers, radio and television or, for example, for talk versus music formats in radio. A lot of young people really do enjoy radio, and I do not think we should be disparaging of the ways in which young people access news and talkback. I do not think the intention is to be disparaging. But I think it would be unwise and difficult to base media policy on such an uncertain and intangible quality.

The amendment proposes to oppose schedule 1 and the removal of the cross-media laws in their entirety while supporting the retention in the bill of the removal of the foreign ownership restrictions and the imposition of local content requirements. The retention of the cross-media laws would ensure that Australia’s media industry simply remains unamended and, as I have said in earlier contributions, trapped in a 20th century world where radio, free-to-air television and old-fashioned newsprint are regarded as the only sources of news, entertainment and diversity of opinion.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              For 20 years, Australia’s media companies have laboured under a very restrictive regime that actually rewards complacency and does not permit growth across platforms. We need to be very clear that the cross-media laws impose a regulatory straitjacket on the media industry, and of course that ultimately has costs for media companies and for consumers, who both expect Australia to be in the global environment for media and certainly expect media companies to be providing services they both expect and want.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              The diversity goals of the cross-media rules can be achieved. They are very important. Let me acknowledge that: the diversity rules are very important. The diversity goals can be achieved in other, less punitive and restrictive ways. This is basically what the government has proposed. The continuation of such restrictions while foreign ownership controls are removed really makes no sense. That is a very puzzling position. It would prevent any local companies from responding to the competitive threat of new entrants, because they would be paralysed in their current structure, while foreigners could simply invest in such a way that they would provide a serious competitive threat. I welcome foreign investment—don’t get me wrong about that—but I simply do not think that you can have foreign investment at the expense of local media companies.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              Imposing local content requirements—I will just specify it again, because it is a critical part of the package—on a regional radio sector that is prevented from expanding across media would also directly impact on the viability of that sector. We have to get a bit of reality into this debate. You cannot hobble a particular sector of the media so significantly with obligations and not at the same time give them some capacity to be able to attract investment, grow and take advantage of other new platforms in a way that is going to mean that ultimately consumers would not be disadvantaged. Consumers need to be advantaged by these arrangements, not disadvantaged. I believe that the set of protections that we have built into this test adequately does that.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              It is also important to say that the removal of the cross-media restrictions will allow media companies to be able to continue to meet some of the obligations that they currently have to the broader Australian community. Yesterday I referred—and it is really worth saying—to the fact that as a community we really value Australian content. We impose—at some significant expense, as I am constantly reminded by free-to-air television broadcasters—a requirement that they must provide 55 per cent Australian content. It is simply unrealistic to expect that these kinds of companies, which are commercial operations, can be expected to continue to meet those kinds of obligations and other regulatory requirements in relation to content and standards—and Australian content in particular, which is a very important thing—and not have some idea about what is needed for them to be able to properly deploy their assets.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              With the tests that have been put in—the cross-media changes, which are now very rigorous indeed, limiting the types of mergers, limiting the number of mergers and ensuring that there is local content—we just have to stop being timid about this or we will never move from a 20-year-old law made at a time when none of these other platforms and technological changes had been heard of or even thought of. The rules might have been appropriate for another era; they are certainly not appropriate for the 21st century in circumstances where we are also moving into the digital space and, in order to meet the needs of consumers, companies are going to need to be able to continue to grow and invest.

This amendment gives the capacity to move away from a completely ‘written in the sand’ type of restriction to something that deals with greater powers for those who can have more latitude in making their decision.

The fundamental fear that must be dealt with is: what if we get this wrong? What that means is this: if, after passage of this legislation, we find that there is an overcentralisation of the Australian media market which affects our democratic process, there are no powers in this parliament to bring about a divestiture. That is the crucial issue. If there is only a 20 per cent chance that that should come about, then surely we should be bringing about the powers to actually deal with that. Surely we should be able to have the capacity, like they have in the United States of America, to break up an organisation that has become too powerful and that has started to challenge the role of the government.
                                                                                              </p>

It gives that power in a great breadth so that decisions can be fleshed out and considered. An issue brought up over and over again during the inquiry was that the powers of the ACCC and ACMA are no good once the egg is scrambled. Once an inherent oligopoly or monopoly is present in the market, you cannot retract from that position.

The amendment deals with a range of things. On the misuse of market power, currently, if you want to set up a new newspaper there is the capacity for opposing newspapers to just price you out of the market on advertising to put you out of business. When we talk about the ability of entry and exit into the print media, it is just not there. Obviously there is no free entry and exit into the television or radio markets. They are regulated. The government protects them by regulation. It is not a free market. That is why we must be so considerate of this.
                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                               You have to remember that the benchmark return of the main media companies in Australia is way beyond what it is overseas. That is because of the inherent protections they have. If we were to remove all forms of regulation in television so you could open up new television licences then we probably would not require this as much. But those protections stay in place. We have to be ever more cautious of making sure that we have the regulatory mechanisms to balance up our own regulatory mechanisms, unless we are envisaging removing all regulatory mechanisms on radio and TV—and I know that that is not the case. We cannot change the Trade Practices Act in this piece of legislation, so we must insert these powers on the misuse of market power so you cannot predatory price someone out of the market.
                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                               We must put in place controls for the prohibition of acquisitions that would substantially lessen competition in market. We must have injunctions, pecuniary penalties and, most importantly, that sword of Damocles, if you have everything wrong—the ability to have divestiture powers. That is the parachute that the Australian public want—the parachute whereby, if the intent of the Senate is wrong, we have the mechanism to deal with the issue. It is vitally important, because if we do not and if we get a monopoly that comes into play in Australia, that is it, you are stuck with it. If we do not have the powers now or we are scared, for want of a better word, to take on the major media houses now in trying to scale down some of the things in this bill, then you will be absolutely terrified once they actually arrive at their position of a monopoly or oligopoly of trying to take them on.
                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                               We could have the case where the power of this parliament is secondary in our nation to some major media organisation. That is not what we want. America have the benefit of the Clayton act and the Sherman act. They have the benefit of acts to deal with the powers of corporations that challenge the role of government. In Australia we do not have them. The most effective mechanism for controlling the nation is controlling the media. When there is a revolution, they do not announce it over the internet; they take over the radio station, the paper and the television stations. You do not put a Google search out for ‘change in democracy’. Those main mastheads of media are still as powerful as they ever were. That is why it is so important that we deal with this in a cognisant way. That is why, if we are going to go through with this legislation, we must have these powers in there. Otherwise, we are loading the gun for Australia for 10 years time. I do not think that is an honourable outcome for this Senate.

I would like, first of all, to assure Senator Joyce that the government acknowledges his concerns about the need to ensure the right balance in the media ownership package. Indeed, we share those concerns. It is important that we find the balance in providing the scope for media companies to respond to emerging pressures but at the same time respond to concerns about competition, diversity and local content.

To conduct a successful merger in any market, a set of companies would need to pass the five-four, the two out of three test and the normal competition rules that provide that a merger must not result in a substantial lessening of competition. There will also, of course, be significant protections of diversity and competition in media markets.

For those reasons, we do not think the amendment is necessary.

I think Senator Joyce has made another excellent attempt to go to the nub of the problem with this legislation. Probably the only thing I would say, Senator Joyce, is that I am genuinely surprised that you did not include the public interest test as an addition, because that is the important part. It still only leaves competition, which—as we have discussed at length with Mr Samuel and amongst ourselves in the committee—is not sufficient to protect the diversity of opinion. No marketing voices can easily be identified. But I think it is a very worthy attempt to bring to bear a more rigorous examination of merger activity, particularly in this field. Therefore, I indicate that the opposition will be supporting the amendment.

That is why that is the case. In relation to the significant lessening of the competition test that has been brought up, the fact is that there is not a significant lessening of competition unless you can put up prices without affecting your demand, and I imagine that would be advertising revenue. The only time that really comes about is when there is a monopoly or almost a monopoly in the market. If that happens in the media market, we will have a major problem.

As I said, this is a magnum opus. I did not have the capacity to include and define a public interest test in it, with the time that we had available. It would really need to go a committee of all of its own, and that would need to come up with recommendations as to what a public interest test is.

It has been suggested to me that an internal corporate restructure, which does not really impact upon the effective ownership of a radio station, could be seen to be a trigger event. It has been suggested to me that the third paragraph of ‘trigger events’, which talks about controllers, could be a trigger event. I indicate to the minister that I am not going to vote against this amendment, even if the answer is not what I want, but I do think that if an internal corporate restructure does trigger the events that require these happenings to happen it really is something the government should look a bit more closely at.
                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                      I understand that time is brief, and I do not want to hold the Senate up unnecessarily, so I will ask a couple of questions at the same time, if I may. Do the requirements for local news and weather happen from now, or only upon the happening of a trigger event, meaning that if the ownership remains permanent—say, for the next 20 years—there will be no mandatory requirement for local news and weather and community announcements? I only raise this, Minister, because as you know I do have some concern at the mandating of these requirements.
                                                                                                     </p>

But I did sit through the committee hearings and questioned all of the radio station witnesses that came before us. And they represented the corporate giants, one might call them; they represented regional commercial radio; and they represented some country stations that were not in the regional grouping. Members of the committee will recall we had evidence by telephone from a representative of a family which owns one or two radio stations in country

I know this because, fortuitously, they occasionally ring me when they want a clever comment or, rather, a serious comment, one that does put the case.
                                                                                                     </p>

They will do that for number of reasons: they are good corporate citizens; they are local. But they also know that that is what their listeners want and, as I have said a number of times, what the listeners want is what the advertisers want and, if the advertisers are unhappy, then they do not pay the money and the radio station goes bust.
                                                                                                     </p>

They have particularly nominated, as I mentioned earlier, 4AM in Mareeba and the Roma radio station. I would be very distressed if anything we did in this chamber led to the

That has always been my concern. It is a concern I repeat because, even though they may not be perfect at the moment and perhaps do not have as much localism as I might like, at least they are there. If we do things that cause them to permanently lose money, they are going to shut down and we are going to have nothing. So something bad is better than nothing at all. They are the concerns I have.
                                                                                                     </p>

And, if so, is that what the government intended? And is that good policy? And, if it is not, perhaps the minister might look at it some other time. As I say, I am not going to vote against the amendment today, but I do think it needs to be aired. The other thing is: what are the time lines for the introduction of the news and weather?
                                                                                                     </p>

I am not asking the minister to commit to doing it, but could I get the minister to say that the government might have a look at the restrictions on community radio, at the appropriate time?

I will be very brief, given where we are at in the schedule. On your principal question, which related to corporate restructure: it depends, of course, on what is a trigger event, and the intention is to ensure that a trigger event is not avoided. It is all tied up with the whole notion of a change of control. So, obviously, with restructures it will always depend on the circumstances, and I could not possibly answer every combination or permutation that might come up. That is why the regulator is there.

We will, if these bills pass, be imposing a requirement, but it will be deferred until there can be a proper review to establish the right balance and proper benchmarks. That should give a level of comfort to anyone listening to this debate that we are interested in hearing about the impact of these requirements and how they might impact on a particular business case.

It is going to come back to the parliament because if this mandatory requirement is altered at all then it must be done by way of a ministerial direction, a disallowable instrument. I fully intend it to be reviewed in a transparent, accountable and very open way.
