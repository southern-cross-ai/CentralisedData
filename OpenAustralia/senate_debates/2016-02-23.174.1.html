        I speak today in memory of a great Queenslander, a hardworking colleague and a true friend. It was with great sadness that I heard this week of the passing of the Lockyer mayor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Jones
        </a>
        . Mayor Jones had served as mayor of the region since 2004 and was elected as the first mayor of the newly established
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockyer_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Lockyer Valley
        </a>
        Regional Council in 2008. Mayor Jones was an unstoppable advocate for this region. Faced with the worst natural disaster in a lifetime, Mayor Jones embodied leadership in his affable and modest style.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steve and I worked together closely following the 2011 Queensland floods, in my capacity as Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery. As many in this place will remember, the 2011 floods were a disaster that affected nearly the entire state of Queensland. Grantham, a small town in the Lockyer Valley within Mayor Jones's council area, was amongst the most devastated towns in the whole state. Out of the 38 who tragically lost their lives across the entire state as a result of this disaster, 12 of them came from this small community of around 500 people and 19 died across the Lockyer as a whole. The damage to public and private property was also immense. Houses were inundated with water, cars were washed off roads and council roads and bridges were washed away.
       </p>
       <p>
        The town was first settled in the mid-1800s and was built on a flood plain. Devastated residents were now faced with the difficult choice of rebuilding their homes in this dangerous corridor or leaving their tight-knit community behind. Unsatisfied with leaving his constituents with this dilemma, Mayor Jones embarked on a very ambitious project. He wanted to relocate the entire town. Under the scheme, a 485-hectare estate was created on higher ground, overlooking Grantham. New Grantham, as it became known, was possible due to a land swap deal that allowed residents to swap their blocks for new property in the relatively safe location. The redeveloped township of Grantham is a permanent testament to his vision and love for his community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mayor Jones was someone who would always leave politics at the door and who would always keep in touch. Getting to work with him during the reconstruction period after the 2011 floods was a real pleasure. I was very much looking forward to visiting the Lockyer in a few weeks' time with Minister Donaldson. Mayor Jones had contacted us and offered to give us a tour of the community to view the results of the recovery and see the contribution they make to the state's agricultural sector. Always the advocate for his community, Mayor Jones wanted to speak with us during the visit about opportunities for expanding agriculture across the region. Sadly for him and his family, he is no longer a strong advocate for the community, but I firmly believe that his legacy will live well into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        My thoughts and the thoughts of my family are with Mayor Jones's family, friends and the staff of the
