        </a>
        Bill 2008 (the Bill) is part of a package of bills giving effect to the Government’s 2008-09 Budget announcement to establish three new nation building Funds that will provide significant investment in transport, communications, energy, water, education, research and health infrastructure to strengthen the economy. These new Funds build Australia’s infrastructure needs for the future and will assist in addressing Australia’s immediate challenges in response to the global financial crisis, as well as its longer term challenges over the next decade and beyond.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To help shield Australians from the global financial crisis, the Government has announced it will fast track its nation-building agenda. To facilitate this acceleration, this Bill and a consequential amendments bill allow for interim arrangements to begin as early as possible, as investment in critical infrastructure can help secure economic activity in the short term and extend growth potential in the medium to long term.

        Consistent with the Government’s economic security strategy to strengthen the Australian economy in the face of the global financial crisis, the Bill permits me, as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Minister" rel="nofollow">

        , to determine a drawing rights limit for spending from the Funds covering the period up to 30 June 2009. This will enable work in key infrastructure areas to commence before 1 July 2009. To apply rigor and transparency to spending from the Funds prior to the 2009-10 financial year, the determination will be made in writing and tabled in the Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Funds will be established as ‘special accounts’ in the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From 2009-10, the Government will consider proposals as part of the Budget process. Transparency and scrutiny for payments from the 2009-10 financial year onwards is provided by the Government including a general drawing rights limit in the Appropriation Acts. The general drawing rights limit will restrict the total amount that may be paid out in a financial year to support relevant infrastructure expenditure. This is intended to provide the Parliament with a mechanism by which it may oversight the rate at which the amounts are being expended for investment in infrastructure.

         COAG REFORM FUND BILL 2008

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The COAG Reform Fund Bill establishes the COAG Reform Fund for the purpose of disbursing funds to the States and Territories. The COAG Reform Fund forms part of this Government’s modernisation of federal financial relations and complements the nation-building funds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Where the Building Australia Fund, the Health and Hospitals Fund or the Education Investment Fund is used to finance projects by the States, money will be channelled from the nation-building fund to the State or Territory via the COAG Reform Fund. The COAG Reform Fund will also be used to disburse funding provided in future budgets to the States and Territories for areas of specific reform.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Payments through the COAG Reform Fund will require a written agreement between the Commonwealth and the recipient jurisdiction, setting out the terms and conditions of the payment. These terms and conditions will include payment amounts and performance benchmarks, the achievement of which, in the case of National Partnership reward payments, will be assessed by the independent COAG Reform Council. Where the COAG Reform Fund is used to disburse grants from one of the nation-building funds, terms and conditions of financial assistance will be contained in written agreements made under the Nation-building Funds Act 2008.
       </p>
