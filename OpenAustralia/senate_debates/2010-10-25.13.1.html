        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Carr. I refer to the statement by the Western Australian Labor opposition leader,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ripper" rel="nofollow">
         Eric Ripper
        </a>
        , that state Labor opposes the proposal to house 1,500 male asylum seekers at a disused Army barrack at Northam and to the statement of the President of Northam Shire Council, Steven Pollard, that he was only made aware of the Northam centre minutes before the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bowen" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Bowen
        </a>
        , and Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
         Julia Gillard
        </a>
        , spoke to the minister and made the announcement. Does the minister believe that presiding over a rushed decision, which does not even have the support of the WA state Labor Party, is a way to fix the government’s border protection mess?

         I thank Senator Cash for her question. I am aware that media reports have contained references of the type that she has referred to in her question today. I have noticed, however, that Mr Barnett has safety concerns for Northam, which were covered in an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAP" rel="nofollow">
          AAP

         report. He said, ‘I am concerned about the security and safety of the residents of Northam.’ I am advised that Northam was suggested as a site by the Western Australian Premier. He was the one that suggested this site. He said he chose the facility because of, amongst other things, its closeness to emergency facilities in comparison with the existing immigration detention centre at Curtin. That was the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of Western Australia
         </a>
         who made this suggestion.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I like about this issue is the glorious luxury that those opposite seek to indulge in when discussing these questions. They are more than happy, in conversation, to make suggestions about the location of facilities of this type but only to make the cheap, snide remarks that we hear today—the sorts of remarks—

            The acts of hypocrisy here should know some limits. I know I am constantly disappointed on that topic, but it is one thing to go to the public and say there is a safety and security issue, having yourself suggested that this be a site for a facility. I do think that, by the standards of debate on this issue, this obviously gets there right at the top of public contribution. I think it is important to assure the local residents about the contractual arrangements between the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Immigration and Citizenship

            and its detention service provider, Serco. These require Serco to conduct its operations in such a way that everything is done to ensure that the detention population is managed—

             , I ask a supplementary question. Will the government provide an immediate guarantee to the local communities where detention centres are being placed that it will provide them with the necessary funds to ensure that they are properly resourced so that they are able to cope with the extra pressures placed on them—in particular, in the areas of security, housing and health?

              What I can assure the senator, as she well knows because of her interest in this topic—she would have heard government ministers say this over and over again—is that the government was spending $164.5 million to provide for the secure accommodation of 1,500 people at the northern training centre. The government will be working with affected communities to minimise the impacts of any new centre. The impacts will be paid for by the government.
             </p>
             <p>
              That was always the case, Senator, as you well know. All health and education costs associated with the government’s detention activities will be met by the Commonwealth, as is always the case. Services provided to asylum seekers will include education, English language lessons for adults, health services on site and recreational facilities such as for sport to ensure that people are looked after properly. These are the standard provisions that the Commonwealth ensures will be provided. You know that.

                 All of these things have a history. I might remind the senator who asked the question what Mr Ruddock drew to our attention on 9 May 2000. He said:

                <p class="italic">
                 To relieve the pressure on existing facilities the government has decided to implement a long-term strategy that will see new centres established and older facilities upgraded. This will ensure that there is sufficient appropriate accommodation for detainees in the future and that Australian staff who have care of these people have satisfactory working conditions.
