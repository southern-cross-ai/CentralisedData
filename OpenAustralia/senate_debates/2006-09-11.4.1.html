       <p>
        by leave—On 7 September in question time Senator Ray asked me a question which said in part:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Why are young Australian service men and women risking their lives in Afghanistan to protect a government that ignores poppy cultivation, which in turn has the effect of allowing heroin to be sent to Australia with the resultant loss of young Australian lives?
       </p>
       <p>
        In my response I said in part that I totally rejected the proposition that ADF personnel are protecting opium growers and drug suppliers. In saying that, I believe I was quite reasonably following the assumption behind the senator’s question and on rereading
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        I still believe that to be the case. I disagree with Senator Ray’s statement in taking note when he said, ‘My question was fairly explicit.’ I was responding to a serious question with a serious answer. I make it clear, however, that I now fully accept Senator Ray’s assurances that he did not intend his question to have the meaning it did. I also make clear that I did not intend any offence to Senator Ray and I withdraw any that was taken. However, I reiterate the point that I totally reject any connection between heroin illicitly brought into Australia and the role of the ADF in Afghanistan.
