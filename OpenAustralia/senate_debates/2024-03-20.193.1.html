       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The speech read as follows—
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill that I introduce today will enshrine an objective of superannuation in legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It defines the objective as:
        <i>
         to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This simple and straightforward objective will serve as a guide for future governments, regulators, industry, and the wider community—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Instilling greater confidence in the system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia has a world class superannuation system that is the envy of countries across the globe.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But for the last ten years super policy has been costly, confused and chaotic.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Those opposite raided the superannuation system for their own purposes with a devastating impact on the retirement savings of millions of Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Around $36 billion in savings meant to last a lifetime were drained out of super accounts in a matter of months.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Legislating an objective of super will help prevent this sort of short-sightedness ever happening again -
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Making sure the focus of super is on the best interests of members, and not on those interested in ideological battles.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The objective will help ensure super delivers on its foundational promise of providing a dignified retirement for more Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will secure super's future by embedding its purpose into law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will ensure that any future changes to the superannuation system will support its objective, not supplant it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill does this by requiring Ministers to produce a statement to Parliament explaining how any proposed changes to super are compatible with its purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Policymakers will be held to account when considering changes that affect Australians' retirement savings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The objective will not alter superannuation trustees' existing obligations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Super funds will continue to be required to make investment decisions in the best financial interests of their members.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This legislation also doesn't change the ability of members to get early access to their super on compassionate grounds or in cases of financial hardship.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For trustees, the objective will serve as a reminder of their role to support members during their working life and into retirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And with more Australians approaching retirement age than at any time in our history, delivering better retirement incomes has never been more important.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill is an important next step towards a stronger super system for a stronger economy and it has been met with strong industry support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We know that superannuation is a significant source of capital -
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It contributes to the strength of our financial markets—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And there are opportunities to leverage superannuation investment in areas of national economic priority where it aligns with the best financial interests of members.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Having a clear, legislated objective of super will help ensure these broader benefits of super can be maximised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will be a defining decade for our nation, and that demands defining the role of superannuation—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To protect the gains that have been made and pursue its greater potential.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor built super, we'll protect it and make it the best it can be to ensure it continues to deliver dignity in retirement for generations of Australians to come.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
