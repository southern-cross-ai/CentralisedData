        My question without notice is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I welcome the decision by the Prime Minister—and, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition—to meet
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Holiness" rel="nofollow">
         His Holiness
        </a>
        the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I ask the minister: will the Prime Minister be using this opportunity, and his good offices, to bring about a win-win reconciliation situation between the exiled Tibetan leadership and people and the People’s Republic of China? If the minister does not know the answer to that, I ask if he would put the recommendation to the Prime Minister that he use this opportunity to move towards a pre-Olympics reconciliation between the Tibetan people and China, which of course would be a win for China, for Tibet and for the whole world.

         It is true that the Prime Minister has announced that he will be meeting with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
          Dalai Lama
         </a>
         this week. I am sure that is something that many in this chamber would welcome. I personally am pleased, as someone who does respect the Dalai Lama and his role in the world, that he is in a position to do so. I do not know what the content of the discussions will be. I am happy to ensure that the Prime Minister is aware of your recommendation, Senator Brown, but obviously it will be a matter for the Prime Minister as to what he wishes to raise with the Dalai Lama when he meets him. This is a difficult and sensitive area, as he would well understand. I respect not only Senator Brown but also the many others who have a particular view about the situation in Tibet. Senator Brown would also understand the extraordinary importance of Australia’s relationship with China. I think the Prime Minister in particular can take great credit for establishing a very strong professional relationship with China, marked by mutual respect on the Chinese side as well as on ours, in terms of the critical importance of that relationship and the importance of China and its demand for the things that Australia is so well placed to supply. We respect and understand the Chinese position with respect to the Dalai Lama and the issue of Tibet. Nevertheless, as I say, we are obviously pleased that the Prime Minister has seen fit to meet the Dalai Lama and I will pass on your recommendations, Senator Brown.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that very positive response. I ask if the minister would also pass on the comments from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
           Dalai Lama
          </a>
          at the

           Press Club
          </a>
          an hour or so ago that Tibet is seeking autonomy, not independence, and the advantages of the Chinese economic advance while protecting the globally-recognised cultural advantages of the Tibetan people. There appears to be no threat whatsoever to the Chinese regime from the Tibetan proposals. The Prime Minister might use his good offices, as I said earlier, to make that reassurance clear to the Chinese authorities on the road to, hopefully, a pre-Olympic rapprochement.

            No, whatever views those on the other side may have of the Prime Minister, it is a fact that he is always extremely well briefed when he meets with international visitors. I am sure that, on this occasion, he will also be extremely well briefed on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
             Dalai Lama

            ’s views and his speech to the
