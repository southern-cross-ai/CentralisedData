          Senator Fawcett, thank you for that question. I am disappointed the former shadow minister for defence does not treat it with the seriousness that it deserves. It is indeed important that elected officials be extremely careful in what they say on foreign policy and security matters. That applies not just to ministers; it applies to senior members of the opposition as well. That is why consistency within either party is how we defend and promote Australia's vital interests in the region and the world.
         </p>
         <p>
          The coalition government has held the same unified and consistent position in relation to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
           South China Sea
          </a>
          for that very reason. It is the busiest commercial shipping zone in the world and it is an area through which around two-thirds of our trade passes. The government's position is consistent and clear. We ask all claimants to abide by international law, especially the arbitration ruling in the Philippines case; to resolve their disputes peacefully; to refrain from coercive behaviour; and to avoid unilateral attempts to change the facts on the ground. In particular, we work closely with the United States and with all of our Asian partners to ensure we maintain the same position and send the same messages to the world. All of us in this chamber know what is at stake. The more consistent and unified the stance, the better the chances that peace, stability and continued prosperity will endure.

             Most in the Labor Party support the government's sensible and principled stance. I note in particular the remarks of Senator Wong, when she became the shadow foreign minister, about the importance of bipartisanship. Unfortunately, the sensible position adopted by Senator Wong is not uniformly maintained by all senior members of the Labor Party. Two senior Labor members in this chamber have presented radically contrasting positions. Senator Conroy advocates a reckless show of muscle, sailing Australian naval vessels within 12 nautical miles of Chinese land features in a deliberate act of escalation. This is at a time when the whole region is trying to de-escalate the situation. Senator Dastyari takes the opposite approach. He respects China's claim to almost all of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
              South China Sea
             </a>
             , a position that is also potentially destabilising.

                Australia is joining with the whole region to convince all claimants, including China, that resolving disputes according to international law is the way to ensure that peace and prosperity in the region continue. It is important that claimants conduct themselves in ways that are consistent with international law and negotiate to settle any differences.

                By breaking ranks, Senator Dastyari undermines this collective endeavour. Whatever Senator Dastyari's motives might be, his conduct is damaging both to the credibility of the Labor Party and to our national interest. For the reasons I explained earlier in the day, Senator Dastyari must explain why it is that he has taken a different position in relation to the
