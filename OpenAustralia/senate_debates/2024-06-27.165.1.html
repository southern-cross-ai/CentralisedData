        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (the Committee) was required by section 70 of the
        <i>
         Foreign
        </i>
        <i>
         Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
        </i>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS" rel="nofollow">
         FITS
        </a>
        Act) to undertake a review into the operation, effectiveness and implications of the FITS Act within 3 years of commencement of the legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 27 March 2024, the Committee tabled its final report, 'Review of the
        <i>
         Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
        </i>
        ' (the Report).
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report" rel="nofollow">
         The Report
        </a>
        considered the administration and effectiveness of the FITS Act and made 14 recommendations, which focus on legislative reform, enforcement and oversight.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        welcomes the Committee's Report and is committed to substantial reform and overhaul of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme (the scheme).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The scheme is an important tool to support the integrity of Australia's democratic system and public confidence in our institutions. It is intended to bring to light foreign influence on Australia's political and governmental processes. It is important that there is public visibility of the nature, level and extent of foreign influence. By reducing the space in which foreign influence can be conducted covertly, the scheme can also deter corrupt, deceptive and clandestine activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to ensuring the FITS Act is fit for purpose. These significant reforms will be informed by the Committee's findings and build upon the experience of the first five years of the scheme's operation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        recommends that, given the significant flaws in the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme, substantial reform is required if it is to meet its original intent and justify the compliance burden and resources required to administer it. Mere tinkering will not be sufficient.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the scheme is to provide visibility of the nature, level and extent of foreign influence on Australia's government and political processes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that the scheme has failed to achieve its intended purpose, and that substantial legislative reform is required. The complexity of the current requirements in the FITS Act has led to a range of challenges in administering the scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2024-25 Budget, the Government has committed $71.6 million over the next 4 years to counter the growing threat of foreign interference and espionage in Australia. As part of this package, the Government has provided the Attorney-General's Department with funding of $2.1 million to undertake significant legislative reform of the FITS Act and to improve the scheme's ability to achieve its original purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends that the definition of foreign government related entity (FGRE) under section 10 of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018 be amended to:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that amendments to the definition of FGRE under section 10 of the FITS Act are necessary to ensure that the scheme reflects the different ways in which a foreign principal can exert control over an entity. Further consideration is required to determine the most appropriate form of amendments and ensure there are no unintended consequences from amendments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that the definition of foreign government related individual (FGRI) under section 10 of the
        <i>
         Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
        </i>
        be amended to:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that changes to the definition of FGRI are required to reflect the diverse ways in which a foreign government, foreign government related entity or foreign political organisation may exercise control over an individual. Further consideration is required to determine the most appropriate form of amendments and ensure there are no unintended consequences from amendments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4 : The Committee recommends that exemptions under Part 2, Division 4 of the
        <i>
         Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
        </i>
        be improved by:

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed in part.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers that changes are needed to refine the scope of the charities exemption, to meet the important goal of a more consistent application to similar activities of charities and non-charities. However, further consideration is required to ensure there are no unintended consequences from amendments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The current exemption for registered charities in section 29C exempts a person in relation to otherwise registrable activities if:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        a) the person is a registered charity under the
        <i>
         Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012
        </i>
        ; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        b) the activity is undertaken in pursuit of a charitable purpose within the meaning of Part 3 of the Charities Act 2013; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        c) the activity is not a disbursement activity; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        d) at the time the activity is undertaken, both of the following matters are either apparent to the public or disclosed to the public:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        i. the fact that the person is undertaking the activity on behalf of a foreign principal;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ii. the identity of the foreign principal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation, if implemented, would exempt any person conducting an otherwise registrable activity for a charitable purpose, regardless of whether they are a charity registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, provided the identity of the foreign principal
        <i>
         and
        </i>
        the activity undertaken are disclosed to the public.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Due to the broad definition of 'charitable purpose' in subsection 12(1) of the
        <i>
         Charities Act 2013
        </i>
        , the Committee's recommended amendment would significantly broaden the scope of this exemption, which could inadvertently lead to the FITS Act exempting charitable activities of non-charities with a political purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will further consider the registered charities exemption as part of the broader review of all exemptions (Recommendation 5).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review all current and potential exemptions under the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018, with a view to including any further amendments to exemptions that may be warranted as part of legislative changes proposed to the FITS. The Committee further recommends that any future Bill put forward to amend the FITS Act, in response to this review or otherwise, be referred to this Committee for review and report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that all current and potential exemptions under the FITS Act should be reviewed while considering broad opportunities for further reform to the FITS Act (Recommendation 1).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further, the Government will consider referring any future Bills to amend the FITS Act to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6 : The Committee recommends that the
        <i>
         Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
        </i>
        be amended in the following ways to improve compulsory registration obligations on former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Ministers" rel="nofollow">
         Cabinet Ministers
        </a>
        and recent designated position holders:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <i>
         Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
        </i>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports tailoring the FITS Act's obligations for former Cabinet Ministers and recent designated position holders to ensure that activity captured by the scheme provides a clear transparency benefit for decision-makers and the public.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports amending sections 22 and 23 of the FITS Act as recommended. These amendments would reduce compliance burden on former Cabinet Ministers and recent designated position holders who conduct speaking and writing engagements on behalf of foreign principals, such as interviews with state-owned broadcasters and talks at public universities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government generally agrees that shorter timeframes for additional obligations on former Cabinet Ministers and recent designated position holders would be appropriate. The Government will further consider the most appropriate timeframes for additional obligations to apply.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that the
        <i>
         Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
        </i>
        be amended to insert two new enforcement options into Part 5 of the Act, to enable the Secretary of the Department to:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments would provide valuable new tools to promote compliance and address non-compliance with the scheme. Introducing these graduated enforcement measures would allow enforcement action to be taken in circumstances where cooperative engagement has not been successful. This will be progressed as part of the broader legislative reforms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 8: The Committee recommends that the
        <i>
         Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
        </i>
        be amended to:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments would ensure transparency notices provide a range of information that is commensurate with ordinary registrations under the scheme, ensure adequate time to provide submissions on notices, and afford greater procedural fairness to the subjects of transparency notices.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 9: The Committee recommends that the
        <i>
         Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018
        </i>
        be amended to:
       </p>

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports these recommendations to improve the functionality of the scheme.
       </p>

        18 regarding the breadth of the definition of 'on behalf of' and respond to concerns that the current definition may extend beyond the established common law concept of agency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed amendments to sections 16, 39, 45 and 46, and Division 3 of Part 4 would clarify to registrants and notice recipients that information can only be requested for the purposes of administering the scheme, and cannot be used to gather information for other purposes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amending the definition of 'scheme information' to exclude information that is already in the public domain would provide greater flexibility with how such information is used and handled. Personal information collected from public sources for the purposes of the FITS Act would continue to be collected, use and disclosed in accordance with the

        resulting from this report coming into effect, the Australian Government establish a working group including the Attorney-General's Department, the

        On 3 August 2022, the Senate established the Select Committee on Work and Care (the Committee) to inquire into and report on the impact that combining work and care responsibilities has on the wellbeing of workers, carers, and those they care for. The Committee held hearings across multiple locations across Australia and received a significant volume of submissions and tabled documents.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 18 October 2022, the Committee tabled its Interim Report, containing 8 recommendations. On 9 March 2023, the Committee tabled its Final Report.

         The Final Report

        Overview of the Government Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government would like to thank all those who assisted in the Committee's Inquiry. We particularly acknowledge the carers and workers who shared their experiences and ideas for improving the wellbeing of workers, carers, and those they care for.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Throughout the Inquiry, the Committee received evidence and heard lived experiences about the challenges of combining work and care responsibilities. The Committee considered these impacts, as well as the interrelated challenges faced by women, culturally and linguistically diverse communities,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        peoples, people with disability, veterans, young people, and circumstances that can affect all Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government welcomes the findings of the Committee. The Government's vision is that all Australians receive high quality, person-centred care and support if they need it, delivered by workers with quality jobs, and that the systems and services that provide this care are productive and sustainable. The Government also acknowledges that fundamentally these issues are about gender equality and recognises the connections with the gender pay gap and the important contribution of unpaid care work to our community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government acknowledges the work and care challenges and impacts on certain cohorts. Women in Australia are more likely than men to work as carers. Women are more likely to use leave or access flexible work arrangements to provide unpaid care for children and other family members.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Health care and social assistance is the most common industry of employment for working age First Nations women. First Nations peoples' family obligations and kinship networks compound the extent of caring responsibilities. Government action, developed in consultation with community, must deliver for First Nations women.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee's recommendations are a valuable and timely contribution to Australia's work and care policy discussion. While the recommendation's themes are consistent with Government policy, Government needs to consider implementation, with regard for the broader budgetary implications and legislative context. As part of this process, the Government has referred all relevant findings and recommendations to the Fair Work Commission for consideration as part of the Modern Awards Review 2023-24 requested by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.

        1 A Strategic and Integrated Approach
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee investigated the ways in which workers combine working with the care of family members or friends, such as children, people with disability, medical conditions, or mental illness, as well as those frail due to age. It noted that care is a collective social responsibility. It found that a whole of government response is required to meet Australia's work and care challenges.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee found that care policies and the underpinning regulatory measures need to be reviewed and reformed holistically as a whole of government initiative. The Committee noted that there are multifaceted and interlinked issues for working carers, including the gendered nature of care, low wages, and insufficient conditions in the sector. The Committee also commented upon inadequacies within the ECEC system, the parental leave framework, the availability of flexible working arrangements, and the workplace relations framework.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends the Australian Government take a comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing the challenges of work and care in this country. The Australian Government should implement the recommendations in the committee's interim and final reports to a range of systems, including workplace relations, early childhood education and care, paid leave, disability and aged care, as well as financial supports for carers. This reform package should ensure that Australians have a right to care, alongside their right to work, and our systems and laws should provide unequivocal support for this important role through a new work and care social contract fit for the 21st century.

         Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender Equality
        </i>
        which outlines the Government's vision for gender equalityâ€”an Australia where people are safe, treated with respect, have choices, and have access to resources and equal outcomes no matter their gender. This is an important mechanism to elevate and prioritise actions over the next 10 years to drive gender equality in Australia, including addressing challenges relating to unpaid and paid work and care. This Strategy's reporting framework includes outcomes and indicators that will be used to measure change over its lifespan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To support better information, in 2023 the Government made significant legislative reforms to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency's reporting framework through the

         Workplace Gender Equality Amendment (Closing the Gender Pay Gap) Act 2023

        The committee recommends the Australian Government include a statement in the employment white paper, providing an estimate of the annual financial contribution of unpaid care to the national economy.

The committee also recommends that the wellbeing budget include specific analysis of the contribution of care to wellbeing, and include measurement of such care, its state and change over time.

       <p class="italic">
        The committee further recommends the mandatory collection of data by these companies of requests, including at store level, for roster changes and flexible working arrangements, and the percentage of changes to shifts that have been initiated by the employer within one week of the shift taking place.

        The Committee considered the experiences of both paid and unpaid carers and proposed the need for a new 'work and care social contract'. This work and care social contract would enable equalised child care responsibilities for both men and women, promote job security, provide flexible jobs and transitions in and out of work, and ensure that workers remain above the poverty line when they cannot work and when in retirement.

        In addition to legislative reforms, the Government committed at the Jobs and Skills Summit to consider where improvements can be made to modern awards, and to conduct detailed consultation and research on the impact of workplace relations settings (such as rostering arrangements) on work and care. The Government provided $0.8 million in theÂ Â Â .2023-24 Budget to the Fair Work Commission and the

        On 12 September 2023, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations wrote to the President of the Fair Work Commission to recommend the Fair Work Commission undertake a targeted review of modern awards. The letter identified key priorities for such a review, including:

        The Fair Work Commission commenced the Modern Awards Review 2023-24 (Modern Awards Review) on 15 September 2023.

        2.2 Leave entitlements and forms of work
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Five Committee recommendations relate to leave entitlement access or forms of work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Minimum leave entitlements for employees are set in law through the National Employment Standards. An award, registered agreement or contract of employment can provide for other leave entitlements, but they cannot be less beneficial than the entitlement in the National Employment Standards. Employers can also provide terms and conditions of employment above the legislated minimum standard, including greater quantum and access to paid leave for employees.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 17
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the definition of 'immediate family' in the
        <i>
         Fair Work Act 2009
        </i>
        be amended and broadened for the purposes of an employee accessing carer's leave. In addition to the current definition, the following persons should be classified as 'immediate family':
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees in part to this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Family members captured by the first 3 bullet points of this recommendation are already able to access carer's leave under the Fair Work Act. Section 12 of the Fair Work Act defines immediate family as the spouse, de facto partner, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild or sibling of the employee, or of the employee's spouse/de facto partner. Section 17 provides that this includes step relations and adoptive relations. Sections 97 and 102 of the Fair Work Act enable employees to use paid and unpaid personal/carer's leave to care for both immediate family and for a member of the employee's household.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With respect to the fourth bullet pointâ€”"any other persons significant to the employee to whom the employee provides regular care"â€”this form of relationship is not currently included in the Fair Work Act's carer's leave definitions. However, the workplace relations system enables employees and employers to agree to other arrangements tailored to the employee's caring responsibilities, including through enterprise bargaining. For instance, carers within the meaning of the
        <i>
         Carer Recognition Act 2021
        </i>
        are entitled to make requests for flexible working arrangements under s 65(1A) of the Fair Work Act.

        This recommendation is being considered by the Fair Work Commission as part of the Modern Awards Review. The Commission's work and care stream discussion paper notes this recommendation and Question 15 of the paper asks:

        Secure Jobs, Better Pay and Closing Loopholes

        The Secure Jobs, Better Pay reforms added secure work and gender equality to the modern awards objective and the object of the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Commission, as part of the Modern Awards Review, is considering how these changes to the purpose of the legislation bear upon the modern award system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Closing Loopholes reforms implemented the Government's commitment to legislating a fair, objective test to determine when a worker can be classified as casual, and the new definition will take effect from 26 August 2024. For employees who are effectively working like a permanent employee, they will have a clear and simple way to choose to change to permanent work. These reforms are in addition to other measures to address legal loopholes that undercut conditions of work, including a fair definition of employment and the establishment of the new framework for the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards for employee-like workers and in the road transport industry.

        Recommendation 26
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the principle of equal pay for equal work should be applied to gig workers, who currently do not have the same conditions and entitlements as other workers. Gig workers should have the same rights regarding predictability of work, liveable income, decent health and safety standards, and paid sick and holiday leave.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee further recommends the Australian Government remove incentives for gig platforms to avoid workplace regulations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees in part to this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is strongly committed to delivering minimum workplace standards to protect gig workers. The Government has legislated to empower the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards for employee-like workers in the gig economy. This change closes the loophole that has left these workers without access to any minimum standards at all. These changes commence on 26 August 2024, or earlier by proclamation.

        , and is committed to the implementation of equal pay for equal work across all forms of work. In this respect, the Government's Secure Jobs, Better Pay reforms added gender equality as an express object of the Fair Work Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The employee-like framework is designed to ensure that employee-like workers receive fair minimum standards that reflect the unique nature of digital platform work. It will be a matter for the independent Fair Work Commission to determine which terms and conditions will be set as minimum standards, having regard to the applications before it and the requirements set out in legislation. This includes taking into account the objects of the Fair Work Act, which include the need to promote gender equality.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This approach closes the loophole which has enabled digital labour platforms to avoid workplace regulations. It creates a new framework which will ensure minimum standards are fit-for-purpose for workers, consumers and platforms. In addition, the Government has legislated to update the sham contracting provisions (and increase penalties) and insert an objective definition of employment, to prevent misclassification of workers designed to limit access to entitlements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Employee-like workers will also be able to apply to the Fair Work Commission for dispute resolution if they consider they have been unfairly deactivated by a digital labour platform.

        The Government is strongly committed to ensuring all workers, including those in the gig economy, have equal access to decent health and safety standards. The model Work Health and Safety laws, adopted in the Commonwealth jurisdiction, extends to work performed in non-standard work arrangements, as duties relate to 'persons conducting a business or undertaking' and 'workers' (rather than 'employers' and 'employees'). The national work health and safety policy body, Safe Work Australia, monitors the implementation and effectiveness of the model laws. This includes ensuring these duties are being applied effectively in practice across modern work arrangements, such as the gig economy.

       <p class="italic">
        Five Committee recommendations relate to working hours, rostering, and the standard working week.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the National Employment Standards, an employer cannot request or require an employee to work more than 38 hours of work in a week, unless the additional hours are reasonable. In determining whether additional hours are reasonable or unreasonable, a number of factors must be taken into account, such as any risk to employee health and safety and the employee's personal circumstances, including family responsibilities. Employees also have the right to refuse to work any additional hours that are unreasonable.

         2.3.1 Employee right to disconnect
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Closing Loopholes reforms included a new employee right to disconnect in the Fair Work Act which makes clear that employees are not required to monitor, read, or respond to employer or work-related contact out of hours, unless refusing to do so is unreasonable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The right to disconnect is a high level right, with factors to help employers determine whether an employee's refusal to monitor, read or respond to contact is unreasonable. There are no obligations that limit employers or others from contacting or attempting to contact employeesâ€”just protections for employees who reasonably switch off. Employees' right to refuse employer or work-related contact (or attempted contact) out of hours will be a workplace right, so the general protections in the Fair Work Act will apply. The Fair Work Commission will be able to deal with disputes promptly, including by issuing stop orders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The right to disconnect will apply to national system employees and employers, other than small business employers and their employees, from 26 August 2024. Modern awards will include a right to disconnect term from this date. For small business employers and employees, the right to disconnect will not commence until 26 August 2025, providing additional time for these employers and employees to make arrangements that suit their workplace.

        Modern awards and enterprise agreements can include terms dealing with maximum weekly ordinary hours (which can be fewer than 38 ordinary hours per week), parameters around working additional hours such as payment of overtime, and necessary breaks between work applicable for overtime periods.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Modern awards and enterprise agreements must also include a term requiring the employer to consult employees about a change to their regular roster or ordinary hours of work. Employers must invite the employees to give their views about the impact of the change, including any impact in relation to their family or caring responsibilities.

       <p class="italic">
        On 1 April 2023, new Work Health and Safety Regulations on managing psychosocial hazards at work came into effect in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. To support implementation of the psychosocial regulations, a Code of Practice on managing psychosocial hazards in the workplace for the Commonwealth jurisdiction is being finalised. The Government has also committed $2 million over 2 years, from 2023 to 2025, to fund the development and delivery of a 'train-the-trainer' program on workplace psychosocial hazards for Health and Safety Representatives in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. The training will improve Health and Safety Representatives' psychosocial hazard literacy, and support implementation of regulations on managing psychosocial risks.

        The Government supported a legislated a right to disconnect in the Fair Work Act through the Closing Loophole reforms. These reforms also criminalise wage theft by introducing criminal offences for intentional underpayment of employees' wages and certain entitlements and increase the civil penalties for wage underpayment in certain circumstances.

        The Fair Work Commission is also required to insert a right to disconnect term into all modern awards and make written guidelines about how the right to disconnect will operate by 26 August 2024.

The importance of quality ECEC in narrowing inequality, and intergenerational inequity was recognised by the Committee, as well as its impact on gender equality and wage equity. The Committee called for a reinvigorated ECEC system to provide universally accessible, child-focused, culturally appropriate care of high quality, and be supported by a properly paid and equipped workforce. The Committee found these changes would increase access to ECEC, further benefitting children, their carers and society.

The ECEC sector is highly feminised; over 92 per cent of the workforce are women. A highly skilled and professionally recognised workforce improves outcomes for children, while affordable care ensures the benefits of quality ECEC are available to families across Australia.

        The Community Child Care Fund Open program helps services address barriers to ECEC participation. The Community Child Care Fund Establishing Child Care in Limited Supply Areas round was designed to establish new early childhood services in the most disadvantaged regional or remote communities, where there is a gap in the supply of approved services. In October 2023, the Government announced that 47 services, across 38 communities, would receive funding to establish new Centre Based Day Care services and Family Day Care premises in areas of limited supply. The Community Child Care Fund Limited Supply grant opportunity will provide a total of $16 million over 2 years, in establishment and capital support funding to successful grant recipients. Further, funding of around $84 million will be available for Community Child Care Fund Round Four fromÂ Â Â .1 July 2024 to 30 June 2026 to help support ECEC services address barriers to participation, particularly targeting disadvantaged and vulnerable families and communities, and services in regional, remote, and very remote areas.

        3.2 Subsidised care for children
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Child Care Subsidy is the primary way the Government helps families with ECEC fees. The Government introduced changes to the Child Care Subsidy from July 2023 that have reduced the cost of ECEC and made it easier for parents and working carers to participate in paid work. This is particularly the case for women, who are more likely than men to be the primary carer of children, and more likely to have the cost of ECEC factored against their earnings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From July 2023, Child Care Subsidy rates lifted to 90 per cent for families with a combined annual income of $80,000 or less and increase for eligible families with a combined annual income less than $530,000. Supporting women to increase their participation, if they choose to, by reducing ECEC costs, will boost the economy and help close the gap between women's and men's long-term economic security.

         3.2.1 Preschool Reform Agreement
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Preschool in Australia is a shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments, with state and territory governments primarily responsible for delivery. The Government's current focus for preschool under the Preschool Reform Agreement is on children in the year before fulltime school ensuring all children are receiving the full benefit of at least one year of preschool participation (for 600 hours). To see the full benefits of a quality preschool program, children need to be attending for the full 600 hoursâ€”not just be enrolled. That is why the Preschool Reform Agreement seeks to drive improvements in preschool attendance in the year before fulltime school, particularly for disadvantaged and First Nations cohorts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to the Committee's use of the term 'subsidised care', the Preschool Reform Agreement does not directly provide for subsidised care for children attending a preschool program. The Government provides a contribution to states and territories based on the number of children in the year before fulltime school ($1377.83 per child in 2023). States and territories can choose to pass this on to reduce fees for families or to improve preschool quality, in line with Preschool Reform Agreement funding follows the child requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most families who access a preschool program in an approved Centre Based Day Care setting are eligible for subsidised care through the Child Care Subsidy. The Government also provides significant funding support nationally for 3-year-olds in ECEC settings. In the 2023 December quarter, 66.6 per cent of all 3-year-olds in ECEC settings, around 200,000 children, were eligible for the Child Care Subsidy.

       <p class="italic">
        The Inclusion Support Program was reviewed in 2023, with a report released in November 2023. The report made 21 findings, identified 21 short and medium-term opportunities to strengthen the program and recommended 5 longer-term opportunities to embed inclusion in the sector. The review aimed to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the current Inclusion Support Program delivery model across the ECEC sector and explore alternative policy settings. The review considered interactions with other programs, like the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The review found that program resources are not being directed towards the activities which will have the greatest impact, such as workforce inclusion capability uplift. The current emphasis on providing Inclusion Development Fund subsidies for additional educators does not lead to increased capability, as these educators are used to supplement staffing ratios rather than embed inclusive practice.
       </p>

        </a>
        ) to both three- and four-year old children, to ensure that all children can access early childhood education and care in the two years prior to commencing school.Â Â Â .The committee further recommends that the hours of subsidised care provided for by the PRA be increased, to a minimum of 15 hours a week (600 hours a year) and a maximum of 30 hours a week (1200 hours a year), based on the needs of the child and their carers.

        The Government notes this recommendation.

       <p class="italic">
        The new preschool outcomes measure under the Preschool Reform Agreement will enable measurement of, build domestic evidence for, and understand the 'value add' of the year before fulltime school. Subject to a successful trial and implementation, data and evidence will be available to inform future policy considerations and government investment, to maximise the outcomes for children in the year before fulltime school in the Australian context. Should governments agree to utilise this data the new preschool outcomes measure has the potential to assist all levels of government to identify the effectiveness of national and state and territory-led initiatives.

       <p class="italic">
        The Committee noted that the experience of combining work and care changes across individuals, families, genders, abilities, and social groups. The Committee considered evidence addressing groups with unique work and care circumstances, including young people, First Nations communities, people with disability, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Concerns regarding the adequacy of wages, flexibility, and leave entitlements in the paid care sector were also examined by the Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee considered mechanisms for the Government to support Australians balancing work and care responsibilities. It acknowledged the Government has made significant improvements to encourage the workforce participation of women, including expanding the Government's Paid Parental Leave scheme, steps to enforce the right to request flexible working arrangements and child care support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many government policies and programs provide support for carers, workers, and those seeking employment. The Government is investing in policies and programs to provide support for these individuals. For example, in October 2023 the Government launched a Carer Inclusive Workplace Initiative, which aims to expand carer inclusivity in workplaces around Australia and enable businesses, in particular small businesses, to self-identify as committed to carer inclusivity without the time commitment and cost associated with a full accreditation process. This will help carers identify workplaces that understand the challenges carers may face in employment while balancing work and caring responsibilities and will accommodate flexibilities so that carers can maintain employment.

        that gender equality and job security are at the heart of the Fair Work Commission's decision-making. The Fair Work Commission is now properly equipped to help address pay and conditions in low-paid, feminised workforces like the care sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also provided funding to support increases to award wages for many aged care workers, as per the Fair Work Commission's interim decision of 21 February 2023. The 2023-24 Budget included $11.3 billion over 4 years to fund the Fair Work Commission's interim 15 per cent pay rise for many aged care workers from 30 June 2023, delivering on the Government's election commitments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In March 2024, the Fair Work Commission found that the work of aged care sector employees was historically undervalued because of assumptions based on gender. Based on this and other work value considerations, the Fair Work Commission awarded increases to minimum award wages of up to 28.5 per cent, inclusive of the interim increase awarded in 2023. The Fair Work Commission has not yet set a commencement date for these wage increases.

        The National Medical Workforce Strategy 2021-2031 will guide long-term collaborative medical workforce planning across Australia. It identifies achievable, practical actions to build a sustainable, highly trained medical workforce. Cultural safety is a cross cutting theme of the National Medical Workforce Strategy and is seen as important for early implementation to grow the First Nations medical workforce and provide a safe environment for First Nations peoples to give and receive care. The National Medical Workforce Strategy includes actions to improve cultural safety and the capacity of the medical workforce to create and maintain culturally safe environments for First Nations doctors, patients, and other health professionals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Better equipping First Nations organisations to implement care services is in line with the Government's commitment to Priority Reform Two of the National Agreement on Closing the Gap. This is supported by existing policies including the Closing the Gap Implementation Plan. As identified in the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, the health sector was one of the initial sectors identified for strengthening. A Health Sector Strengthening Plan was agreed-in-principle through the Joint Council on Closing the Gap in December 2021 and includes 4 streams: workforce; capital infrastructure; service provision; and governance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under Clause 55(b) of the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, the Commonwealth Government is working with the Coalition of Peaks to identify evidence-led approaches to applying a 'meaningful proportion' of funding to First Nations organisations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also recognises that First Nations registered training organisations play an important role in delivering culturally appropriate training, as well as lifting the participation of First Nations peoples in vocational education and training.

        Recommendation 13

       </ul>
       <ul>

       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees to this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports increasing the availability of capacity building programs to support the transition to community-controlled organisations, to ensure that demand can be adequately met for First Nations people to receive culturally safe, skilled and local care and support services, and that intersectional care needs are accounted for. This is complemented by the Government's Integrated Care and Commissioning Project that is trialling collaborative, place-based and innovative approaches to improve service availability across health, aged care, disability, and veterans' care sectors for people living in regional, rural and remote communities, and for First Nations peoples in targeted urban areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has announced a new Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program as part of its commitment to replace the Community Development Program. Developed in partnership with First Nations people, it will support people in remote communities to move into employment by funding meaningful jobs that communities want and will give more flexibility to communities to identify local job needs and projects, including in the care services sector. The design of the program is being informed by consultations with remote communities and stakeholders to understand how to create flexibility in a national program that takes into account local conditions and how the program can create career pathways for local people to gain experience in a real job.

        Recommendation 15
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends the Australian Government support workers and their representatives in the care sector to use the mechanisms available to them through the
        <i>
         Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Act 2022
        </i>
        to achieve wage increases. This could include care sector workers and their representatives accessing the supported bargaining stream, initiating an application for an equal remuneration order, or a work value claim.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee further recommends the Australian Government support a priority application to the Fair Work Commission (FWC) through the newly established care and community sector expert panel, for award wage increases for all care sectors including early childhood education, disability care and aged care, and all sectors covered by the relevant early childcare, and Social, Community Home Care and Disability Services Industry (SCHADS) Awards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In order to address pay equity and to stem the flow of workers out of the care sector, such a priority application should draw the FWC's attention to:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government should consider mechanisms to fund and implement, in accordance with historical practice, any wage increases and improved conditions agreed to by the FWC.

         The Australian Greens recommend the Australian Government appropriately fund any pay increases and improved classifications and conditions for care workers decided by the Fair Work Commission.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees in part to this recommendation and notes the Interim Report recommendation and Australian Greens' additional recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Fair Work Commission is responsible for setting minimum wages and conditions at an industry and occupational level through modern awards. Parties with standing can apply to the Fair Work Commission to vary the terms of a modern award at any time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noting that different modern awards apply to different care workers, parties in the identified care sectors may apply to the Fair Work Commission for wage increases and improved conditions, or the Fair Work Commission could consider these awards on its own motion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To support such applications, the Secure Jobs, Better Pay reforms established new requirements for Expert Panels in the Fair Work Commission to hear and decide pay equity claims and relevant award variation applications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In future Fair Work Commission proceedings, or in the event of future proceedings, the Government will consider the appropriateness of mechanisms to fund and implement wage increases. For example, in the 2023-24 Budget, the Government provided $11.3 billion over 4 years to fund the Fair Work Commission's interim 15 per cent pay rise for many aged care workers from 30 June 2023. Additionally, the Government has committed to providing funding towards a wage increase for ECEC workers, with details to be settled following Fair Work Commission processes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        The Government notes that the Final Report of the

        </a>
        into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of Disability also made recommendations in relation to supported employment. All levels of government have committed to working together to provide an initial response to the Disability Royal Commission in mid-2024.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2024-25 Budget, the Government also announced a new Specialised Disability Employment Program to replace the current Disability Employment Services Program from 1 July 2025. A key feature of the new program is expanding eligibility to people with disability with a work capacity of less than 8 hours per week in order to provide more diverse pathways into open employment for people with disability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new program will be complemented by establishing a Disability Employment Centre of Excellence, which will be an evidence-informed, best-practice hub that will provide resources, tools and training to help providers deliver quality employment services and supports to both participants with disability and employers. It will also play a key role in building the skills and capacity of providers of supported employmentâ€”including Australian Disability Enterprises.

       <p class="italic">
        4.3 Carers
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that balancing care responsibilities within the context of employment can make it challenging for unpaid carers to participate in employment, education and when seeking social connections. The intersections of additional experiences of marginalisation and diversity, such as culturally and linguistically diverse and First Nations peoples, can compound these challenges. These issues will be further explored through the development of a new National Carer Strategy with the goal to provide comprehensive action plans to address these challenges.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through Carer Gateway, the Government provides tailored support to carers to meet their individual needs and circumstances. This tailored support may include provision of assistance that directly contributes to supporting carers to continue in the workforce, their education, to undertake training courses, to enter/re-enter the workforce and/or upskill for employment opportunities. This support may include:

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Pensions, including Carer Payment, are generally paid at the highest legislated rate of income support in the Australian social security system. Base pensions are indexed twice a year in March and September to the higher of the increase in the

The Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index basket of goods and services is weighted to recognise that pensioners spend more of their income on essentials. Base pension rates are also benchmarked to Male Total Average Weekly Earnings. These arrangements ensure pension rates are responsive to pensioners' actual living cost increases and keep pace with community living standards as measured by wages.

Through Carers Australia, the Government funds the Young Carers Network, as well as the Young Carer Bursary Program that assists eligible carers aged 25 years and under to continue or return to study. On 26 April 2023, the Government announced additional funding of $3 million a year for the Young Carer Bursary Program, increasing the number of bursaries offered from 1,000 to around 1,600 and bursary payments from $3,000 to $3,768 each year, in recognition of the increased cost of living and challenges faced in balancing study and caring responsibilities.

These services aim to improve carer wellbeing and increase capacity to support carers to participate socially and economically, as well as reinforce resilience through preventative support services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Carers Australia, the peak body for carers in Australia, has established the Young Carers Network, which provides support, services and resources specifically for young carers. The Young Carer Network also allows young carers to connect with other young carers online.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Carers Australia also delivers the Young Carer Bursary Program, which assists eligible carers aged 25 years and younger to continue to study. On 26 April 2023, the Government announced additional funding of $3 million a year for the Young Carer Bursary Program, increasing the number of bursaries offered from 1,000 to around 1,600 and bursary payments from $3,000 to $3,768 each year, in recognition of the increased cost of living and challenges faced in balancing study and caring responsibilities.

        The Government also funds the National Workforce Centre for Child Mental Health known as Emerging Minds. In response to an increasing number of parents, carers and families accessing their resources and information, Emerging Minds has developed an online toolkit for parents, carers and families designed for use at home and/or with the support of a GP or other healthcare worker. The resources include coverage across a broad range of mental health information, parenting, trauma-informed approaches to managing impacts of COVID-19 and community trauma events, in addition to guidance on understanding supports available from practitioners.

        Supporting school-aged carers within education settings is critically important for both the building of their resilience skills and ensuring they are able to develop, achieve an education, and be positioned to progress their own future goals and wellbeing. The Government funds the national Mental Health in Education initiative, known as
        <i>
         Be You
        </i>
        , which provides evidence-based frameworks, professional learning, resources, and supports to increase mental health literacy and skills in workers and educators in early learning services and primary and secondary schools. This ensures they are able to support their students, in particular those cohorts with additional challenges potentially impacting their mental health and wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Once established, the 2 independent national mental health lived experience peak bodies will also seek to amplify the specific perspectives of mental health consumers and carers to drive equitable reform in mental health.

       <p class="italic">
        The Individual Placement and Support program is delivered in 50 headspace centres and 2 Adult Mental Health centres to help people with mental illness, including young carers, find and keep a job of their choice. The Digital Work and Study Service, provides integrated clinical and vocational work and study service providing support to young people with mental ill health, via a digital platform.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Individual Placement and Support program and the Digital Work and Study Service are currently being evaluated.

        Under the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement, all governments committed to undertake an analysis of unmet need for psychosocial supports outside of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. While carers are not the main target cohort of the unmet need analysis, it will include modelled estimates of psychosocial need among carersâ€”including those aged 25 years and underâ€”of people with mental illness. The findings of the analysis, together with the National Disability Insurance Scheme Review, will help to inform all governments' considerations on future psychosocial support arrangements for people who are not supported through the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends the Australian Government review the accessibility, availability, and flexibility of respite care with a view to improving respite care options available to working carers and those they care for.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees in principle withthis recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government funding for respite care predominantly sits in the aged care and disability sectors. Some state and territory government health departments also fund carer support and respite programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, the My Aged Care assessment teams assess My Aged Care clients and make one or more recommendations for respite services. This may include emergency respite, Commonwealth Home Support planned respite, in-home respite (through a Home Care Package), Home Care Package recipients with additional Commonwealth Home Support respite, residential respite and/or non-funded services. Subsequently, the carers and/or respite providers can then plan and book the respite services for the carer and client.

       <p class="italic">
        Carer Gateway also supports carers to access appropriate respite options to support the needs of both the carer and the care recipient. Carer Gateway facilitates the booking and funds respite services on behalf of carers, however access to, and availability of, appropriate respite services is the responsibility of the broader disability and aged care service systems.
       </p>

        The Government has established a national network of 10 Jobs and Skills Councils to provide industry with a stronger, more strategic voice in ensuring Australia's vocational education and training sector delivers stronger outcomes for learners and employers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Jobs and Skills Councils identify skills and workforce needs for their sectors, map career pathways across education sectors, develop contemporary vocational education and training products, support collaboration between industry and training providers to improve training and assessment practice and act as a source of intelligence on issues affecting their industries. Jobs and Skills Councils may also create learning resources on behalf of their industries, as a key part of an industry-led training system.

         The Australian Greens recommend the Australian Government ensure sole parents on income support payments can access the Parenting Payment Single until their youngest child turns sixteen years of age, and reverse the current policy which transfers sole parents from Parenting Payment Single to JobSeeker Principal Carer, when their youngest child turns eight years of age, and imposes mutual obligation activities on them when their youngest child turns six years of age.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation and the Australian Greens' additional recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises and acknowledges the significant contribution carers make. Carer Payment is an income support payment paid to individuals who, because of the demands of their caring role, are unable to participate in substantial paid employment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Carer Payment is paid at the highest legislated rate in the social security system and provides a safety net to assist carers with the basic cost of living. It is not a wage to compensate carers for providing care, nor is it designed to cover the full cost of caring for someone with disability or severe medical conditions. It is indexed twice a yearâ€”in March and Septemberâ€”to keep pace with changes in the cost of living.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Carer Allowance is a supplementary payment for carers who provide daily care and attention to a person who requires substantial additional care. It can be paid in addition to Carer Payment and can assist towards some of the costs a carer might incur.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has announced a range of measures in recent Budgets to provide additional financial assistance for income support recipients.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2023-24 Budget, this included providing $1.9 billion over 5 years from 2022-23 to extend the age of eligibility for Parenting Payment (Single) until a recipient's youngest child turns 14 (previously 8).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Expanding eligibility for Parenting Payment (Single) until the youngest child turns 14 ensures that principal caregivers receive higher levels of income support until their youngest child is old enough to require less ongoing supervision. By raising the age cut-off for the youngest dependent child from 8 to 14 years, an extra 86,000 single parents were receiving the higher rate of Parenting Payment (Single) as at 26 April 2024.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the same Budget, the Government also provided $4.9 billion over 5 years from 2022-23 to increase working age and student payments by $40 per fortnight and reduce the qualifying age to 55 years (down from 60 years) for the higher rate of JobSeeker Payment for single recipients who have been on payment for 9 continuous months.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also announced $2.7 billion over 5 years from 2022-23 to provide additional support to renters, by increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance by 15 per cent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 2023-24 Budget income support changes came into effect from 20 September 2023, at the same time as legislated indexation of payments such as JobSeeker Payment, Commonwealth Rent Assistance and Parenting Payment. These measures are providing responsible and targeted assistance that is benefitting around 2 million recipients.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 2024-25 Budget included an additional $2 billion over 5 years in targeted and responsible support for income support recipients including:

        The Government has committed to consider the rates of income support payments at every Budget update.

        4.4 People preparing for or seeking employment
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the value for individuals and the economy from entering or returning to the workforce. The gendered nature of work and care arrangements impact women's engagement and progression in the labour force and have implications on women's engagement with employment services. A well-designed employment services model plays an important role in improving outcomes of jobseekers, particularly women who face long-term disadvantage and complex barriers to workforce participation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 2023 Carer Wellbeing Survey shows that the number of employed carers of typical working age increased significantly in 2023, with 62.4 per cent of carers employed, 6.2 per cent unemployed and 31.3 per cent were not in the labour force. Of the carers that were employed, 36.3 per cent worked less than 20 hours per week, 28.4 per cent worked 30-34 hours per week, 35.4 per cent worked 35-44 hours per week, and only 7.5 per cent worked 45 or more hours. Some groups of carers were significantly more likely to report that their ability to engage in paid work was getting worse. This included carers aged 55 to 74, those caring more than 40 hours per week, continuous carers, primary carers, sole carers, those who care for someone who lives with them and carers of people with high to very high assistance needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2024-25 Budget, the Government announced it would introduce changes to the participation limit for Carer Payment. Under the changes, Carer Payment recipients will be able to work 100 hours over a four-week period rather than the 25 hour per week current limit. This will provide greater flexibility for Carer Payment recipients to structure their work commitments around their caring role.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Additionally, travel time, education and volunteering activities will no longer be counted in the participation limit. The measure also introduces a six-month suspension period for recipients who work over the new flexible limit, meaning if their circumstances change, they won't need to reapply to access the Carer Payment. Recipients will also be able to use single Temporary Cessation of Care days to cover one-off or occasional instances of exceeding the participation limit.

        The new voluntary pre-employment service will be available to parents and carers who are facing disadvantage and who have young children under 6 years. A broader range of parents will be eligible for the service including those in receipt of certain income support payments, as well as some parents who do not receive a payment. The service will be flexible, will value parents' and carers' roles caring for their children, and it will support them to make their own choices about the support they need. The service will be high quality and delivered by suitably qualified staff and staff with lived experience, who will support parents to work towards their education and employment goals.

        There are also a current range of pre-employment programs, employment services and incentives to help Australians, including those who have paid or unpaid caring responsibilities, build their capability and find work. These services include Workforce Australia (the mainstream employment service), Disability Employment Services (a specialist service for people with disability, with the Government announcing that it will implement a new specialist disability employment program in the 2024-25 Budget to replace the existing program by 1 July 2025 to deliver high-quality personalised services) and Transition to Work (a specialist service for disadvantaged young people). In remote Australia, the Government has announced a new Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program as part of its commitment to replace the Community Development Program. The Government funds tailored pre-employment projects which support participants to secure entry level employment through the Launch into Work program. The Local Jobs Program provides resources and funding at the local level to accelerate reskilling and upskilling of job seekers in areas that address community priorities.

       <p class="italic">
        The service will be client-centred and will focus on parents' and carers' strengths to support them to set and achieve education and employment goals. Services will collaborate with other local service providers to deliver locally engaged and place-based services. They will be able to support parents and carers to access other local services that they want and need.

        A new Individual Fund will give parents and carers discretion, transparency and equity over purchases related to building skills and capability. It may be used to pay course fees, materials or equipment required for a course, including laptops for online study.

        Alongside legislative reforms to the workplace relations system, the Government is also taking steps to support eligible workers who have caring responsibilities through paid parental leave and improved superannuation entitlements.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has expanded and improved the Paid Parental Leave scheme to support women's workforce participation and help more dads and partners take time off to be with their children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Legislative amendments that came into effect on 1 July 2023 give more families access to the Government payment, give parents increased flexibility in how they take the leave and encourage parents to share care to promote gender equality.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Then, from July 2024, the Government is delivering the largest expansion to paid parental leave since it was introduced. From 1 July 2024, 2 more weeks of payment will be added each year until the overall length of the Paid Parental Leave scheme reaches 26 weeks by July 2026 (up from current 20 weeks). More than 180,000 families are expected to benefit from the expansion of the scheme each year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government's reforms will also increase the number of weeks reserved for each parent on a 'use it or lose it' basis to 4 weeks in order to encourage greater sharing of care and household responsibilities. It will also provide more flexibility by increasing the amount of leave that parents can take at the same time, from 2 to 4 weeks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These settings, which are based on advice from the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, strike an important balance of increasing support to families, encouraging both parents to take leave, and providing flexibility in how they structure their care arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government Paid Parental Leave scheme is paid at the rate of the national minimum wage. The Government scheme is intended to complement employer-provided parental leave entitlements and extend the average length of time off work taken by parents after a birth or adoption. According to data reported by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, in 2023, 63 per cent of employers offered some form of employer-funded paid parental leave.

         4.5.2 Superannuation

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the working-life earnings gap between men and women is the main driver of the gender gap in superannuation balances at retirement and has committed to reducing the superannuation gender savings gap.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has announced that pending the passage of legislation, for babies born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025, eligible parents will receive an additional 12 per cent of paid parental leave as a contribution to their superannuation fund.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will help to reduce the gendered gaps in superannuation balances at retirement and signals that caring for babies is valued. It will also help normalise parental leave as a workplace entitlement, like annual and sick leave.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Once the Paid Parental Leave scheme is fully expanded from 1 July 2026, the maximum amount a family would receive in superannuation contributions is up to around $3,000 per birth. Modelling suggests that a median female earner's superannuation balance would be around $4,250 higher at retirement.

        Recommendation 16

       <p class="italic">
        In light of recent and forthcoming legislative amendments, the committee recommends the Australian Government consider mechanisms to fund and implement a pathway to reach international best practice of 52 weeks of paid parental leave. The government-funded leave should be paid at least at the minimum full-time wage, with consideration given to encouraging employers to top up payments to full wage replacement.
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        Australia takes a hybrid approach to parental leave, where the Government payment is a minimum entitlement designed to complement employer-provided leave. To extend the length of time parents can take off after birth or adoption, they can receive the Government payment before, after, or at the same time as employer-paid leave.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the
        <i>
         Paid Parental Leave Amendment (More Support for Working Families) Act 2024,
        </i>
        the Paid Parental Leave scheme will progressively expand to 26 weeks by 2026. From 1 July 2024, 2 weeks of payment will be added each year to 2026, increasing the maximum entitlement by 6 weeks. This amendment will also progressively increase the number of 'use it or lose it' weeks reserved for each parent in a couple. From 1 July 2026, 4 weeks will be reserved for each parent in a couple, and couples can take up to 4 weeks of payment at the same time to encourage greater sharing of care giving responsibilities. If you are a single parent, you can still share your days with the other parent. If you choose not to, you can get the full number of days.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also committed to making superannuation guarantee equivalent payments on Government-funded paid parental leave from for parents of babies born on or after 1 July 2025.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

In addition, the Government will make Superannuation Guarantee equivalent payments on Government-funded paid parental leave for babies born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025. This recognises the important contribution parents make to society, by reducing the impact career-breaks to care for young children have on superannuation balances.
