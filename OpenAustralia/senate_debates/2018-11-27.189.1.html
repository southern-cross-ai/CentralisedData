              So, here we go again. As a male, I find it offensive—abhorrent, even—to sit in this chamber and have to listen to Senator Anning's disgusting diatribes. It's hard to imagine how deleterious it must be for female senators. It was awful to sit with my female staff at the last sitting—going through the reds, as we say—and to read Senator Anning's claims about abortion being, in his words as then circulated, 'state sanctioned murder and Queensland's new child-killing laws'. He's since cleaned up the wording in his new motion. But I just want to register my disgust that a male senator would deliberately use language that is hurtful to all Australian women who've had to make painful decisions about terminating a pregnancy.

                 There are people, like Senator Anning and Senator O'Sullivan, who are so concerned with policing what women can do with their bodies that they're happy to trot out the old lie about late-term abortions. It is clear that if these senators actually cared about children they'd spend their time in the Senate talking about the plight of children locked up in offshore detention, who are self-harming as a result of the conditions they're being kept in by this government. They'd be calling for a rise in the minimum wage and more support for families who are struggling to make ends meet, because right now there are 739,000 Australian children living in poverty. These are the children those senators should be worried about. They would also be calling for this government to finally take action against the very real national security crisis of violence against women. The most dangerous place for a woman and her children to be is in her own home because she is most likely to be killed or injured by someone she knows, yet all we hear is about how women need to be further controlled when it comes to their bodies.

                    Just to clarify for Senator Hinch and Senator Waters regarding murder: section 313 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 formally contained two offences in relation to killing an unborn child. It specified:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    (1) Any person who, when a female is about to be delivered of a child, prevents the child from being born alive by any act or omission of such a nature that, if the child had been born alive and had then died, the person would be deemed to have unlawfully killed the child, is guilty of a crime, and is liable to imprisonment for life.
