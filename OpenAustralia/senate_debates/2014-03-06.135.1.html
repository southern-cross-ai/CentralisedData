       <p class="italic">
        On 31 January 2012, the then Minister for Defence approved a multi-year grant to Fisher House. The grant was for a total amount of $225,000, with the first payment of $125,000 being made in 2011-12 and four consecutive payments of $25,000 over the period 2012-13 to 2015-16.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        ensure that

       <p class="italic">
        Government Response - Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In response to an individual favourable private ruling from the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Defence sought similar treatment to negate individuals having to apply. In August 2013 the Australian Taxation Office released a Public Ruling (Taxation Determination 2013/18) that provides a favourable outcome regarding the tax treatment for war wound personnel returning to Australia. With the release of the Public Ruling, which ADF personnel can rely upon, and in lieu of a Private Binding Ruling, the Australian Taxation Office issued Defence a General Guidance letter. Defence is working on a communication strategy to ensure all ADF personnel who have been wounded over the last decade are made aware of this change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence ensure that Australian Defence Force personnel medically evacuated to Australia continue to accrue War Service Leave and allowances for the notional length of their operational deployment, or the actual length of the deployment of their unit.

        War Service Leave is accrued for rendering operational service, including periods of hospitalisation. Subsequent periods of recovery do not accrue War Service Leave. Unpaid allowances for the period are already covered under the

       <p class="italic">
        With a positive Public Ruling issued by the Australian Taxation Office (as per Recommendation 2), the Department of Defence will apply Taxation Determination 2013/18 from the 2013-2014 financial year and will advise ADF personnel of their ability to seek reimbursement of their tax from the Australian Taxation Office for prior financial years if eligible.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence annually publish detailed written assessments of garrison health care contractor key performance indicator statistics. The Committee further recommends that the written assessments include the results of an ongoing survey of Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel regarding their experiences with the performance of garrison health care contractors.

        Recommendation 6

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DVA undertook a comprehensive review of complementary therapies in 2010, and the evidence did not support extending coverage to services provided by complementary therapy providers under the Gold and White Card arrangements.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        considers that, at the current time, there is not sufficient evidence available to support broader access to complementary therapies through DVA funded treatment arrangements.

       <p class="italic">
        DVA funds the Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health to provide advice on emerging evidence on new treatment modalities for mental health, and is consulting with the Centre on the emerging evidence for potential adjunct therapies (such as art or music therapy) that could complement evidence-based treatment in the future.

The Department of Defence's response to the findings of the 2010 ADF Mental Health Prevalence and Wellbeing Study have been published in the 2011 ADF Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy and the ADF Mental Health and Wellbeing Plan 2012-15.

        Recommendation 9

       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs undertake a study into psychological support of partners and families of Australian Defence Force (ADF) members and ex-ADF members. The Committee further recommends that the study be conducted with the objective of developing recommendations to overcome partners' and families' mental health issues that may be highlighted by the study.

       <p class="italic">
        The departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs are working collaboratively on a strategic framework to facilitate and prioritise research programs, with families as one of the initial four research domains for the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). However the recommendation of a specific study into the psychological support of partners and families of ADF members and ex-ADF members is not supported. The departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs have numerous programs and services in support of partners and families of ADF and ex-ADF members that have been developed from existing available research and evidence base in recognition of their psychological and social needs. Department of Defence as part of the Simpson Assist Program will initiate research in late 2013 into the role and needs of families in the rehabilitation of wounded, ill or injured ADF members.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The departments of Defence and Veterans ' Affairs are working together to further the recommendations of The Health and Wellbeing of Female Vietnam and Contemporary Veterans report, including through the establishment of the ADF Service Women Steering Committee in May 2013. The Committee will report to the Repatriation and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commissions in late 2013 to provide information to guide both DVA and the Department of Defence in future policy and program design for female servicewomen and ex-servicewomen.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 10

        Recommendation 11

       <p class="italic">
        The departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs recognise that the use of a common identification number has the potential to improve the transition of Australian Defence Force personnel by reducing complexity, aiding proof of identification processes, and expediting data exchange. The Department of Veterans' Affairs, in consultation with Defence, is undertaking a scoping exercise to identify possible solutions and to inform a cost / benefit analysis.

        Recommendation 12

        In the current fiscal environment, the Government is not in a position to consider the conduct of a cost / benefit study of a comprehensive uncontested veteran health care liability model.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Existing Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) arrangements provide access to "non-liability" health cover for conditions including malignant neoplasia, pulmonary tuberculosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression for those with operational service. Initiatives included in the 2013-14 Budget will expand mental health non-liability arrangements to include treatment for alcohol and substance misuse disorders, and provide coverage to former personnel with three years peacetime service since 1994. This extends the current eligibility already available to those with service between 1972 and 1994.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any proposal to further extend "non-liability" access to DVA health care arrangements to a broader group of former service personnel would involve significant additional financial costs to the Commonwealth and is not a priority at this time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Also under DVA arrangements comprehensive health care is available for treatment of conditions which have been accepted by the Department as service related.

        Ensuring that discharging serving members transition smoothly from the Defence forces to the broader community is a priority for the Government. This includes ensuring a smooth transition from Defence to broader community health care arrangements. DVA has a range of initiatives to engage with the health provider community to support the recognition of military experience and to recognise potential impacts on health and health care needs of their service. This includes the introduction from 1 July 2014 of a new Post Discharge

        The impact of military experience on the health and potential health care needs of current and former serving personnel and their families is an important issue. It is important too, that a treating clinician is able to take account of the possible impacts of military service. The Government notes the Committee ' s recommendation to include a military/ex-military check box as a standard feature on all medical forms, as a way of improving the recognition of the potential impacts of military experience by providers within the health care system. Implementation of this proposed approach would have implications for multiple Commonwealth Departments and agencies, State health departments, private health care providers and consumers, involving a range of practical, logistical and potential privacy issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposal to include information on all medical forms may not represent the most effective and efficient means of improving health provider awareness of the impacts of military experience on health and health needs. The Department of Veterans ' Affairs (DVA) already has a range of activities to raise awareness of health care providers, and regards this as a priority area. These activities include regular consultation and communication with health professionals and their representative organisations, online and face to face training provision, and a comprehensive mental health website -

        Mental Health Checks - The Department of Defence has recently reviewed and updated its policy and procedures on operational mental health screening, introducing a risk-indicated approach to this process. This approach varies the type of mental health support necessary according to the length and nature of the deployment. This enables mental health screening to target populations at elevated risk of mental health problems, reducing the potential for over screening of Department of Defence members and ensuring the most efficient use of Department of Defence ' s mental health workforce.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Health Checks - There are rigorous systems in place to confirm pre-deployment health checks, including review by the senior medical officer at Headquarters Joint Operations Command for personnel with a restricted Medical Employment Classification, and those with restrictions that might limit their employability in an Area of Operations. The current post-deployment health check form was introduced in February 2011. The pre-deployment health screen form was revised and issued in March 2013. Policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and revised where required.

Mandatory suicide awareness training and alcohol and other drugs training are annual requirements for all personnel. Other courses are provided during recruitment and command training, and on an as-required basis. ADF Mental Health Day, first held in October 2012, is aimed at raising awareness of mental health issues and is now an annual event. Post-deployment mental health support already includes a psycho-education brief on issues such as common responses to trauma, the signs and symptoms of mental health concerns, where and how to access support and tips to assist with post-deployment reintegration.

        Suicide in the current and former serving community is a tragic and complex issue and the Government takes this issue very seriously. Assessment of suicide rates in the military is already occurring as business-as-usual in Joint Health Command as part of the ADF Suicide Prevention Program. Department of Defence currently tracks the prevalence of suspected deaths by suicide amongst the full time currently serving Department of Defence members. Assessments of suicide prevalence, including demographics of gender, service, location, age, and yearly comparisons are routinely conducted and reported.

         Independent Study into Suicide in the Ex-Service Community

        , conducted by Professor Dunt, found that the research remains "...largely inconclusive as to whether or not veterans are at greater risk of suicide than the general population, and if they are at increased risk what risk factors are specific to this population". It is extremely difficult to accurately assess suicide rates in the ex-serving community because the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) may only be formally notified of a death by suicide when a claim for compensation in relation to the death is made to DVA. As such, rather than an assessment of suicide rates, DVA's future focus will be on preventing suicide, building resilience, and providing information on how and where to seek help for those at risk of suicide or affected by it.

        It is not evident from the report what the Committee intended by the phrase " being less prescriptive and allowing greater flexibility " . While the Department of Veterans ' Affairs (DVA) seeks to be flexible in its service delivery to clients, introducing flexibility to the Statements of Principles regime would undermine its purpose and reduce its value in underpinning evidence based decisions. The issue of increased flexibility in the application of Statements of Principles was considered by the Review of Military Compensation Arrangements which reported in February 2011. The Review Committee examined whether there should be some scope for decision makers to exercise discretion in individual circumstances where there is substantial compliance with a Statements of Principles. However, the Committee recommended that there should be no change to the current Statements of Principles regime as this would undermine a system based on sound medical-scientific evidence. The former Government accepted this recommendation and stated: "The Government is satisfied that the strengths of the Statements of Principles regime lie in the consistency of outcomes and reliance on sound medical scientific evidence".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Statements of Principles regime is a well established and core element of the Repatriation system. They are internationally recognised as providing a quality decision making tool. There is strong support for the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Statements of Principles regime from ex-Service organisations and the ex-Service community. A view is sometimes expressed that Statements of Principles do not address effectively Australian Defence Force occupational hazards, for example those relating to multiple chemical exposure such as in the F-111 fuel tank maintenance personnel and Australian Defence Force fire fighters cases. The Repatriation Medical Authority accesses advice from a range of advisers, including an Australian Defence Force medical practitioner from Joint Health Command, prior to finalising Statements of Principles to ensure that all Australian Defence Force occupational hazards have been considered. In some classes of claims, the exact nature and extent of occupational exposures suffered by Australian Defence Force members is not clear. This is often an evidentiary issue rather than one that can be addressed by the Statements of Principles regime. The call for greater flexibility in these circumstances is not able to be met through the Statements of Principles Regime.
