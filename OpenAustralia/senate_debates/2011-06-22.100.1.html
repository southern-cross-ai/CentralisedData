        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Arbib. Can the minister explain to the Senate why, for its national performance report 2009-10, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG

        Reform Council was not given enough performance data to provide comprehensive reports for the four national partnerships that underpin the National Affordable Housing Agreement—those being social housing, remote Indigenous housing, homelessness and the Nation Building and Jobs Plan?

         I thank Senator Payne for her question. Senator Payne, I know, is responsible for the

         area and asks many questions in this chamber about COAG, in particular with respect to housing. In terms of housing, while COAG has processes, what I am concerned about as a minister who deals with social housing and affordable housing day in and day out is results. We are working with our state and territory colleagues to get results in the areas of affordable housing, Indigenous housing and social housing.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have spoken in this chamber on a number of occasions about the work that we have done in terms of the social housing initiative. Already almost 14½ thousand units and premises have been built with the federal government working with the state government, which will help many people who are homeless get access to housing. We have also provided 80,000 repairs under the social housing initiative. As I reported to the Senate, we have now constructed 20,000 dwellings when you include

          I know that those opposite do not care about affordable housing. Under the old coalition government, there was no housing minister and there was no policy for affordable housing, except to blame the states day in and day out. What did then

          do? He blamed the states. We know that coalition senators have no commitment whatsoever to affordable housing and no commitment to any plan on housing. They had no plan on housing, except to blame the states for 12 years. That was your policy.

             . I note the minister's reference to 'results' in the beginning of his answer. I would have thought, Minister, that the provision of performance data would be a good indicator for results. Can the minister further explain how it is possible that a performance indicator for the outcome 'that people have access to housing through an efficient and responsive housing market' has not been developed in the 18 months since the National Affordable Housing Agreement was finalised?

              We have been working with the states to try and ensure that we have in place the data required. But there is a good reason why it has taken time to get this performance data in place. Previously, in the coalition's 12 years, there was no performance data whatsoever, and why was that? Because there was no performance. For 12 years the Liberals and the Nationals sat on their hands when it came to affordable housing and when it came to social housing. They were not interested in it. There was no housing minister under the coalition. You did not care about it. You blamed the states, day in, day out, and that is why today you are full of interjections on other issues. You do not want to discuss affordable housing because you never had a policy on it. We are delivering for homeless people—$20 billion into the sector for the homeless, for social housing and for affordable housing.

They are your goals, they are your objectives and there is no data.

                  Senator, I will actually give you some data. If you request data, we will give you some data. In terms of the social housing initiative: 14,500 are complete; 80,000 premises have been repaired; 31,000 families are benefiting already; in terms of

                  </a>
                  , over 3,500 are now complete, and there are 50,000 in total. This is the record of the Gillard government. We are getting on with the job of actually rolling out housing—building houses. They talk about data. We are actually delivering bricks and mortar on the ground. In terms of jobs, 15,000 jobs for tradespeople, jobs for apprentices, jobs for labourers. You did not care. You voted against the stimulus package. You voted against those houses being built. That is the Liberal Party's record. Shame on you!
