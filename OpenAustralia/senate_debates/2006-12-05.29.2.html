        My question is to the Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro. Can the minister confirm that, after having been accredited for a full three years earlier this year, the Viewhills Manor nursing home in Victoria was found to have failed six critical care standards in October? Is the minister aware that, despite there being 36 residents with high-care needs in the facility, there was no division 1 registered nurse employed to evaluate resident care and provide appropriate clinical supervision? Didn’t the assessment team also find that the residents were not receiving the right medication in the right dosage at all times? Can the minister explain to residents and families why no sanctions were imposed on a facility that was failing to ensure that it had the required qualified nursing staff and appropriate medication procedures?

         I can inform the Senate that a person has made a complaint about the care received by her father at Rosanna Views residential aged-care facility—is that the nursing home?

           , if it had been the Rosanna nursing home, I could have provided the senator with a comprehensive answer. I do not have a brief in relation to that particular facility, but I undertake to come back to the Senate as soon as possible.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I would appreciate the minister following that up. Can the minister explain how the Viewhills Manor facility could have been accredited early in 2006 only to be found to be not employing appropriately qualified nursing staff in October? How can residents and families have any confidence in an accreditation system that gives facilities a tick when they are not employing the required qualified staff?

             , as I just mentioned to the senator, I do not have specific details about what the senator is asking. However, I do undertake to find some answers and come back to the senator as soon as possible.
