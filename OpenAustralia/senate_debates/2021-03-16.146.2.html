        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ND" rel="nofollow">

        Act) to enable the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and scientific purposes, consistent with Australia's international obligations relating to narcotic drugs. The changes were enacted on 29 February 2016 and commenced operation on
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        29 October 2016. These amendments provided a national licensing scheme allowing for the controlled cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and scientific purposes while also allowing the Government to enable a sustainable supply of safe medicinal cannabis products to Australian patients.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments to the ND Act did not govern patient access to medicinal cannabis products as access to all therapeutic goods remain regulated through the
        <i>
         Therapeutic Goods Act 1989
        </i>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TG" rel="nofollow">
         TG
        </a>
        Act). The lead-up to the 2016 amendments included extensive and targeted consultation with the states and territories, including through the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs. This was seen to be important to ensure that patient access to cannabis-derived products for medicinal use was consistent around Australia, and that there were no gaps in oversight of the supply chain that could be exploited, for example by organised criminal groups.

        In its Report on the Inquiry into the RMC Bill, the Senate Committee made six recommendations. These are set out below, followed by a short summary of the Australian Government's response.

       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Recommendation 1
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee supports, in principle, the access to products derived from cannabis for use in relation to particular medical conditions where the use of those products has been proven to be safe and effective.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Access to cannabis products for therapeutic purposes is possible principally under the pathways in the
        <i>
         Therapeutic Goods Act 1989
        </i>
        (TG Act), including registration of products in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG), and access under the 'unapproved' medicines pathways which include the Special Access Scheme, Authorised Prescriber Scheme and through clinical trials.

        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee recommends that the Bill is amended, if necessary, to establish mechanisms by which scientific evidence about medicinal cannabis products can be assessed to determine their suitability for use in the treatment of particular medical conditions.

        Registration of medicinal cannabis products in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) provides a mechanism by which the scientific evidence around efficacy of medicinal cannabis products in particular medical conditions can be thoroughly evaluated. In addition, the Commonwealth Department of Health, in conjunction with state and territory governments and with the involvement of leading clinical and patient groups, developed clinical guidance documents in 2017 which reviewed the clinical evidence for the use of medicinal cannabis published in refereed medical journals since 1980 for treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic non­ cancer pain and palliative care, as well as an overview document.
