        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. I refer the minister to the recent announcement of a $200,000 grant to study ‘the concept of levies for the establishment of a secure, reliable and independent revenue stream from recreational fishers’. Doesn’t the concept paper for the study make it clear that it will examine whether the new tax should apply to boats, trailers, fishing tackle, outboard fuel and even bait? Can the minister explain to recreational fishers why he is funding a study to develop a new tax on fishing? Given the hardship that families are already suffering because of rising fuel, food and childcare costs, how can the minister justify a new tax on recreational fishing?

         The only person talking about a new tax on recreational fishing is Senator Kerry O’Brien.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         indicate to those who are interested—and there are a vast number of them in Australia—that the recreational fishing sector is a vitally important sector. Indeed, it is only in recent times that Senator O’Brien as shadow minister has even deigned to acknowledge the existence of the recreational fishing sector, by issuing a media release.
        </p>
        <p>
         We went to the last election with a package of $15 million of assistance to the recreational fishing sector which has put grants into virtually every single community, right around Australia. Can I compliment Senator Ian Macdonald on that magnificent scheme, which has been accepted right around Australia as a recognition by the Howard government of its deep and abiding interest in the recreational fishing sector?
        </p>
        <p>
         Having spent $15 million on the recreational fishing sector to assist it, to help it and to allow people to engage with it and in it, can I assure you that the government has absolutely and utterly ruled out imposing any tax on the recreational fishing sector in the form suggested by Senator O’Brien or in any other form. Indeed, if Senator O’Brien were in tune with the recreational fishing sector, he would be aware that Recfish Australia has had some difficulty from time to time in getting a funding stream for itself on an independent basis. We have been providing $100,000 per annum and we are willing to provide assistance to them on an ongoing basis; however, at the end of the day, these bodies should explore independent financing.
        </p>
        <p>
         When Recfish Australia approached the recfish grants scheme, an independent panel looked at the application. One of the forms of potential independent funding was that supported by Recfish Australia, which I had already indicated to them was not government policy and will not be government policy. I have made that perfectly clear in media releases, immediately in response to the mischievous first ever press release by Senator O’Brien on recreational fishing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Having been told we have no such intention, having had it absolutely and utterly ruled out, Senator O’Brien is disingenuous enough to come into this chamber today to assert that it is somehow on the government’s agenda. I repeat: it is not on the government’s agenda. But what is on the government’s agenda is a $15 million package to enhance recreational fishing, something that the Labor Party did not have the capacity to think of themselves and an area where they have not been supportive of the recreational fishing sector. We are proud of our support. We fully accept that more can be done, and, if given the opportunity by the Australian people, more will be done.

          I ask a supplementary question,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
           Mr President
          </a>
          . I note that the minister does not in any way contradict the fact that he has funded a study which promotes the concept of a tax on fishing and on fishing equipment. Given that the minister says that he rules out imposing such a tax, why has the minister wasted $200,000 of taxpayers’ money investigating a measure that he now says will not happen? Was the minister simply caught out planning a tax on families who want to take their kids fishing and, having been caught out, he had to back out of it?

           I would have normally thought that Senator O’Brien knew better but I think that he actually does not, and that is a very sad reflection on him. I have absolutely ruled out any ‘tackle tax’ or anything of that nature in relation to the recreational fishing sector.
          </p>
          <p>
           If Senator O’Brien were genuinely concerned about the recreational fishing sector, he might be able to answer this question: which are the only governments that impose a tax on the recreational fishing sector? The state Labor governments, through fishing licences. If this gentleman opposite were genuine about his concern for the recreational fishing sector, he would be asking his state Labor colleagues to remove the tax that they actually do have and he would not seek to peddle misinformation about a policy that we do not have and have specifically ruled out. This is the sort of desperation which comes from an opposition that is bereft of policies and seeks to skate into government without any decent policies of its own.
