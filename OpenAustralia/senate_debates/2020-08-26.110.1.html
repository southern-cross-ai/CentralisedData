        Senators, I want to bring to your attention another matter.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Speaker" rel="nofollow">
         The Speaker
        </a>
        is making a statement in the House about this. I normally don't replicate everything done in the other place, but on this occasion I thought I should. I want to make a statement with respect to the medical advice that I and the Speaker have received about the wearing of masks. In doing so, I wish to correct the record with respect to a claim in
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Speaker and I have advised that all of our decisions regarding the operations and restrictions in Parliament House since the beginning of the pandemic have been based on advice received from the office of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Medical Officer
        </a>
        . Last Friday, the advice we received regarding the wearing of masks was communicated to all building occupants and the media. We said in the statement:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While recognising that the wearing of masks is not mandatory in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        , at the specific request of the Acting Chief Medical Officer and out of an abundance of caution, in the public common areas of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Parliament House
        </a>
        everyone is recommended to wear a mask at all times.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As an additional precaution the wearing of masks is encouraged in the presence of others, especially where physical distancing is not possible, and by those at increased risk of COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        The article today claims that according to a source:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMO" rel="nofollow">
         CMO
        </a>
        wanted a mandatory memorandum for the sitting fortnight, but was overruled by the presiding officers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is incorrect. To allow this to go uncorrected would be to suggest that the Speaker and I had not followed medical advice. Further, it would suggest our statement to all of you—that we have always acted on medical advice—was not accurate. To make it clear, we have always followed the advice from the Chief Medical Officer or his office when it comes to measures being adopted in Parliament House. Finally, if advice was received that recommended mandating masks here in Parliament House without that requirement being present in the rest of the ACT, the Speaker and I would present that advice to both chambers. I thank senators.
