        With reference to the role of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office (ASNO) and nuclear weapons proliferation in Burma, and specifically referring to the statement made by Mr Allan McKinnon, First Assistant Secretary, International Security Division,

        , in May 2010 during the Budget estimates hearings of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, in which he indicated that the Government shared international concern about Burma's alleged nuclear problem, 'but the most we can do at this time is to monitor developments in Burma':

        (3)   Given that the Burmese military junta also shields itself from questions and inspections using another out-of-date agreement called a 'Small Quantities Protocol' which exempts states that only have small amounts of nuclear materials and no nuclear facilities from IAEA inspections and close oversight, how has Australia used its position on the

         (3)   Australia has called on the Burmese Government to be transparent about any nuclear activities, to abide by its obligations under the

Australia is a prominent advocate in Vienna, and elsewhere, of strengthened safeguards and the need to ensure that the IAEA has the necessary capabilities to evaluate and act on safeguards issues of concern.
