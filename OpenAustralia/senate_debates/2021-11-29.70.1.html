         I thank Senator McGrath for his question. Australia is deeply concerned by the recent civil unrest in Honiara. I can advise the Senate that, following several days of protests, with some violence, there were no significant incidents overnight or this morning. We do continue to monitor the situation very closely, however, and to respond accordingly. We understand there have, regrettably, been four deaths during the unrest. A curfew remains in place in Honiara between 7 pm and 6 am daily.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia continues to call for calm, an end to violence, and for tensions to be resolved peacefully. Our focus is to support stability. We do not take sides in these differences; nor do we take a position on other countries' choices about their diplomatic relationships. Australia has responded as a close friend, neighbour and partner, following a request from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         government under our bilateral security treaty. This is our responsibility under the treaty and the right thing to do in support of our Pacific family.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian personnel are there primarily to support the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force.

        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian mission in Honiara is operational and all staff and families are safe. I've spoken to the Acting Head of Mission again today. We again advise Australians to avoid protests, to monitor local media, to avoid areas affected by protests and roadblocks and to follow the advice of local authorities.

            is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. We are taking every precaution against the risk of COVID-19 transmission. One of the Royal Australian Air Force flights that landed in Honiara yesterday carried 1,280 rapid antigen test kits, to ensure no risk is posed by our personnel or those of partners. Australia's support is to contribute to maintaining stability, enabling tensions to be resolved by the Solomon Islands people within their own system.
