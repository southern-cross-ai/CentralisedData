         I thank Senator Cameron for that question. I guess the modelling he is referring to is the modelling that has been put into the public domain by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">

         . The government welcomes and has welcomed their contribution to what is a very important debate about the way our tax system can be improved, moving forward. Right now, the government is involved in a good faith public consultation about how we can improve our tax system, moving forward. It is about how we can ensure—by a better, more efficient and less distorting tax system and by a tax system that encourages people to work more, save more and invest more—that we can strengthen growth in a way that will help deliver lifts in living standards for people across Australia and help increase the level opportunity for people across Australia, and, of course, deliver a growth dividend for government, which will help us continue to afford the social safety net and all of the important benefits and services.

           I rise on a point of order. My question was very specific. It went to the issue of the modelling and whether that would require people in the lowest 20 per cent of income brackets to pay seven per cent more in tax. The minister has not gone to that point and his attention should be drawn to the question.

             As I said, the government welcomes the contribution that
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACOSS" rel="nofollow">
              ACOSS
             </a>
             has made to the tax reform debate. The NATSEM modelling prepared for ACOSS is not realistic. It is not accurate. It ignores, entirely, the fact that welfare payments, for example, are automatically indexed for price increases. For the ACOSS stylised scenario to occur, the parliament would have to pass legislation to switch off the automatic
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
              CPI
             </a>
             indexation of transfer payments in order to prevent welfare recipients from automatically receiving increased payments. That would be contrary to the government's commitment to ensure fairness, and we will not ever do it.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the more fundamental point is that we are engaged in good faith in that process—in a public conversation—about how our tax system can be improved, so we can strengthen growth and opportunity for all.

               I have already pointed to one flaw in the NATSEM modelling. In the end, with this sort of modelling it all depends on the assumptions you are making. At this point in time, the government has not made a decision on a particular tax reform proposal, moving forward. We are considering, with an open mind, all of the options that have been put forward in the course of the tax reform discussion paper process. Like
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACOSS" rel="nofollow">
                ACOSS
               </a>
               , the government is of the view that all options to strengthen the tax system should remain on the table and be properly considered and assessed. At some point in time, over the next few weeks or months, when all of the information has been properly assessed and considered and all of the implications have been properly worked through, the government will make a decision on the best way forward. Our focus will be on pursuing tax reform, which will help us strengthen the economy, strengthen growth, create more opportunity and ensure that the important benefits and services provided by government are sustainable.

                  Senator McDonald is quite right: it is a completely hypothetical question. It is making an assumption on something that has not been decided in any way, shape or form. The Turnbull government is committed to tax reform which is fair. We will pursue reforms which are fair to low- and middle-income earners. That is a commitment that we have, very clearly, made. Our most important focus, right now, in considering how the tax system can be improved, is on how we can ensure that the tax system can be designed such that we can be more productive, more competitive, more innovative and more agile, and how we can strengthen growth to ensure that we have the best possible opportunity for everyone across Australia to get ahead, to get a better job, to get better pay and to improve their living standards.
