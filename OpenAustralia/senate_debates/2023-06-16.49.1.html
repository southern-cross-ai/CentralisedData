        for reading, up from 8.6 per cent in 2018. The Australian Education Research Organisation, a very important initiative of the coalition, alarmingly found that 20 per cent of students starting year 7 have the reading ability of a grade 4 student. Review after review tells us that, despite a 60 per cent increase in school funding over two decades, we are seeing school standards slip dramatically.

        outside Hobart I've seen how children are thriving, supported by the most incredible program of highly structured, highly accountable, dynamic and engaging explicit instruction in reading and writing. As I say, we need explicit instruction in every classroom across this country.
