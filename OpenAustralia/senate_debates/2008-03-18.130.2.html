         Senator Siewert, I think you had a question on this. If it is not a question that is going to alter your position on it then I wonder if we can deal with this amendment first and I can undertake to come back to you when I have officials in here on the issue you raised.

         (3)    Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (lines 31 and 32), omit “employee’s overall terms and conditions of employment”, substitute “overall terms and conditions of employment of the employee whose employment is subject to the agreement”.

         These amendments are minor corrections to ensure technical consistency of reference. They will clarify that for the purposes of the no disadvantage test a reference to an employee means a reference to employees whose employment is subject to an agreement and includes a future employee but only insofar as the context permits—for example, in the context of an

          Senator Siewert, I do have some notes here. Perhaps I can read them and then you can indicate if this addresses sufficiently the issues you raise. I think you asked how this amendment would prevent employers from terminating an employee’s employment for the purpose of re-engaging them on an
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITEA" rel="nofollow">
           ITEA
          </a>
          . The government has now passed an amendment that will enable eligible employees to make ITEAs with previous employees following concerns expressed to the Senate committee. ITEAs would not be available in circumstances where the employee’s employment was brought to an end for the purpose of re-engagement on an ITEA. If this occurred, a fundamental requirement for the ITEA would not have been met; and, if lodged, the document could not operate as a workplace agreement. This is a result of other changes the government is making in the bill—in particular the new section 347A—to ensure that only genuine workplace agreements operate. An employee whose employment was terminated because the employer wanted to re-engage the employee on an ITEA could have remedies under the freedom of association provisions of the act. I will pause here to see if Senator Siewert needs any further information on this issue.

            <p>
             These amendments relate to compliance with standards and certain laws. Part of our concern is addressed by the government’s next amendment, which relates to long service leave. We did articulate in our additional comments to the Senate committee report that we had some concerns about long service leave which came up during the inquiry. However, the government’s amendments do not address all of our concerns—specifically around the fact that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDT" rel="nofollow">
              NDT
             </a>
             does not take into account the Australian fair pay and conditions standards. We believe it is illogical for an agreement to be passed by the Workplace Authority which breaches the act in any way. While the Workplace Ombudsman deals with compliance with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFPC" rel="nofollow">
              AFPC
             </a>
             S, the Workplace Authority could easily ensure that the agreement is at least lawful. We believe that it does not make any sense for it not to be actually stated in the act that they are required to consider and comply with the standards. We believe the most appropriate thing, if they need to be in the agreement, is that they should actually be in the act. If they are not in the act, how does an employee know if they have actually been complied with? The onus is then on the employee to know that the standards have been complied with. But if it is in the act then they know that their agreement has to comply with those standards. So it would be a much simpler process for them to actually be in the act.

              I am not sure if the opposition is speaking on this but I would like to indicate that the government is not supporting this amendment. I just want to be clear with Senator Siewert what the effect of the government’s bill is. An
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITEA" rel="nofollow">
               ITEA
              </a>
              must not leave an employee worse off over all when compared with the underlying instrument in the workplace—and this may be, for example, a collective agreement or an award. I am advised that the fair pay and conditions standard applies by force of law where the standard provides a more favourable outcome than that provided in their workplace agreement. So an agreement cannot purport to exclude the standard. In our view this amendment is unnecessary. We already have a situation where the standard applies by force of law and where ITEAs must be compared against the underlying instruments for the purposes of considering whether or not an employee is worse off. For those reasons the government is not supporting this amendment.

             </p>
             <p>
              This inserts a new subsection. The amendment would further strengthen the agreement-making safety net by making state and territory long service leave laws part of the no disadvantage test where they are not already part of a relevant collective agreement or general instrument. Such laws would not necessarily form part of the no disadvantage test for employees to whom they did not actually apply before a workplace agreement was launched. Where, for example, an applicable award or collective agreement is the basis for the no disadvantage test and excludes a state or territory long service leave law, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_Authority" rel="nofollow">
               Workplace Authority
              </a>
              Director would be required to have regard to the agreement or award. If an award is designated for an employee, for example because there is no actually applicable award, and it contains long service leave provisions, the Workplace Authority Director would only have regard to the state or territory law that applied in fact and not the designated award in respect of long service leave. This is consistent with the approach that designated awards are used for the purpose of the no disadvantage test where there is no otherwise applicable instrument.
             </p>
             <p>
              In short, the amendment ensures that state and territory long service leave laws are part of the no disadvantage test where there is no other federal award or agreement for the purposes of that test which excludes state or territory long service leave law.

                <p class="italic">

                <p>
                 This amendment clarifies the operation of the no disadvantage test where there is a reference instrument in relation to some but not all employees. Currently under that test a collective agreement must be tested if there is a reference instrument in relation to one or more employees and, where there is no reference instrument in relation to any employees, a collective agreement is taken to pass the test. This amendment clarifies that, where there is a reference instrument for one or more employees but not every employee, two things apply. First, a collective agreement that passes the no disadvantage test will pass in relation to all employees, including those for whom there is no reference instrument. Second, a collective agreement that does not pass the no disadvantage test will not pass in relation to any employee, including those for whom there is no reference instrument.

                  I moved Greens amendment (3) on sheet 5449:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  (3)    Schedule 1, item 2, page 9 (after line 25), after subsection 346G(1), insert:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  (1A)    An employer who makes an application under subsection (1) must provide a copy of the application to the relevant employee or employees, as the case may be, within seven days of making the application.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This relates to employees being informed. We believe employees should be informed of the designated award that is being applied. Under new section 346G employers can apply to the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_Authority" rel="nofollow">
                   Workplace Authority
                  </a>
                  for a particular award to be the designated award. The designated award becomes the award an agreement is tested against and therefore has a direct effect on whether the wages and conditions in an agreement are fair. The designated award could affect the level of take-home pay for an employee depending on what conditions have been bargained with—that is, if an award contains a particularly penalty rate or not. It seems fair that, given the importance of the designated agreement to employees, they be informed which award the employer is proposing. We believe this is a question of natural justice and that employees have a right to be actually properly informed of decisions that directly affect them. We do not actually see why this should not be in the act.

                   is able to consult more widely than previously when designating awards, including with employees and their representatives. I should also advise Senator Siewert that this is one of the issues that was the subject of consultation between the government and the National Workplace Relations Consultative Committee and I think something called

                    Yes, they do have to consult, but there is no requirement, as I understand it. As issues were raised with the committee that employees have to be informed of the designated award, I am wondering why the government is resisting the fact of actually keeping employees fully informed.

                     I want the minister to answer this question at the same time, because it sounds as if the amendment will go down. Will there be any restriction or impediment put in place whereby an employee or a union representing a set of employees would not be able to ask which award or awards has been referred to? It is one thing not to provide them automatically. That involves some bureaucratic kinds of procedures and maybe that is a little difficult. But if someone wants to know what award was being referred to, would they be able to ask for that and receive information?

                      These amendments go to sections 346G(3), 346H(2) and 346HA, a new section. They are technical amendments to ensure that the ‘usually award regulated’ requirement applies to all designations before and after lodgement of a workplace agreement and to ensure that the references to relevant instruments are correct. Amendment (11) would insert a new provision, section 346HA, which would ensure that the references to each instrument listed above reflect their correct time of operation and deal with the concept of ‘usually regulated by an award both before and after lodgement’. Subsection 346G(3) of the act would no longer be required because it only applies to pre-lodgement designation and would be deleted by amendment (7).

                      Proposed sections 346G and 346H of the bill relate to the designation of awards for the purpose of the no disadvantage test where there is no other reference instrument against which to test a workplace agreement. Under proposed section 346G—that is, the section dealing with award designation before a workplace agreement is lodged—an award can be designated if the employee or employees in question are employed in an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions of the kind of work are or would usually be regulated by an award. Amendment (9) would amend section 346H to correct a technical oversight to ensure that this requirement—that is, the ‘usually award regulated’ requirement—also applies in relation to award designation after a workplace agreement has been lodged.

                       These amendments relate to the issues around agreements operating from approval. Under the current arrangements in the bill, certain of the agreements operate from approval—that is, once they are approved by the

                       </a>
                       then the agreement passes the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDT" rel="nofollow">
                        NDT
                       </a>
                       —and other agreements come into operation on lodgement, which is quite confusing. We received a number of submissions about this during the committee inquiry.

                       </a>
                       s and greenfields agreements—have the potential to require the compensation provisions to be accessed if the agreement does fail the NDT. For employees on ITEAs, we believe this is a particular problem. The compensation provisions are quite complicated and they are not easy for individuals to access. We believe it is much more logical for all agreements to come into operation on approval and bypass the need for a complicated compensation process.

                      <p>
                       There is an issue around backlog and timeliness of approvals which we believe is a matter of administration and should be dealt with in that way, not through two different types of agreement regimes. As I said, we believe that makes the act much more complicated, and the present system actually replicates the process it goes through now, the fairness test, which we believe is unfair and is generally acknowledged to be unfair.

                        I indicate that the government is opposing amendments (4) to (8) and (11). The principal amendments moved by Senator Siewert are really amendments (4), (5) and (6), which, in effect, require that all workplace agreements operate from approval. The government’s position is that workplace agreements for new employees—that is, new employee
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITEA" rel="nofollow">
                         ITEA
                        </a>
                        s or greenfields agreements—should apply on lodgement to provide certainty for these parties. Other agreements, such as ITEAs for existing employees and union or employee collective agreements, will only operate from approval. These are transitional measures which reflect the move from the lodgement-only system under
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">

                        to the Labor government’s new workplace relations system from 2010. As Senator Siewert is no doubt aware, under that new system all workplace agreements will be assessed and approved by Fair Work Australia. In effect, amendments (7), (8) and (11) are, in great part, dependent on the primary set of amendments being passed and therefore we would oppose those as well.

                         As the minister and participants in the committee would know, this is an important issue, and has always been an important issue in workplace agreements. If an agreement only has provisions to operate from approval and there is a long time gap between lodgement and approval, workers and employees can be at legal risk. You actually need a legal instrument which applies from the moment of employment under a particular agreement. If you have a very slick approval system, of course, the problem falls away because lodgement and approval can occur within a short or almost simultaneous time span. But that is not possible or guaranteed in any administrative situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         So, on balance, I have tended to favour those who think lodgement is the better time for provisions to come into play, although that can raise great difficulties if they are subsequently not approved. I recognise that you can end up with the worst of all worlds, whichever system you go for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I have sympathy for the intention of the Greens, but my instinct is that the government’s choice is right given where we are at with the various regulators and authorities, and the distance, as I understand it, between when lodgement occurs and when approval is likely to occur. I cannot see that improving vastly in the near future, so I am inclined to support the government’s direction here.

                          The government came into office saying that it would bring in a new, fairer system and there are certainly elements of that here. The way to make this system even fairer is to accept this amendment and see that all agreements operate from approval. We do appreciate that there are some time lags and significant backlogs with the existing process. I found it ironic that the opposition questioned the government earlier about that, when it was the very system that they had set up. A number of us had said all along that the system was doomed to failure and it would end exactly the way that it has ended—although I should use the word ‘result’ because it has not ended yet. We believe that it is much fairer to employees if agreements operate from approval. We also believe that having two different systems, lodgement and approval, makes the system even more complicated.

                            This again relates to the issue of natural justice and people being informed of decisions. It relates to the amendment that I moved before, which concerned employees having the right to know what designated awards are being used. This one has a similar essence in there being a requirement for workers to be able to access information and to be told about decisions that are affecting them. This came up during the inquiry and I would recommend that people look in particular at Professor Stewart’s comments and submission. We believe it is important for workers and employees to get written reasons and the right of appeal and to be able to look at the decisions on the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDT" rel="nofollow">
                             NDT
                            </a>
                            . It is not just a matter of natural justice but also a matter of basic accountability measures for the NDT. We have raised this previously. We raised it last year in respect of the fairness test and we will continue to raise it.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            We believe that decisions on the no disadvantage test do materially affect people. The test goes to people’s wages and conditions and they have a right to know about those wages and conditions because these are of fundamental concern to them. Given the potential seriousness of the decisions made by the Workplace Authority and the requirement for basic accountability measures, we believe that it is a question of natural justice that people be allowed to know this information.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Also, the bill is light on details on consistency of application of the NDT, so how will we know about the basic consistency of application if written reasons are prevented from being given? When a similar no disadvantage test operated prior to
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
                             Work Choices
                            </a>
                            , there were real issues with consistency of decisions and also with fairness. The application of the test by the then

                            resulted in employees losing conditions and receiving inadequate compensation. I remember very vividly talking to workers who were coming to us with concerns around how the Office of the Employment Advocate was working at the time. We should be learning from the past. People should have access to written reasons for decisions. I would therefore like to ask the government why this was not taken into account when the bill was drafted in the first place.

                             informs parties to agreements when they have determined whether an agreement passes or fails the no disadvantage test. However, the government has inherited a backlog of around about 150,000 agreements that require assessment by the Workplace Authority. We are working with the authority to clear this backlog, which arose as a result of the previous government’s decisions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The reality is that it would take additional time to check compliance with the standard in every agreement, particularly given that the standard, which is 140 pages in length, is complex and convoluted and would require a separate assessment to the global no disadvantage test the government has put in place for agreements during the transition period. For these reasons, the government is not supporting the Greens amendment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             In relation to amendment (10), the government reiterates that we believe our no disadvantage test is a fairer test with simpler rules. The government reiterates its desire for a system which provides certainty to employees and employers, including certainty that agreements will be processed and assessed and the parties notified within a reasonable time frame. As senators will be aware, the powers and functions of Fair Work Australia, which the government promised prior to the election, will be developed as part of our substantive workplace reforms later this year.

                              I can understand that the government is dealing with a big backlog of agreements through the failed processes of the past. However, I do not think past unfairnesses justify future unfairnesses. There is an absolute failure in natural justice here if people cannot find out why their agreement failed or passed, particularly what the reasons were for a decision under the
                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDT" rel="nofollow">

                              . Also, it is a failure of natural justice to be unable to appeal those decisions. As I said, I totally understand that the government is dealing with a large issue here. They need to find an efficient way to deal with it, but that does not mean that workers should continue to be subject to unfair procedures. This bill is about improving the system—the title of the overall package is Forward with Fairness. It is not fair if people do not have access to natural justice and to the reasons for, and the inability to appeal, decisions that directly affect their lives. We have past examples. You need only to have gone to estimates in the past to listen to issue after issue that came up with regard to the Office of Employment Advocate. Cases in relation to the work of that office were continually brought up and asked about at estimates. Therefore we very strongly believe that these two amendments afford a bit of extra fairness in this process.

                               Without going to the actual wording of the Greens amendment, I want to deal with the issue of principle that is before us. I think that Senator Siewert is right about the issues of due process. As a legal practitioner herself, the minister would know that a basic in law is that a decision of any authority making a judgement on an agreement should be capable of review. The normal process would be to go to a tribunal such as the industrial relations tribunal or the
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">

                               . I have a question of the minister. I can understand your attitude in the transitional period. I think it is difficult. There are many messy aspects and nothing is to everyone’s satisfaction, but the government is of course constructing a new regime. My question to the minister is this: is it the intention of the government to take up the principle that Senator Siewert has outlined in its new regime that industrial instruments, whether they be collective or individual agreements, be capable of review and due process if they are subject to a decision by an authority other than the parties to the agreement? Of course, in law, if no third party is involved and there is a dispute, the parties to the agreement can take it to the courts. But in these cases a third party is involved in deciding whether or not an agreement stands, and that agreement process should, under the normal principles of natural justice, be capable of review. So, Minister, are you going to deal with it in your substantive bill?

                                deal with this sequentially. First, Senator Siewert, you raise the issue of fairness, and I appreciate the position you are putting. The point I also make is that there are two other aspects of fairness I would ask you to consider. One is the framework—that is, the test against which an agreement is assessed. Obviously there is a no disadvantage test that is much more substantive and real here. Second, I also make the point that, potentially, delay can be an issue of fairness as well, and the government is cognisant of that. Senator Murray raises the point that I was going to respond to in relation to this. I can indicate that we will consider this issue in the context of the substantive bill. I can put it no higher than that, but certainly there are some arguments that have been raised that the government will take into account when considering our substantive bill.

                                  (14)  Schedule 1, item 2, page 30 (line 23), after “section 346M,”, insert “346Q,”.

                                  This is a minor technical amendment. The amendment would insert a reference to section 346Q in subsection 346ZH(1). As I said, it is a minor technical amendment and would ensure that an employer who has received a notice under 346Q is required to give a copy of the notice to its existing employees, consistent with similar provisions elsewhere in the bill. As the chamber would be aware, 346Q provides that the Workplace Authority director is required to notify an employer about the outcome of the application of the no disadvantage test in relation to variations of collective agreements that commence operational approval. Proposed section 346ZH requires an employer who has received a notification from the Workplace Authority in relation to a collective agreement to take reasonable steps to ensure that the employees are given a copy of the notice as soon as is practicable.

                                   These amendments relate to dismissal and unfair treatment as it relates to whether agreements fail the

                                   . Again, this issue was brought up during the hearings, particularly by Professor Stewart and in the

                                   submission. This is another issue that was raised during the last debate over the fairness test. Basically, the provisions in the bill replicate what was in the fairness test and the fairness test provisions. New section 346ZJ attempts to provide protection for employees from dismissal in circumstances where the agreement fails the NDT. There are a couple of issues with the provision. As I said, these are not new issues; they were identified last time we had this debate.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   One of the issues is that limiting the protection against dismissal leaves employees open to other forms of adverse treatment, such as demotion and receiving fewer shifts, for example. So dismissal is not the only thing that an employer might do in a potentially discriminatory manner. We believe employees should be protected from this behaviour as part of this bill. The second issue is that there is only protection when the NDT is the sole or determining reason for the dismissal. We believe a stronger protection would be if failure of the NDT is one of the reasons for the adverse consequences or dismissal. So the crux of the matter here is dealing with adverse consequences beyond just dismissal. The other issue we are seeking to deal with is to ensure that failure of the test is only one of the reasons for the adverse consequences. This issue is not new; it was brought up before. I do not see why the government did not pick this up when it drafted the bill, because it seems to me it is blatantly unfair and is, in fact, inconsistent with the government’s approach to fairness to employees.

                                    The government’s view is that the protection in this section is focused on protection against dismissal. We note that prejudicial variation to working conditions could prima facie breach freedom of association protections and there are significant penalties for such breaches in those circumstances. We do not support this amendment. In respect of amendment (14), we believe the position the government has put in relation to the bill reflects an appropriate balance. I again indicate that these were provisions discussed with both employer and employee parties to the NWRCC—the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council—and the Committee on Industrial Legislation.

                                     I appreciate that many of the answers I will be receiving today are that these issues were discussed by the reference group. Be that as it may; they were still substantive issues that were brought up during the committee inquiry. I believe that these amendments are a much simpler and easier way of dealing with these issues rather than leaving it up to the other mechanisms that the minister outlined.

                                     As I articulated earlier, we believe this makes this bill fairer and it goes beyond just the dismissal issue. It acknowledges that there are other things that can happen to employees beyond dismissal that are adverse to not only their working conditions but also their work. For example, if they are receiving fewer shifts then it is a similar form of dismissal—if they are doing less shift work and, therefore, less work. I do not understand why the government does not seek to close these loopholes seeing as this issue has been raised a number of times in relation to either the fairness test or the no disadvantage test.

                                       I seek clarification: it would seem to me that if one amendment takes away conditions and others are going to restore them or improve them, then we would be better off dealing with all of the outworker amendments together. We do not have to stick to the running sheet, if it is all right for the minister not to do so. I would rather have the package of outworker amendments dealt with in one package. If other members of the Senate like that approach, I suggest we do that.

                                         (3)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a pre-reform AWA, an AWA or an ITEA expires on its nominal expiry date and ceases to have effect on that date.

                                        <p>
                                         As we have already touched on in the chamber during an earlier debate, this bill does not end AWAs. It brings in ITEAs, but AWAs continue until their nominal expiry date and then they only terminate if one of the two parties gives the 90-day notice that they want the agreement to expire. We believe the more appropriate approach would be for the AWAs to expire on the nominal expiry date. There are two ways forward from there: either they can then go on to an ITEA or they can go on to any other subsequent collective agreement. We want to see an end to AWAs and ITEAs, and the amendment proposes that AWAs and ITEAs cease to operate on their nominal expiry dates. We believe that does genuinely get rid of AWAs and it would encourage employers and employees to reach new agreements before the end of the nominal expire dates. It is in that way that we can ensure that AWAs are finished and that gives extra encouragement to employers to reach agreements before the end of the expiry date. We believe this is very important. We believe this is a much better approach and sends a much stronger signal about the government’s intent to genuinely get rid of AWAs.

                                          I support this amendment for entirely different reasons to those put forward by Senator Siewert. As readers of the inquiry report would know, my recommendation 2 said:

So I was particularly pleased with government amendment (1) and I said before question time, rather selfishly, I think, from the perspective of

                                          , that it is an excellent amendment. I know it is one much desired by employers and employees in my state. I think Senator Siewert has a point because now we have the protection of that amendment (1), which means an
                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITEA" rel="nofollow">

                                          can be made with a previous employee provided the former employee’s employment was not brought to an end in order to re-engage the former employee on the ITEA. So if it expires at the nominal date and the employee genuinely wants to strike an agreement for an ITEA with the employer, I think that is a good thing. It reinforces the proper negotiation and agreements and allows the conditions of employment to be updated. I am sure my motivation is different from yours but I do like the symmetry of what you have done. I think it is better legally, better ethically and better from the point of view of modernising and updating employment arrangements between individuals and their employers. Of course, it would not be as attractive without government amendment (1), which again I compliment the government on for introducing. So we certainly support this amendment.

                                           Senator Siewert, I think you are already aware—let me put my glasses on so I can see whether you are nodding—that in my answers to general questions I did indicate the government’s position on this. I appreciate your views in relation to this but we have taken the view that, in developing the policy implementation plan under Forward with Fairness, we had to provide certainty for employers and employees in their terms and conditions without preventing them from agreeing to terminate the agreements if they desired. I read out, I think, in response to earlier questions, the aspect of our policy implementation plan which dealt with this issue. Therefore it comes as no surprise, I am sure, that the government is not supporting this amendment.

This amendment would omit subclause 2(2)(b) from proposed schedule 7A. Subclause 2(2)(b) of schedule 7A will currently have the effect that paragraph 347(4)(b) of the pre-transition act would not apply to an AWA.

                                              . We had very clear evidence to the Senate committee that demonstrated that employees had been forced onto unfair AWAs. In fact, that had happened since the election. The Qantas Valet Parking example was provided to the committee. There was some fairly distressing evidence. We had one of the workers who had been offered an AWA since the election of the government—a government that came into government with a clear policy on these issues. We are also deeply concerned that many people will continue to stay on AWAs until at least their nominal expiry date. We do not support in principle retrospective application of new laws, and we understand that to merely cancel all AWAs now would create many difficulties. However, we do remain convinced that the Work Choices system was unfair. We know that the government believes that the Work Choices system was unfair and we believe very strongly that there are a number of AWAs out there that are unfair.

                                              We believe that this mechanism allows employees to choose to get off unfair AWAs where they do not meet the no disadvantage test. We believe the opportunity should be open to employees to test whether their AWAs are unfair and to get them out of what are unfair work situations. It would also deal with issues where people had been forced, within the few short months between the election and now, onto AWAs which would not meet the no disadvantage test once this bill is passed. We strongly believe that this amendment goes to the heart of the unfairness of the past system. We are trying to reduce the unfairness that workers have been suffering due to the Work Choices system and regime.

                                               I again indicate what we said prior to the election. Obviously the government did have to consider in opposition, when putting forward our policy commitments and our implementation plan, the need to deal with transition arrangements and the need for some certainty in the workplace as we moved to a new system. The government’s policy as set out prior to the election is that

These rules allow termination by agreement between the parties during the term of the AWA or termination by one party when providing 90-days notice to the other after the nominal expiry date. Under our policy, if an AWA is terminated in such circumstances, then the employee will revert to an existing collective agreement in the workplace or, where there is no collective agreement, will revert to the award, and obviously the Fair Pay and Conditions Standard will also continue to apply.

What does the government intend to do in circumstances where there is clear evidence of people being forced onto AWAs in that period between the election and when this bill comes into effect? I do not know how many people there are out there in this situation but I know there are some. I am sure the government has been presented with stories and other senators in this place have heard similar stories. Does the government intend to address that inherent unfairness? It is even more unfair when people have been forced onto these instruments since the election. This is not just about those employees but is a way of picking up those employees without making the act specifically retrospective.

                                                       was the lack of a regulator to ensure that duress was properly policed. That was the greatest problem. One of the very significant advances made by Work Choices and reinforced by Labor policy is the decision to have a much stronger regulatory regime for workplace relations nationally. If any good has come out of all those events, it is an understanding that, without strong regulations and a strong regulator who can enforce the law, you actually cannot ensure fairness, particularly when it is a question of an individual employer and an individual employee with no other witness at their negotiation. So I would confirm the law on duress was there and was improved subsequently with the provision of a decent regulator. Through the chair: Minister, I hope that, under your substantive bill and in your policy to come, your regulator will be even stronger and even more capable of ensuring as much fairness and fair play in industrial relations as possible.

However, the bill does provide for AWAs to be varied if they fail the fairness test, if they contain provisions which are discriminatory or if they contain prohibited content. We believe that, for the protection of employees, AWAs that fail the fairness test should not be able to be amended to pass it. This bill introduces a new test for agreements—as we all know, that is the no disadvantage test—and we should ensure that as many agreements as possible are required to pass the new test. There is a significant difference between the fairness test and the

                                                         I remind the chamber—but I think the minister pointed this out, and earlier in question time so did Senator Fisher—that there are a lot of agreements currently being processed, around 150,000. That is, there are 150,000 agreements currently being processed that could potentially be unfair. Going on the average statistics for agreements currently failing the test, I would say a good portion of those would fail the test. We believe that if an AWA fails the fairness test, which is not as effective as the NDT, it should not then be allowed to be varied and should in fact have to go through the whole new process that comes into effect with this bill.

                                                          I suspect, Senator Siewert—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—this is another manifestation of a fundamental disagreement about how we manage the transition process and our view that some certainty needs to attach to agreements, notwithstanding that we disagreed with those laws when they were passed. The government clearly have to deal with the reality that there are people who made agreements and therefore we have to have a transition process. A lot of the disagreement between us and the crossbenches, particularly the Greens, is due to different views about how to handle that—and I respect that that is a different view. In our view, the bill enables some limited variation of

Having made the decision we have made to allow existing AWAs to continue under the provisions that I previously alluded to, we do need to continue to be able to vary AWAs for specified matters only. I do make the point that the government’s bill does not allow ongoing substantive variations to AWAs. If parties wish to do that, the government’s view is that they can bargain under the transitional legislation and/or do so later on pursuant to the new substantive legislation that the government will put before the chamber.

I think they should be required to start again. I accept that we have a fundamental disagreement, but this is about fairness. We keep talking about fairness, but I do not think it is fair that an employee should have to keep going through that process if the AWA has already failed the fairness test. It should not be allowed to be varied. They should start again.

These amendments would require the Workplace Authority director to notify the parties, where an AWA or variation made to an AWA has been lodged at the end of 14 days after the commencement of the schedule, rather than 14 days after the AWA or variation was made, if lodgement has not been effective and the AWA or variation is not in operation. The penalty provisions for breach of sections 342 and 375 would continue to apply. In short, the purpose of the amendments is to make clear, in accordance with current arrangements for AWAs, that agreements made before commencement and lodged after the end of the approval period can be accepted, provided they have been lodged by the end of 14 days from commencement of the bill.

This means that these employees would be entitled to be given ready access to the collective agreement and an information statement in the same way as employees on

As the Senate will observe, the majority of them are highly technical in nature. I move government amendment (21) on sheet PA412:

                                                            This deals with pre-transition collective agreements and seeks to preserve section 347, subsections (1) and (2), to make clear that such agreements commence on lodgement even if the new lodgement requirements are not satisfied consistent with the current rules in relation to those agreements. The amendment is required to ensure that collective agreements made and lodged before the commencement of the bill or made before the commencement of the bill and lodged within 14 days of that commencement would not be subject to the new lodgement requirements proposed to be introduced by the bill and would continue to commence operation on lodgement, consistent with the approach that existing laws apply to that agreement.

A lot of these amendments are technical and are supported around the chamber. The explanations for the amendments are in fact in the explanatory memorandum. If the minister were satisfied with just moving the amendment rather than reading out that which is there for all of us to read anyway in the explanatory memorandum, it could save us some time.

                                                              It is time for the minister to get a figurative pat on the back. I want to commend you, as I would commend any government, for in fact reacting to the evidence that was put to the inquiry quickly and well and producing technical and some non-technical—in fact, some quite substantive—amendments. The worst thing that can happen to a government is for them not to listen to evidence put forward by credible and reputable witnesses from all sides of the argument. I notice that your amendments include propositions put forward by employer organisations, employee organisations—unions—and by academics. I make these remarks because I want to encourage your government to continue to do this. Governments are not perfect. Governments do not know everything, and nor do their bureaucracies. It is very encouraging when there is a rapid and positive response to good evidence given in committees of review. There you are: you have had your pat on the back for today. I will leave it at that.

The point that I want to make—and this goes back to one of the issues that arose in one of the first parts of the discussion in relation to both this bill and the substantive bill—is that we are conscious that these are significant changes. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister has made clear that the government will take a consultative approach, both through the Senate process and also in relation to consultations with employers and employees, on these bills. I hasten to add that the government when in opposition did take a consultative approach to the development of the policy and the implementation plan.

I intend to make my remarks to all three sets of amendments that you see on that sheet in one go. I do not intend to speak at length; I think participants in the debate know what this is about so I will deal with it on that basis. When I am discussing the unfair dismissals issue with people who are not members of parliament, they are always quite astonished when I say, ‘Actually, all parties are in furious agreement on unfair dismissals.’ Every political party does actually support unfair dismissal provisions; the quarrels have been about the threshold at which they apply and the extent to which they apply. The coalition, for instance—taking them as a starting point—began their life in government in 1996 supporting unfair dismissal provisions for all employees but agreed with the Democrats, in our agreement on the 1996 bill, that there would be restrictions placed on probationary, casual and specified-term contract employees applying for unfair dismissal relief. The result of that agreement was that federal unfair dismissal applications fell by 50 per cent. Subsequently, in 1997, the coalition began to ratchet it back, and in the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 the coalition proposed a permanent exclusion for new employees in businesses of 15 employees or fewer from making an unfair dismissal application. That bill eventually ended up as a double dissolution trigger. The point is that having provisions for unfair dismissals was still a policy for the coalition for businesses with above 15 employees at that time. Fifteen was chosen because it was the number used in industrial instruments. Subsequently, the policy of the coalition was to set it at what was known as the small business level, which was the

                                                                have always held to the view that unfair dismissal provisions should apply to all employees. Labor did hold that view but have now moved to the view of the coalition in 1997, which is that it should apply to organisations with 15 or more employees.
                                                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Democrats" rel="nofollow">

                                                                continue to believe that all employees should have access—provided, of course, that the surrounding environment discourages vexatious claims and that restrictions are placed on probationary, casual and specified-term contract employees.

                                                                Knowing that the coalition are still attached to the view that unfair dismissal provisions should not apply to small business, and knowing that the Labor policy is for unfair dismissal provisions to apply to organisations with 15 employees or more, I thought I would bring the issue on—just to be helpful. I have proposed what I would describe broadly as Green and Democrats policy: that unfair dismissal provisions under the Workplace Relations Act apply to all employees—items (1) and (2) on sheet 5443. Then, if that goes down—which, I must say, in my pessimistic way I have anticipated it will—I offer up Labor policy; and, if that goes down, I then offer up what was the previous coalition policy, which is for it to apply to organisations with 20 or more employees.

                                                                What I expect is that, when the substantive bill that Labor talked about is introduced later this year, they will bring forward their policy of unfair dismissal provisions applying to organisations with 15 or more employees, and they will have to get the numbers from the Greens senators and the votes of Senators Fielding and Xenophon to agree with that. I suspect they will get that approval and so it will become law. What I would like is for it to become law now. I do not raise this to be mildly provocative but because the issue of unfair dismissal provisions and it being of assistance in fairness matters was raised by a number of witnesses in the Senate inquiry, independently of my questioning or anybody else’s questioning. I do not propose to say much more unless I am obliged to.

We are also moving to get rid of the concept of operational reasons for dismissal.

The declared intent of the government is to deal with the issues of unfair dismissal; we do not agree with them taking it down to 15 employees. I think the Greens have been on the record on many occasions saying we support universal unfair dismissal rights, hence our amendment. We will be supporting the Democrats amendment to take it to 15 employees and, if that is unsuccessful, then to 20. We realise that it is better than the current situation, although our preferred position is that it applies, as the Democrats amendment says here, ‘regardless of numbers of employees in a business’.

It is clearly the government’s policy to deal with and change unfair dismissal laws. We would urge the government to do it now, rather than leave it until the substantive bill.

It is a very simple amendment to delete one number and put in another number. If the Labor Party actually believed their vehement rhetoric on this, you would imagine that they would accept the amendments of the Democrats. If the unfair dismissal laws are such a matter of great social injustice, as we were led to believe, one would wonder why the Labor Party would not seek the first opportunity to overturn the unfair dismissal laws that we introduced and indeed were elected upon on a number of occasions with a very firm unfair dismissals policy.
                                                                 </p>

We now know that the lock of the constitutional lock—namely, use of the corporations power—is accepted by Labor and the stock was having a national system, now accepted by Labor. In relation to the barrel, all they are doing is making it into a sawn-off shotgun rather than getting rid of the barrel, because they now accept the principle of an unfair dismissal law. They accept that principle.
                                                                 </p>

We believe 100 is the appropriate figure. If you are anti small business, you would go to the lowest possible threshold whilst paying lip-service to small business and saying, ‘Yes, we do need unfair dismissal laws.’ Therefore, Labor have agreed to set it at 15.
                                                                 </p>

The argument that we consistently put as the government at the time was that employers are called ‘employers’ and not ‘dismissers’ for a very simple reason: they are in the game of employing people, not dismissing people. As soon as we gave employers the confidence that if things did not work out they could dismiss, guess what? The unemployment level in this country, and the social misery caused by the unemployment level, was driven down from above five per cent to below five per cent and now, with the latest figures, to below four per cent—3.97 per cent. So, rather than seeing wholesale sackings, we saw wholesale employment and the removal of the social misery of unemployment from literally thousands of our fellow Australians.
                                                                 </p>

They were a great disincentive to employment. Once they were removed, as we had sought to do, we saw a whole percentage point plus fall in our unemployment rate in this country. That meant the removal of the social misery associated with unemployment for literally tens of thousands of our fellow Australians. We believe that, in relation to unfair dismissals, we did get it right. We will be opposing the amendments, but it will be interesting to see how the government twist and turn on this one. Because of all the extravagant and extreme statements they made in relation to unfair dismissals, you would have thought they would be tripping over themselves to bring in legislation to get rid of it.

The government made our position on unfair dismissals absolutely clear prior to the election. We do want a new fair and balanced system for the benefit of both employers and employees. We believe the previous government’s 100-employees exemption went way too far. I might be corrected, but I do not recall former Prime Minister Howard nor Senator Abetz prior to the preceding election ever running around telling people that they considered 100 employees to be the appropriate cut-off. My recollection is that that was a late conversion.
                                                                  </p>

Unlike with these amendments, such employers will have protection once they satisfy that qualifying period. We consider that to be an appropriate balance for business, particularly small business. As the chamber may be aware, it is the government’s intention to ensure that businesses be protected by a simpler and faster system. The bill before the chamber does not, as I think Senator Murray indicated, substantively deal with the unfair dismissal regime. These are issues that will be addressed in the context of the substantive bill. Senator Murray, I appreciate you moving the amendments at this time, because it may be the case that you will not be here when we debate—

We then drove down the unemployment rate to slightly above five per cent, and it hovered there for 20 months unabated. Then all of a sudden some changes were made to legislation, and since then the unemployment rate has consistently decreased. You have got to ask yourself: what was that circuit-breaker about two years ago?

But for 20 months during that boom the unemployment rate hovered between 5.2 per cent and five per cent and could not break that psychological barrier. Indeed, there were many commentators saying, ‘Look, the government should be satisfied with five per cent unemployment,’ and that that really represented full employment. We who saw the social misery of unemployment said: ‘No, that’s not good enough. We will do everything we possibly can within reason to drive it down further.’
                                                                        </p>

I accept it is four per cent. But to have crashed through that psychological barrier of five per cent, and now even through four per cent, is something for which I think there are many tens of thousands of Australians genuinely thankful to the previous government—albeit we accept the verdict of the Australian people, of course, on 24 November. Just as 47 per cent of people wanted us to stay in office, we accept that, in round figures, 53 per cent did not, and that is why we are not standing in the way of these changes. I remind the Senate that we do not stand in the way, unlike the way the Labor Party treated us when we won government on certain policies such as

I would also like to know in what circumstances modern awards need a duration. I think this is in clause 576M(2)(f). If they are under the safety net and subject to an award modernisation request, why do they need a duration?

Awards might have a duration provision in them but they continue by operation of law.

I understand that they are subject to the safety net and subject to the modernisation but the nature of awards is changing. Where awards were previously used for resolutions of disputes they needed a duration but they do not need that any more because the nature of them is changing. I wonder whether that is a carry-on from the old act or whether there is another specific purpose that I do not understand.

Concerning parties to awards, will parties to awards continue as parties to modern awards? If that is the intention, that is not in the award modernisation request, as I understand it. Obviously this issue is quite important to a number of stakeholders in relation to awards.

I think that it is pretty important in the discussion of this bill, because it is about award modernisation and it is a key part of that. This too may need some further clarification during the dinner break, but I would also like to ask how awards get varied. Section 576H allows for variation but it is only through the award modernisation process. Can parties make applications for variations?

This is commencing the award modernisation process.

I have indicated to you that my understanding is that these are issues which will be considered and addressed in the context of the development of the substantive bill.

                                                                                             </p>

Given the historical award coverage is industry and occupations based, we can assume that in the future new industries and occupations may come into existence and may not be covered by an award. We do not see why these employees should be without part of the safety net. We do not believe that it is sufficient for the award modernisation request to leave it to the discretion of the

The changed nature of awards and their role in the safety net means that it is an imperative that award coverage is as complete as possible, and this amendment is how we seek to do that. We seek to extend award coverage to employees that may not be covered. That is what this amendment is about. I will also take this opportunity to ask—and I am anticipating that the government ain’t going to like this—whether it is something that is being considered for the substantive bill.

I would make the point that the extension of awards to new classes of employees has, under various iterations of federal industrial law and state industrial law, traditionally been something that the industrial tribunals have done. It is not a new concept.
                                                                                              </p>

The government’s position sufficiently addresses the issue you have raised with your amendment.

                                                                                                I doubt the minister, and maybe not even the department, would have had the opportunity to consider this. What is being raised here is an issue of very broad concern. Minister, I ask you, through the chair, to take a professional and quite deep interest in the matter as you progress towards the resolution of the substantive bill. I appreciate that it is not your portfolio, but I also appreciate that consultation is going to occur not just between the Labor government and outside parties but also internally. The issue is that apparently—and it is very difficult to get the statistics—anywhere up to 800,000 Australians may not be covered or underpinned by the safety net of an award. The issue is whether the National Employment Standards will substitute and therefore cover them or whether something needs to be done whereby a default provision exists for a common-rule award, which applies to everybody who is not otherwise covered.
                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                I think the evidence is that this is an issue of concern. It is a material issue. I am not at all sure it can be dealt with in the shorthand version of Senator Siewert’s amendment, which is why I do not support it. I think it is a far deeper issue which needs much broader attention, although I think Senator Siewert is dead right to be raising this as an issue. At the heart of modern industrial policy—whether it is the coalition, the crossbenchers or the Labor Party—is the belief that you have got to have a comprehensive safety net, which means that every employee has to be covered by either an award, an industrial instrument or the National Employment Standards. It is a problem that has been identified in evidence. It is an uncertain problem; the statistics are rubbery. It does seem that substantial numbers of employees are not covered appropriately, and they should be.

In fact, my home state of Western Australia has the dubious record of being one of the worst states in Australia, if not the worst state, for pay equity and the different rates of pay for men and women. We all know that the average pay rates for women in Australia are well below the average pay rates for men. Research conducted in Australia over the last 10 years points to awards playing an important role in addressing gender pay inequity. For example, most states now have pay equity principles, which allow awards to be varied to ensure equal pay for work of equal value.

We are concerned that the award modernisation process will merely consolidate these pay inequities as they exist in awards, without the Industrial Relations Commission being required to consider pay equity when modernising awards. At the very least, we would urge the government to include an effective pay equity mechanism in the substantive bill. I am already pre-empting that that may be an issue. One of the government’s responses is that this should be dealt with in the substantive bill. I would specifically like to ask questions around this issue and how it is envisaged that the award modernisation process will consider pay equity issues in the awards. If the government does not think this is appropriate, why not? How does it intend to deal with this issue if it is not dealt with through this process?

I also point out that section 576B, which sets out the commission’s award modernisation function, contains at subparagraph (2)(e) the same iteration—the promotion of the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value.

The award modernisation request, as I have outlined already, ensures the commission must promote the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal value, and this is a stronger requirement in the government’s view than ensuring equal pay for work of equal value.

The fact is that they are not dealing with this issue because the gender pay gap is actually getting worse. Does the government consider that the current provisions in the award modernisation request will satisfactorily start addressing the current inequity? It is all very well to provide a provision to ensure equal pay for equal work, but that is obviously going to require a series of steps to address the actual current inequity. Is it envisaged that that process will be able to be undertaken through the current instructions under the award minimisation request?

I have gone through the sections of both the award modernisation request and the bill that we believe deal with this issue. Of course this government want to ensure that there is a reduction in the gender pay gap. We recognise that the previous government’s laws have not been good for many working women in terms of their paid work and we believe that the provisions to which I have referred deal with that. I have also flagged to you that further consideration of this issue will occur in the context of the substantive legislation.

We very strongly believe that awards must be living documents that can adapt to changes in community standards. Awards have been the main vehicle for establishing community standards in workplace conditions such as annual leave, carers leave, parental leave, restrictions on working hours et cetera. We have not reached an end point in the evolution of workplace standards. I do not believe we can imagine that we ever actually will. They will continue to be living documents. Workplaces and labour markets will continue to change and we must have a process for award safety nets to respond. This is another issue that was brought up at the committee inquiry hearings. There was a good deal of comment around this. I would like to ask: is the government considering a regular review of awards and how will the government ensure that their award system remains relevant to changing conditions?

We have also committed that awards would then be reviewed every four years to ensure they remain relevant. We do not believe the amendment really deals with the objects of award modernisation; rather, it intends to deal with—and in fact this is what Senator Siewert’s comments were directed towards—the maintenance of the awards system. That is a matter, including in terms of the commitment I have indicated, that will be dealt with in the substantive workplace relations legislation.

We believe there should be more flexibility in the making of these modern awards and the government should trust the wisdom of the AIRC and their knowledge of awards in industries as well as input from stakeholders, ensuring there is an appropriate and relevant safety net. This is the issue around exceptional matters—whether the circumstances of an industry or sector warrant such matters being included in the award. There was a lot of debate and discussion around flexibility, and in fact I referred to it in my speech on the second reading. This is one area where we believe there needs to be a widening of the scope of the awards to allow for exceptional matters. There was a considerable body of evidence given during the inquiry around the need for exceptional matters to be included in the process of award modernisation.

The government’s amendments on outworkers deal with these issues, not as substantively as I would like, but I am aware of the government’s desire and the chamber’s desire that we treat this expeditiously. I am wondering whether we should go straight to the government’s amendments; we have already agreed we would do (15), (32) and (35) together, and it would then shorten the need for this debate.
                                                                                                          </p>

So I call on the minister to move those amendments. I will take you, Senator Siewert, as having postponed those amendments.

Amendment (15) ensures the continuing operation of award terms about outworking conditions despite any less favourable terms of a workplace agreement. Given the government’s strong and longstanding support for the maintenance of outworker protections, this amendment would continue to ensure that the special terms and conditions of employment for outworkers in awards cannot be reduced in workplace agreements.

Accordingly this amendment was consequential upon the repeal of provisions about protected award conditions. Those provisions are no longer required because under the government’s proposal the full award is the safety net for agreement making.

The amendment is designed to make clear the government’s intention that modern awards can include provisions relating to both employee and contract outworkers in appropriate cases. This will enable protective clauses like those found in the clothing trades award to be included in modern awards.

The government understands that the clothing trades award contains important provisions in part 9 which are designed to provide specific protections for clothing trades outworkers, whether those outworkers are engaged as employees or contractors. In moving amendments (32) and (35), the government is ensuring that, in the modern, simple award system, these protections can be retained and remain enforceable. That is the government’s clear intention, and the government has been advised that the amendment has been drafted accordingly. The government will continue to monitor the question of protections for outworkers in the award modernisation process. Should it be necessary to further legislate to ensure the continuation in a modern, simple award system of the current part 9 protections of the clothing trades outworkers’ award, the government will do so in its substantive workplace relations bill.

The issue was raised during the inquiry and, as I think I have said in this place before, there is and has been in the past pretty strong cross-party support to ensure outworker protections. I have a specific question. I want to clarify something in amendment (15). In subclause (3) it is stated that an outworker means an employee. I have heard the minister say ‘employee’ and ‘contractor’, yet the word ‘contractor’ does not appear there. I want to ensure that this does pick up contractors. As we all know, a large part of this work is actually done by people employed on contracts and, in fact, subcontractors for some contracts.

My understanding is that it is amendment (32) which is designed to make clear the government’s intention that modern awards can include provisions relating to both employee and contract outworkers in appropriate cases. The intention of that is to enable protective clauses like those found in the clothing trades award to be included in modern awards.

The bill prohibits modern awards containing state based differences except for a five-year transition period. We appreciate the point the government makes—that it is creating a national system and that historical state based differences have no place in such scheme.
                                                                                                                 </p>

We are concerned about the rigidity of the process and the lack of discretion given to the AIRC to include matters that may be relevant and important in maintaining a fair safety net. This, again, came up in the committee hearing. One of the organisations that raised this was the

We believe that there should be a capacity to look at state based differences to ensure that we have a rigorous awards system and that issues that are relevant to specific states—those that are not historically driven and are genuinely required for the differences between states—are able to be included in this process.

Our view is that the section would not prevent the commission including in awards terms and conditions that are appropriate and are based on objectively ascertainable regional circumstances, based on the evidence of the parties that such a term or condition is necessary to ensure a fair minimum safety net.
                                                                                                                  </p>

I note that the government has allowed for the commission to include transitional arrangements in modern awards to deal where necessary with issues such as these.

Some were not rolled up in the guillotine and they were very topical and covered issues of fairness. I did want to bring forward the amendments that were in many particular specific instances supported by the Labor Party in opposition, so hopefully they will now support them in government.

Unless the chamber wishes, I do not intend to go through all of them in depth. Amendment (3) has a quite substantial change because, when we originally moved that amendment in 2005, we were very concerned that insufficient fairness imperatives were put upon the

We can always go and look for the exact element. I am putting you on the spot deliberately—even if you do not want to deal with this right now because you are working on a transitional bill—in saying to the Labor Party in government that it is important that, as far as possible, fairness be wound into the directions and objectives of regulatory tribunal or commission bodies, such as the Australian Fair Pay Commission.
                                                                                                                     </p>

They have a history; they have been put before the chamber in past days. They are of course updated. For instance, amendment (7) refers to ITEAs, which certainly were not referred to in 2005. But, by and large, they are a regurgitation of previously held positions by the

We thought that, while looking at individual cases is extremely important, it does not actually deal with the structural undervaluing of women’s work and the work that women are more traditionally involved in, such as child care et cetera. So, while we will be supporting these amendments, that is why we preferred to use the award system. We wanted to see if the government supported the award system to be used as a mechanism in order to ensure pay equity, because it is more of a structural issue than just an issue where individuals bring complaints about pay equity and being disadvantaged.

The first is in relation to the pay equity monitoring powers. I suppose I should start with a general proposition, and Senator Murray did in fact allude to this. We do take the view that this is a transition bill. The focus for the government is on delivering the transitional bill as per our implementation policy. We are not minded to change the powers of the

A number of the comments that have been made by senators in this place are obviously matters the government will consider. We will also engage in substantive consultation with stakeholders about the powers and the scope of Fair Work Australia prior to the introduction and passage of the substantive bill. So that really is the context in which we consider your amendments, Senator Murray.

One of the reasons for this is that we do not want that function to overlap with the award modernisation function. As I have previously discussed, the award modernisation request includes the requirement for the commission to promote pay equity principles, and that process will be open and include consultation with stakeholders so these issues can be raised with the

We have made clear in our policy that Fair Work Australia will conduct annual wage reviews which will take effect on 1 July each year and that the

The government’s position is that it is protecting the safety net for both women and men through our new no disadvantage test for workplace agreements. In addition, as I discussed earlier, in setting modern awards the commission is required to have regard to promoting pay equity in modern awards. From 2010, Fair Work Australia will replace the Workplace Authority and the AIRC. The functions, powers and matters to take into account for the operation of Fair Work Australia will be determined as part of our substantive workplace relations reform package.

One of the reasons we moved the fairly significant shift in amendment (3) was that the Fair Pay Commission is considering wage awards right now. Those will come into force—will be decided on—as I understand it, prior to the substantive bill, so we were trying to influence the considerations they must take into account. However, that is as it may.
                                                                                                                          </p>

I really think the issue of the future architecture, if you like, of our industrial relations system deserves far more debate and examination than it might have had to date. The

There are, of course, instances where that does occur. The

But the Australian Democrats’ view is that you need something very clean and very simple to understand. We argue for a separate industrial relations commission which would absorb the functions of the state industrial relations commissions, the federal Employment Advocate and the Fair Pay Commission—either totally or you could create divisions within that.
                                                                                                                          </p>

Again, we have no objection to those being in divisions. If it is decided that you have a specific division which is the Australian building and construction division, so it should be. But personally I think there are real dangers in the present path that the Labor government has set out on, with just one authority. I think you should consider splitting the tribunal, with its quasi-judicial function, from the regulator.

These are matters of principle—for instance, whether you stick a regulator in with a tribunal or not. So I thank the shadow minister for his interjection, because I wanted to make what I think are important policy points.
                                                                                                                          </p>

Item (2) in fact confirms the policy that the minister has expressed—namely, that Labor will move to an annual wage-setting system. I think that is for the good. This simply says that is to happen now. Item (4) is a consequential amendment.

That is a very simple amendment. I dislike the idea that minimum wages and those sorts of considerations should be done only with an eye towards the economy. I think when you are talking about safety nets and minimums, you have to pay attention to society and what is necessary in society. So I have simply repeated an amendment we put up in 2005, which asks that they take into account society as well as the economy. I move item (5) on sheet 5457:

Like any economist, I recognise the dangers if inflation gallops away. You might get a bit concerned if you were indexing it in Zimbabwe, where right now I understand the indexation would be about 150,000 per cent, but I do not expect any such danger here. I rather like Treasurer Swan’s declaration that, in minimum wage discussions, attention needs to be paid to the tax welfare area as well and to how well people are doing with respect to government policy and cuts there.

My attention was drawn to this many years ago, and I have remarked on it in this chamber before. It was first presented to me on this basis: if you give a minimum wage increase of say $17, in the hand of the recipient it might be as low as $8 and in the hand of the employer, because of on-costs, you might be talking about $23 or $24. That is not productive or efficient for either party—either the employee, who gets $8 out of $17, or the employer, who ends up with a cost of $23. It is important to pay attention to what is being offered in the tax and welfare area with respect to wage claims. Nevertheless, having said that, you do need to keep your minimum wage standard up to date and indexation would achieve that. I am well aware that the minister is going to knock this off. I certainly will not push it with a division or anything, but I really want to take the opportunity of this bill to put before you policy ideas which I would like you to consider when you come to the substantive bill. That is the purpose behind this.

There is a substantive policy issue which is behind this amendment in relation to how you go about dealing with changes to the minimum wage. It is the government’s position that it is better for the minimum wage to be set in an open and transparent process. That is what is envisaged in the Forward with Fairness policy. Under that policy the

Fair Work Australia will also publish updated pay rates before this date to provide certainty for employers and employees. As I have previously indicated, the issue of minimum wage setting criteria will be determined as part of the government’s substantive workplace relations reform.

I am both impressed and pleased that I got a rapid and substantial response to that question. The question really was whether there are employees who are not covered by the minimum wage. Through you, Madam Chair, I would ask the minister if she would table that document.

As I understand it, it is the government’s policy to remove restrictions on the content of agreements. Employers and employees should be free to negotiate the content of their agreements. Furthermore, the prohibited content rules are complicated and carry over into restrictions on industrial actions. Employees and employers also run the risk of breaching civil penalty provisions. We believe this is a straightforward amendment to delete prohibited content rules and, as it is government policy, we do not see why it does not do it now rather than wait until the substantive bill, because I can hear that coming down the track. We believe this would help protect workers from this point forward, rather than waiting another two years. This issue was specifically raised during the committee hearings.

We set out in our Forward with Fairness policy implementation plan what the government intended to address in this bill, and we have done so. We have kept faith with those election commitments. We do have a policy to introduce a simple and balanced collective bargaining framework, and the government are currently consulting with a range of parties in relation to many issues relevant to the substantive legislation, including agreement making.

I have stated that I am not going to respond to hypothetical scenarios. If the question is ‘Do those provisions continue?’ clearly, as a matter of law, they do. If amendments are not carried by the chamber and there are no amendments on these issues proposed by the government, then the provisions continue. I reiterate: this bill goes to those issues that we said it would in our implementation plan, in terms of the scope of the transition bill. These issues pertain to agreement making. The government will consult all relevant stakeholders and those issues will be addressed in the substantive legislation.

I would like to point out, as I briefly indicated in the previous discussion, that these amendments also relate to operational reasons. We have seen a number of high-profile cases since

Redundancy has always been an exemption under unfair dismissal legislation, but operational reasons, as we have seen, go much further than that. We also believe it is appropriate to get rid of the provisions that deal with operational reasons. We differ slightly on that issue. This amendment, we believe, goes beyond the previous amendments that we considered in the chamber not long ago.
