            The answer to the honourable senator's question is: of course I do not. For the last four years, officers—men and women of Customs and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Navy
            </a>
            —have saved thousands of lives in the waters between Australia and Indonesia, particularly those between
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
             Christmas Island
            </a>
            and the island of Java. At one time, nine Navy personnel—I should say Defence personnel, because some of them were
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Air Force
            </a>
            people—were actually blown into the water. This happened when, as the coroner observed, one of the ship's company—one of the legal entrants—blew up the boat deliberately. I should say that most of those people were, in spite of the coroner's recommendation, given citizenship in this country.
           </p>
           <p>
            ADF personnel have been—I reiterate—spat on, abused and treated like servants, and they have endured all of that to save thousands of lives on the water, particularly between Christmas Island and Java. They have had to endure the horror of many, many bodies being fished out of the water by themselves following the peril of many of these legal entrants. That task has been a shocking task caused by probably the historically greatest policy failure this country has ever seen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whom do you side with in the face of such allegations? I will side with the courage, the honesty and the integrity of the

            at every turn of every corner. But there are some over there who will not side with them.

              Of course I do not support such a request for an inquiry. These allegations, made by someone who is currently in Indonesia, are the epitome of hearsay. They are made by someone who has wasted his money and lost his opportunity to surreptitiously enter this country. These are unsubstantiated and scurrilous allegations—hearsay and innuendo—made by someone who is completely disaffected, having lost all of the matters that I have put to you.

             <p>
              The fact that a former senator and Labor member would so quickly take the side of someone seeking to illegally enter our country in the face of the hard and heroic work of Royal
