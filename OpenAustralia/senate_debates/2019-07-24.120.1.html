        My question is to the Minister for Defence. Is it not the case that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera_Prohibited_Area" rel="nofollow">
         Woomera Prohibited Area
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPA" rel="nofollow">
         WPA
        </a>
        , is a unique national security asset for testing advanced defence capabilities for Australia and our allies? Is it not the case that the review of access arrangements for mining and other activities within the WPA undertaken for Defence by Dr Gordon de Brouwer recommended that 'a key consideration for Defence when it assesses WPA access applications should be whether companies have substantial Australian ownership, control and influence'? What, then, is the government's approach to the expansion of the magnetite mining and transport operations in the WPA being planned by Chinese owned company

        <p>
         Thank you very much, Senator Patrick, for your question, and thanks very much for your interest in Australia's most important weapons testing range, which is also a very significant national security asset for this nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         You raise two main issues. I'll go to the first one, in terms of the area itself. The area provides Defence with a unique capability for the testing and evaluation of capabilities because of its size, its remoteness, its low population density and its quiet electromagnetic environment. Defence is the primary user of the area. However, in 2014 a coexistence framework was introduced. Under this framework, any non-Defence user wishing to access the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPA" rel="nofollow">
          WPA
         </a>
         must hold the relevant permit or permission to do so under Defence's legislative framework. This includes Defence's permission for any variation sought under existing permits.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the part of the question about Dr de Brouwer's review, I can confirm that on 11 May 2018 Dr de Brouwer was appointed to lead a review of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera_Prohibited_Area" rel="nofollow">
          Woomera Prohibited Area
         </a>
         Coexistence Framework, which you referred to. This review builds on the establishment in 2014 of the existing coexistence framework that seeks to balance the interests of all users in the WPA. The review did reaffirm the need to restrict access—and access only—in relation to foreign investment proposals. On 29 March this year the government announced that it supports the findings and recommendations of Dr de Brouwer's review.
        </p>
        <p>
         These findings do reflect the enduring and critical importance of the Woomera Prohibited Area, as I said, to national security, while also recognising the considerable value the area holds for Aboriginal cultural heritage, mineral resources, pastoral operations, environmental research and other scientific activities. So, yes, we did support all the recommendations.

            Thank you very much, Senator Patrick, for that question. In relation to the Cultana Training Area, all applications for access are assessed on a case-by-case basis, given the sensitivity of the area. The safety and security of Defence personnel and facilities are regularly reviewed for any potential changes in circumstances. I can confirm that is the case in relation to that question.

             WPA
            </a>
            are assessed on a case-by-case basis, given the sensitivity of the area. Defence determines the access conditions based on its legislative framework and the need to preserve the safety and security of Defence activities in the area. Defence considers the security implications of any foreign ownership, control or influence that an applicant may have before granting access. CU-River has an existing mining permit for operations at
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairn_Hill" rel="nofollow">

            within the WPA, which remains in force until August 2024. CU-River does not have Defence's permission to access its exploration tenements or to establish further mines within the WPA.

               Thank you very much for that question. What I would say—as you've indicated what former senator Bolkus has done—is that all companies consider their obligations under the scheme. Whether a person or an entity is required to register will depend, of course, on who the foreign principal is, the nature of the activities undertaken, the purpose for which the activity is undertaken and also, in some cases, whether the person has held a senior public position in Australia. The Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme commenced on 10 December last year, and its purpose is to provide public and government decision-makers with visibility of the nature, level and extent of foreign influence on Australia's government and political processes.
