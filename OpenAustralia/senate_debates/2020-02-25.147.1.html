        Before moving general business notice of motion No. 474, I wish to inform the Senate that Senator Green will also sponsor the motion. At the request of Senators Sheldon, Watt, Chisholm and Green, I move:

           The Fair Work Act provides rights for employees to take protected industrial action in support of claims and corresponding rights for employers to take protected response action to respond to employee industrial action. It is not appropriate for the Senate to support protected industrial action by one of the parties and oppose it for the other party purely on partisan and selective grounds.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
            The Senate
           </a>
           has no knowledge of the issues in dispute and is unable to assess the respective bargaining stances. It should not embark on a partisan and unbalanced intervention seeking to support costly industrial action and deny other parties their legislative rights to advance their interests.

              through another contractor is now boosting its profits by squeezing the wages of Queensland transport workers. The common factor in these cases seems to be BHP and its affiliates. The 'Big and Not So Good Australian' has ripped off casual labour hire workers and leaves injured workers without due care or proper compensationâ€”shameful! In regional Queensland, wages growth has stalled, and BHP is using its procurement muscle to force down wages and conditions. I hope that shareholders will see right through this abuse of workers and dump BHP. It will not be long before the depth and high cost of this scandal will be fully realised by BHP, Chandler MacLeod and others. Tick, tick, tick, BHP: the clock is turning. All hardworking Australians deserve fair wages and conditions that support both their family and the success of their business.
