        I present the 135th report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Privileges" rel="nofollow">
         Committee of Privileges
        </a>
        entitled
        <i>
         Persons referred to in the Senate: certain persons on behalf of the Exclusive Brethren Christian Fellowship
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be printed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the report be adopted.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report is the 52nd in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified, in the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 16 September 2008 the President received a submission from Mr Doug Burgess, Mr Daniel Hales, Mr Bruce Pridham and Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stewart" rel="nofollow">
         David Stewart
        </a>
        on the behalf of the Exclusive Brethren Christian Fellowship related to remarks made in the Senate on 26, 27 and 28 August by Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Brown
        </a>
        and Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Milne" rel="nofollow">
         Christine Milne
        </a>
        . The President referred their submission to the Committee of Privileges under resolution 5. The committee considered the submission on 18 September 2008 and recommends that the proposed response by Mr Burgess, Mr Hales, Mr Pridham and Mr Stewart on behalf of the Exclusive Brethren Christian Fellowship, as agreed by the committee, be incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee takes this opportunity to remind the Senate that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or statements made by the persons referred to. Rather, it ensures that these persons’ submissions and, ultimately, the responses it recommends be published in accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. On this occasion, the Privileges Committee has so resolved. I commend the motion to the Senate.

         for bringing this report down. I will be supporting the suggested incorporation into
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         of the submission from the four elders of the Exclusive Brethren sect. I have not had an opportunity to read what they have had to say, so I and my colleague Senator Milne will take that opportunity and we will no doubt have a contribution to make about the matters canvassed by the Exclusive Brethren in that report.

         At this juncture, I wish to seek leave to table the book

            Mr Acting Deputy President, normally when leave is sought to table we are given an opportunity to have a look at the document sought to be tabled. We have not had an opportunity to have a look at the book. It might be publicly available, but perhaps we could have a chance to have a look at the book first.

             Mr Acting Deputy President, to contribute to the discussion, given that the purpose of this report is to enable members of the Exclusive Brethren who were mentioned by Senator Milne and Senator
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
              Bob Brown
             </a>
             to put their rejoinder on the public record, it occurs to me that it perhaps is not very helpful, by the tabling of a book about the Exclusive Brethren which is evidently very critical of them, to continue to escalate the charge and countercharge about this particular sect or organisation through the process of documents tabled in the Senate. I wonder if I might, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, suggest to Senator Brown that he consider the position that he withdraw his request to table this manuscript. He has indicated that he is going to contribute to debate on the report at some time in the future after he has had an opportunity to read it. In the meantime, he might enable other senators to have a look at this book he wants to table and might also reconsider his position.

                last weekend. This situation is similar to having a request to table the book by the honourable former Treasurer, if there were one, being denied. I think it is a mistake to deny the tabling of a book under these circumstances.
               </p>
               <p>
                In their submission to the Senate—and I now have a copy of the submission—Messrs Burgess, Hales, Pridham and Stewart said, amongst other things:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Senators
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
                 Bob Brown
                </a>
                and Milne are relying solely on misinformation about the Brethren gathered from disaffected, bitter ex-brethren who have had no direct contact with the church for up to forty years. This is confirmed by Senator Milne in her Senate speech on 27 August 2008 quoting from someone who left the church about 20 years ago. Senator Bob Brown is very ill-informed about the Brethren, and has not replied to a written offer of 8 March 2007 to meet the Brethren and have discussions relating to his proposed Senate enquiry.
               </p>
               <p>
                If members of the Brethren are listening—and I know that radios are not permitted in this sect so, if they are not listening, I will write to them—I say that I would be very pleased to have discussions about the proposal for a Senate inquiry. However, I guess that proposal has passed by because the matter was voted down in the Senate after that date.
               </p>
               <p>
                They go on to say:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                The gratuitous and hostile attacks by Senators Bob Brown and

                 Christine Milne
                </a>
                go further than just the Brethren. In maligning Brethren schools, they also denigrate the more than 350 non Brethren teachers and staff employed across Australia who are personally committed to providing a high standard of education for these students.
               </p>
               <p>
                Et cetera. On those points, let me say this: I am not relying on misinformation about the Brethren at all; I am relying on, and have relied on, and have been very touched by, the submissions of an appreciable number of honourable citizens of this country who remained Christians but who have left the Brethren because they could not tolerate the overbearing and restrictive nature of the sect and its leadership under the Elect Vessel Mr Bruce Hales, who lives in Sydney. There are some 15,000 Brethren in Australia and 43,000 worldwide, and they live under extraordinarily repressive conditions.
               </p>
               <p>
                The book by Michael Bachelard to which I referred,
                <i>
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_the_Exclusive_Brethren" rel="nofollow">
                  Behind the Exclusive Brethren
                 </a>
                </i>
                , which has been published by Scribe Press, outlines many of the harrowing cases that are now part of the sad folklore of the way in which the Brethren treat those who would dare to question the doctrine of the head of the sect, who claims to be a spiritual descendant of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul" rel="nofollow">
                 St Paul
                </a>
                . The book is committed, and I quote this because it is in a way a summary of the reason that we believe the spotlight should be kept on those leaders.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                The book is dedicated to those people both within and outside the Exclusive Brethren who have suffered and who suffer now under their doctrine of separation.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is that doctrine of separation which ultimately is the thing that causes such heartache for the mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers who for 20 or 40 years have been separated from their children or their brothers and sisters or their friends. Once they have decided—and it takes a very courageous person—to leave the sect they are sent into Coventry. They are effectively excommunicated. That means they cannot have any conversation with, or any knowledge of, their loved ones who remain within the sect. The heartache that comes from that is terrible, and it is unnecessary.
               </p>
               <p>
                Who are these elders that now address the Senate and want justice? And they will get it. Their side is being put into the Senate record now. But, consider this: the stories of the ex-Brethren get no such hearing from these elders. Once a person is excommunicated, that is it. There is no appeal court. There is no way of publishing their side of what they think is an action which wrongs them. They get none of the justice that these four elders are getting here in the Senate this afternoon. They are outside—they are cut off. I have spoken to fathers and mothers of children who remain in the sect when they have left and they cannot communicate with their children. This is not just something that passes in the night. This is day after day, year after year, decade after decade. Who are these men that say, in the doctrine of separation, it is evil—they teach children that it is evil—to communicate with their parents because the parents have had the wit, wisdom and courage to decide they did not want to stay within the sect, they wanted to move outside. And these gentlemen say, ‘You should not speak to your parents because they have become evil’ because they have separated.
               </p>
               <p>
                The time is not with me to take this further, and this parliament has many things to do. But my spirit cannot rest where we have a sect within our midst which does that to families, which denies all their children the right of access to a university because they believe that their children’s heads will be turned if they go to university. In this day and age their children are banned from that, women from having a place of authority over men in the workplace, workplaces where unions are banned and so on and on. It is wrong and one of these days it will be righted. But it will not be righted by the submission from these gentlemen here this afternoon.

                   Marriage is not arranged in the Brethren. Marriage is only entered into by couples of their own free will and choice without any third party interference or direction. Married women can and do work, as they determine, in support of their family. Their skills and expertise are highly valued both inside and outside their families. Wives are often active and paid partners, directors and secretaries in business enterprises with their families and other business people.

                   Persons that leave the church are not abandoned.

Parents and others are encouraged to contact their children and vice versa, to provide mutual, physical, spiritual, financial and pastoral care and support.

In maligning Brethren schools, they also denigrate the more than 350 non Brethren teachers and staff employed across Australia who are personally committed to providing a high standard of education for these students. Such accusations directly impinge on the professionalism of these dedicated people who are part of our Australian community. These staff ensure that the State’s curriculum is taught in accordance with all the educational standards and requirements.
