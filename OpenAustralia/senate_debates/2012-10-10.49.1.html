        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Bob Carr. I refer the minister to the recently released 2012-17 defence corporate plan which states, on page 11, that in the 2012-13 budget Defence contributed $5.545 billion to the government fiscal strategy across the forward estimates and that this will necessarily reduce the capabilities that Defence can maintain and the scope of operations that Defence can participate in. Does the minister stand by his earlier statements that these cuts will not hollow out the Defence Force and will not affect Australia's defence capabilities?

         I do indeed stand by the comments I made yesterday. Indeed, I can amplify them and they absolutely confirm the position I communicated to the Senate. To be specific, reserve commando special forces training days have not been cut. Due to the different training requirements across the ranks and trades in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
          Army Reserve
         </a>
         , training days are not allocated per se. The minimum number of days each Army Reserve member needs to complete each year is 20. Two commando jungle warfare exercises in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         were cancelled, due to the focus of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG
         </a>
         DF and ADF on election security issues and logistics in PNG, and when I and colleagues reported on the involvement of ADF on a big scale in election monitoring in Papua New Guinea it was greeted with warm public approbation. People supported it as precisely what Australia should be doing in helping monitor what turned out to be, by PNG standards, a successful exercise in electing their parliament. ADF was involved in it and I am advised that, in response to that involvement, two commando jungle warfare exercises in PNG were cancelled due to the focus of the PNG DF and ADF on that big logistical task of election security and logistics. This had nothing to do with budgetâ€”nothing to do with it.

             able to protect our interests and help maintain the peace and stability of our region. As the government has previously said, most savings come from deferring some Defence acquisitions and adjusting the Defence capital equipment program but also from delivering further operating efficiencies. There is also a planned reduction of 1,000 civilian positions in the

                  Defence funding is not off track. The appropriation for 2012-13 is $24.2 billion. In the 2009-10 budget, the government for the first time budgeted over $100 billion for Defence across the forward estimates. In this budget, the government has again budgeted over $100 billion for Defence across the forward estimates. This includes over $21 billion in total capital investment. This level of funding is expected to maintain Australia's status as No. 13 in world defence expenditure. As a percentage of
