        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 280, standing in my name, before asking that it be taken as a formal motion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have an amendment to the motion, which relates to the establishment of a select committee on the integrity of the Prime Minister’s office. I need to circulate that now, if I can. The amendment would change item No. 8. I ask that a copy of it be given to the other parties. The amendment is to item No. 8, in which the words are to be inserted: ‘but that no journalist shall be asked to reveal their source’. Item No. 8 would then read:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the committee have power to send for and examine persons and documents, but that no journalist shall be asked to reveal their source …

                         my notice of motion is on page 11. If senators look at page 11, they will see that the amendment I have circulated would change item 9. That is as per what was negotiated behind the scenes. So it is item 9, as I have circulated in the chamber.

That is the choice of others. I have done the right thing and called Senator Brandis. He has done the right thing and sought leave. I am asking the question: is leave granted for Senator Brandis to make a statement?

                                       by leave—Senator Brandis actually jumped to his feet just prior to the notice of motion coming forward. Because of the business of the amendment, Senator Brandis was not recognised. I understand,

                                       , that you did see that. Senator Brandis did not seek the call a second time because we had some issues about the amendment, which was not circulated to us and which was confusing because of the renumbering. I feel that, under this circumstance, Senator Brandis should be heard—because he sought a genuine attempt at the right moment and, in the confusion of the debate with the amendment, restricted that. So I would ask the government to reconsider granting leave.

                                          by leave—I take the opposition’s point. I was not aware that Senator Brandis had stood up at the time of the motion. If he did so and the President recognised that—or failed to recognise that—I would ordinarily have granted leave at that point. It is a little unusual to grant it post the point and normally I would not but, under the understanding that it was a matter that was missed because of the chamber hubbub, if we can call it that, I grant leave for a short statement.

Senator Brandis did sit down and then the matter proceeded to the vote. That will, I hope, set straight the record of what took place.

I gave leave for a short statement to be made in respect of the division. I was then interested to ensure that it was not going to be a rehash of the vote that was just taken. What we are now hearing is a reflection on the vote, quite frankly.

That is what we are doing now, but it is not appropriate to do that. The vote has been taken and we have moved past this point. I would ask Senator Brandis, through you, Mr President, to refrain from debating the motion, to refrain from reflecting on the vote and, quite frankly, to move on.

Because of the circumstances in which this issue has arisen, there is nothing, other than reflecting on the vote of the Senate, that I should be restricted from saying now and that I could not have said in advance of a division.

                                                          , I raise a point of order in respect of this matter, for which there was a formal motion. It was granted formality and the motion was moved. It was moved without debate. Granting leave does not alter that position, but the debate is now ensuing in respect of the motion. This was a motion moved without debate. Leave was granted to provide a short statement in respect of the matter but not to debate the matter. We know what short statements are for: they are to clarify something, to expand on something that happened during the division, or for some other matter that is unrelated, but they are not a debate on the motion. If the Liberals are now going to use this device to debate the motion, they should reflect very carefully on whether leave will be granted by the government in respect of these matters.

In other words, if Senator Brandis were to agree to such a time limit, I would be happy to hear him out, whatever he has to say.

So, you can give leave for a certain time but, as I understand it, if a senator stands and says, ‘I seek leave to make a short statement,’ you cannot restrict the content of that statement; you can only ever put a time constraint on it.

To answer Senator Ferguson’s comments on Senator Ludwig’s point of order: it is quite correct that I cannot instruct a person or deny them the right to say anything when they have sought and been granted leave, other than that they cannot reflect on a decision of the Senate. Provided you do not reflect on the decision of the Senate then my position is clear and you will continue to make your statement. It will be up to others, if they disagree with the way in which you proceed, to take points of order.

To correct that mischief—that is the criterion, that is the benchmark which he set himself. This is how he announced the new government’s priorities.

I ask the senator to say how long he will be in making this delivery to the Senate. There was—and there is—the opportunity for a full debate on this matter if the opposition had wanted that. It obviously did not. If each of the senators who have a point of view on this were to follow this course of action, we would be having a de facto debate on the matter. I simply ask Senator Brandis to say if he is containing this to three, four or five minutes.

As a matter of fact, it was raised by those to my left, who were complaining about the length of statements made by leave. There was, I thought, a consensus that short statements would be limited to two minutes or a specific time when leave was granted for those statements to be made. I think that, within the spirit of what I believe was raised at that time, it would be appropriate for Senator Brandis to bring his statement to a conclusion. I am firming in the view, as I listen to more of what Senator Brandis says, that the issue is now being debated. I do not believe that that is the purpose of seeking leave to make a statement. There are other avenues for statements to be made in this place. Senator Brandis, I ask you to draw your remarks to a conclusion if you possibly can.

Had Senator Fielding’s motion not been squashed by the Australian Labor Party, which have so much to hide on this issue—as they protect a Prime Minister who has been responsible for one of the most significant national security breaches in recent times—the Senate processes could have worked.

Based on what I have previously experienced at the request of your party in a Procedures Committee, I think it is reasonable. I think you are now clearly debating the issue. I cannot stop you from debating the issue, but I draw your attention to the fact that I think that it would be good if you could draw your comments to a conclusion.

The result is that the Australian people, through the most appropriate parliamentary mechanism, a Senate select committee, have, as a result of the behaviour of the government, been denied the opportunity—which the previous government on occasions like the ‘children overboard’ inquiry gave the then opposition—to examine a matter of serious public interest. Nothing could be more serious than a breach of the security of a conversation between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States of America, particularly when there is credible reason to believe that the source of the disclosure was the Prime Minister himself. As a result of the Labor Party’s opportunistic and hypocritical conduct, the opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny has been denied, and the Australian people should draw their own conclusions.
