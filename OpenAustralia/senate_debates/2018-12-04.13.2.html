          ! I refer to the urgent, unplanned Liberal party room meeting last night, which, after an hour, approved new rules in an attempt to stop the Liberal leadership chaos. In response to the rule change, Senator Stoker last night said that she was hesitant because:

          … I like the idea that a leader has an incentive to be responsive to the party room; and someone who can't confidently command half a party room should have cause to re-evaluate their approach.

          Is Senator Stoker correct?

           I'm pleased to confirm that the Liberal Party had a party room meeting last night after a meeting of Liberal ministers. That was to consider a proposal developed by our party whips at the request of the leadership group which will guarantee to the Australian people that, if

           is elected Prime Minister at the next election—so he can continue to deliver stronger growth and more jobs and ensure that Australians are safe and secure—we will give an absolute commitment that he will remain Prime Minister for the full parliamentary term to the next election. That is a rule that can only be changed by a two-thirds majority—unlike in the Labor Party, where a similar rule can be changed with a simple majority. Arguably, Mr Shorten's position is now less secure and less stable than the position of our Prime Minister. No doubt that is why the Labor Party is starting to get worried about—

             I'm quite bemused about how interested the Labor Party is in the internal affairs of the Liberal Party. I think, perhaps, you should pay a bit more attention to your own internal affairs. Let me say that we did have a very good discussion in our party room last night. Overwhelmingly, the party room adopted the new rule: that, if elected to government as Prime Minister, the leader of the parliamentary Liberal Party will remain in that position as Prime Minister until the subsequent election. That is because we respect the will of the Australian people expressed at an election.

                Mr Morrison, to continue as Prime Minister after the next election, needs to secure the support of the Australian people. That is what he needs to secure. As we go to the next election, we will go with our record of achievement, having turned around the weakening economy we inherited from Labor, having turned around the rising unemployment rate that we inherited from Labor and having turned around the rapidly deteriorating budget position that we inherited from Labor. We will go with our record of achievement. We will go with our plans for the future. We will go to the election explaining to the Australian people how Labor's antibusiness, politics-of-envy, socialist agenda will make Australia weaker and Australians poorer. We will go to the next election with the commitment to the Australian people that, if they give
