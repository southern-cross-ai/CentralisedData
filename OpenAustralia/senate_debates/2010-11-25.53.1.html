        My question today is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Can the minister update the Senate on the recent tragic events at the

         I thank the senator for her question. As senators would be aware, New Zealand authorities have confirmed that a secondary explosion took place at the mine site on the afternoon of Wednesday, 24 November. It is with great sadness that I confirm to the Senate that the families of the trapped miners have been told by the New Zealand authorities that there is no hope of survivors from the most recent explosion.
        </p>
        <p>
         At this tragic time, our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the 29 men, including two Australians, Joshua Ufer and William Joynson.

         . Senators should be aware that she has conveyed her and the country’s condolences to the government and people of New Zealand, and I am sure all senators support those sentiments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reflecting as well on the recent rescue of the trapped Chilean miners, it is always a sad irony that events such as these bring into sharp relief the strength of the ties between communities separated by thousands of miles. I do not believe there would be a single Australian who has been untouched by the developments in New Zealand over the past few days. Many, of course, have begun to recall our own Beaconsfield mine disaster which occurred over four years ago, and the mix of sorrow and jubilation at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brant_Webb" rel="nofollow">

         had tragically been killed. Similarly, many Australians would remember the outpouring of heartfelt support and well wishes that the Beaconsfield community received from all over the world. Similar expressions of support are flooding in to New Zealand. As I say, there is a particularly strong Australian connection and I know all Australians are very moved, and will continue to support that community. So our thoughts will continue to be with the families of the miners over the coming days, and will continue to be as church memorial services are held.

           The Australian government has offered and will continue to offer consular support to the Ufer and Joynson families. We will also continue to offer all support and assistance to the New Zealand government. There are currently a total of 48 Australians either in or mobilising to depart for Greymouth. They include personnel from

             While the causes of this disaster have yet to be determined, its outcome emphasises again the need to minimise the chances that this will ever happen again. The New Zealand government has announced that there will be a number of inquiries that will begin immediately. The Australian government will closely monitor the outcomes of the inquiries with a view to determining if there are any lessons that Australia can draw from this tragic experience.

             reminds us that we must keep critically examining what we can do when it comes to safety. This has been a big issue in

             mines, where we have had a number of deaths in recent years, and I think everyone is focused on the need to continually improve mine safety. As a government, we have committed to funding the National Mine Safety Framework to deliver a high level of safety for Australia’s mining industry, using nationally consistent legislation and regulation. As I say, we will closely follow the inquiries into Pike River to ensure that we take any lessons that can be learnt from this tragedy.
