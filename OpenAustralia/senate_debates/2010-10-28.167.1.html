        I take note of that report. I wish to commend the Auditor-General on a fine report because it relates to the Practice Incentives Program, which is a very important program. It is administered by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health and Ageing
        </a>
        in association with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medicare Australia
        </a>
        . A particular aspect of that program relates to those who are impacted by diabetes. There are about 1.5 million people with diabetes in Australia. About 140,000 of those have type 1. I particularly wish to express my concerns for and on behalf of those with type 2 diabetes. They are not getting the deal that they should. The government announced prior to the election a particular incentive, a particular initiative, and that was nearly $440 million for a particular program that would help and benefit people with diabetes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then we have heard nothing. The government promised and agreed to establish a diabetes advisory group made up of particular stakeholders, key people—for example,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Diabetes Australia
        </a>
        , the AMA and others. That is fair enough; it is entirely appropriate to have the key stakeholders in that group. But guess what? They have not heard anything. They do not know what is going on. There are no terms of reference.

          Senator McLucas was here last week when I asked some questions of the department. She was representing the minister and she would know that I asked about this on the record last week in Senate estimates. We did not get the answers from the department. I put them on notice then and I am following it up tonight to say: this is important. The government cannot keep sitting on their hands and saying the federal election got in the way of action. This was announced well and truly before the federal election. The federal election was 21 August; we are here now at the end of October. We need action and we need it fast. People with diabetes deserve that support. I am making it very clear to the department in particular, but also to

          —look, I commend her, she has a big job as minister for health, but the fact is there are 1.5 million-plus Aussies out there with diabetes who deserve that support. Diabetes was made a national health priority under

            Senator Macdonald acknowledges that, and others do too because he made diabetes a national health priority and we had a lot of action and initiatives under the coalition when we were in government.
           </p>
           <p>
            With respect to obesity, this government adopted my recommendation in my 2006 book. They adopted the recommendation to make obesity a national health priority. I commend the government on accepting that suggestion and recommendation. But what have they done? Not much. Obesity leads to diabetes, cancer, heart disease and a range of other health complications. In Senate estimates last week we revealed that obesity in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Defence Force
            </a>
            was very high, at 14 per cent, and obesity and overweight at 62 per cent—and that is on par with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
             US
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            With respect to the Practice Incentives Program, I will leave it there. There is a short amount of time left and I want other senators to have the opportunity to express their views. But this is an important matter. The government is on notice; Minister Roxon is on notice. We will be watching this with great interest for and on behalf of those people with diabetes and their families around Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
