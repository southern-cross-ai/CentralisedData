         I thank Senator Edwards for his question. In November of last year, the Federal Court found the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         and eleven officials had contravened right-of-entry and coercion provisions on building sites in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . On each occasion, the union officials refused to produce their right-of-entry permits and to comply with right-of-entry law. Instead, they forced their way onto the site and behaved in an improper manner. In particular, CFMEU organiser Mark Gava entered the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_University" rel="nofollow">
          Flinders University
         </a>
         site and demanded that a CFMEU flag be moved to a crane hook. When the occupier refused, Gava replied, 'If you don't do it, we will stop the job'. Another CFMEU organiser also said, 'If you don't put it up there, we'll bring back 10 brothers tomorrow and stop the job.' Gava forced his way onto a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         site with other organisers and stated, 'We'll be doing whatever we want.'
        </p>
        <p>
         While waiting for a meeting with workers to commence at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Oval" rel="nofollow">
          Adelaide Oval
         </a>
         site, CFMEU organiser
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Roberts" rel="nofollow">
          Darren Roberts
         </a>
         was discussing not having provided notice of entry and stated, 'This is the new way of the world,' and, 'Right of entry is a farce.' Mr Roberts became aggressive towards the site manager at the Adelaide Oval site and at one point said, 'I just want to smash someone now.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Yet again these are examples from a list that clearly shows a pattern of behaviour and the entrenched culture of industrial unlawfulness in the CFMEU on building and construction sites in Australia. It is very clear that the current system is not stopping this type of behaviour and must be changed.

           I will also say to Senator Edwards that, when you get rid of this type of behaviour—this bullying, intimidation and thuggery—on building and construction sites throughout Australia, you ultimately improve productivity and job prospects for all Australians.

In October 2014, the court fined the CFMEU and five of its officials a total of $152,500 for acting in an improper manner while seeking to exercise right of entry at the

             The element of deterrence is particularly important in the present case because of the CFMEU's long record of non-compliance with industrial legislation…It is apparent that the penalties imposed in the past have not caused the CFMEU and its officials to comply with the …

             The Federal Court has also imposed fines of over $205,000 on the CFMEU and 10 officials for right of entry breaches on four Adelaide construction sites. The court said in relation to CFMEU organiser John Perkovic that his conduct was 'particularly egregious' and that he 'engaged in sustained intimidatory and abusive conduct' and attempted to 'belittle, humiliate and intimidate' a government employee.
