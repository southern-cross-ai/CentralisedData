         I thank Senator Sterle for his question and note his interest in this matter. The Rudd government has taken early and decisive action to limit the impact of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy. While Australia is better placed than most economies, we have been absolutely clear about the fact that the global recession will impact upon jobs here. Yesterday Centrelink began delivering payments to Australians, as part of the Rudd government’s household stimulus package, providing an immediate stimulus to the economy and supporting Australian jobs. Almost 640,000 families, carers and young people with a disability have already received their payments and by the end of the week Centrelink will have delivered payments in the bank accounts of 1.25 million people. The key payments being made between 11 and 20 March are the $900 single-income family bonus and the $950 back-to-school bonus. The back-to-school bonus will provide carers and people with a disability under 19 years old with immediate financial relief for everyday living costs. These payments will support small business in every community around Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no quick fix when you are facing a global recession but this government will do all it can to help support jobs and see Australians through the global financial crisis. Without these payments things would have even been tougher for small business. They would be under even more pressure to cut their staff hours or numbers. This is the only responsible way we can quickly boost consumption in order to immediately reduce this pressure to cut staff. These payments are of course not a substitute for other investments but they are the best way to support jobs.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister inform the Senate of other measures that the Rudd government is taking to protect jobs and stimulate the economy in light of the worst economic crisis since World War

           I thank Senator Sterle for his question. Our main priority remains direct investment, and that is why for every dollar in payments we are investing more than $2 in schools, roads and houses. Between 11 March and 6 April Centrelink will deliver payments to families, students and drought affected farmers and small businesses. The key payments being delivered in the fortnight commencing 24 March are the $950 training and learning bonus, the temporary supplement to the education entry payment and the $950 farmers hardship payment. These payments are just one part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. We are also making a direct investment in housing and infrastructure projects to boost economic growth and support jobs. These key measures include free ceiling insulation for Australian homes, new or refurbished facilities in every Australian school and building more than 20,000 new social housing and defence houses.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Can Senator Ludwig inform the Senate how Centrelink is delivering these payments to Australians when it is already so busy with inquiries from victims of the Victorian fires and Queensland floods, inquiries from people who have been caught up in the global financial crisis and other important business?

             I thank Senator Sterle for his further supplementary question. In a normal year Centrelink takes around 30 million phone calls so, to be frank with you, it is usually very busy in any event. But there are a number of reasons why Centrelink is especially busy at present. People are understandably interested in the Rudd government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan and are calling in large numbers to find out how it will affect them. Yesterday alone the Centrelink call centre network received 142,000 or more calls. I know it is hard for some customers to get through to some of our lines at present but I thank them for their patience. I want to remind people that they do not need to contact Centrelink to receive payments being delivered under the government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Eligibility will be automatically assessed by Centrelink and most payments will be made directly into bank accounts, usually as close to their usual payment day between 11 March and 6 April—
