         Just very briefly, I did indicate in my speech in the second reading debate that we would be moving these amendments. I won't go over old ground, other than to say that these amendments arise from commitments we have secured from the government to increase the quantum of the Emergency Response Fund, moving it from distributing up to $150 million per annum to distributing $200 million per annum, with that extra $50 million being dedicated to disaster preparedness and mitigation infrastructure, something that we and many other stakeholders support. I thank the government for its cooperation.

          I would like to thank the opposition for their constructive engagement on this legislation, which is very much in the national interest. The government will support opposition amendments to increase the amount of funding available to be released from the Emergency Response Fund in any given year to $200 million, up from $150 million in the current bill. The additional $50 million allocation will be available to governments for predisaster and emergency preparedness to minimise the risk of natural disasters impacting upon communities into the future. This funding will ensure that investments can be made in resilience in areas prone to natural disasters, and the additional $50 million per annum will be available for preparedness measures on the same terms as the $150 million provided for in the original legislation, which was available for emergency response measures.
         </p>
         <p>
          For completeness, I should also indicate to the chamber that the government has agreed to establish a $100 million

          revitalisation grants program, in partnership with the states, based on a fifty-fifty split, to upgrade TAFE campuses across Australia. Commonwealth grant funding will be contingent upon matched contributions from states and territories, bringing the total funding available for TAFE upgrades to $100 million. I again thank the opposition for their positive and constructive engagement with the government on this bill.

           will not be opposing these amendments, but I just have to say that circulating amendments literally five seconds before they're about to be discussed is pretty atrocious and pretty disrespectful. The Greens won't be opposing these amendments, because they do provide some funding for resilience and they do provide some funding for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
            TAFE
           </a>
           . I agree that it is better than nothing, but, in this instance, that is not good enough. The bottom line is that this bill still raids the Education Investment Fund, which has a few billion dollars in it for both TAFEs and universities. Doing a deal with the government to give $50 million to TAFE—that is a drop in the ocean. Yes, it is much-needed funding, but we could actually not raid the Education Investment Fund today and still provide funding for resilience, still provide much-needed funding for those communities who are facing these disasters.
          </p>
          <p>
           And why are they going to be facing these disasters more and more? You've got to think about that. There is zero funding anywhere here for actually addressing the climate crisis. The irony of it all is that the very institutions that will be doing research in not only helping disaster relief, in not only helping people who have gone through these disasters, but actually addressing the climate emergency and climate crisis or training people into new jobs, into a new society, into a new economy, into a new world—those exact institutions, those exact places, are now bereft of that funding that is so desperately needed. I think that is the shame in this law.

            I have a question for the minister. Noting the late arrival of the amendments, I am trying to get an understanding of exactly what they involve. So if I make any errors here, I apologise. My understanding is that the effect of these amendments will be that an extra $50 million will go to pre-disaster disaster preparation. Minister, how will that spending be determined? What process will the relevant minister go through? Is the relevant minister still the

             Thank you very much, Senator Patrick. As I've indicated, the additional $50 million per annum will be available for preparedness measures on the same basis as the $150 million provided for in the original legislation which is available for response measures. This fund which is going to be set up—and it will get an investment mandate which will generate a higher income flow—will provide an overall budget allocation which will then be available for government to allocate, for the purposes indicated, through the normal government decision-making processes. These things will be announced in the normal way at budget time or budget update time, or in the intervening period and then reconciled in the budget. The minister with responsibility for emergency framework management is Minister Littleproud.

              I understand that the $150 million will be spent in some sense as a result of a disaster. That is almost outside of the control of even Mr Dutton. I want to go back to the $50 million. Clearly that is pre-emptive, so it is not as the current bill suggests. I understand that the minister has the ability to allocate the funds, but in some sense it is determined by the disasters. This is pre-emptive. You talked about government processes. Will there be consultation? Will there be a call for submissions? Will there be experts involved in deciding how this $50 million will be spent each year? Is the government setting up a panel? How exactly does that money get allocated?

                     Senator Watt is right and I'm right, but you didn't hear one component. The way we are proposing to structure this program is that the Commonwealth will provide $50 million on the basis of matched funding from the states, because

                     s ultimately are a core area of responsibility of the states. It's a great opportunity to provide upgrades and refurbishments across Australia. When you've got $50 million worth of federal funding to be matched by the states, dollar for dollar, that takes you to a $100 million program.

                      Thank you for that clarification. Noting that that will involve a commitment from the states, has the government engaged with the states at this point in time or are you just confident that they will take the offer that's on the table?

                       The government is engaging with the state and territory governments in relation to vocational education and training in a general sense, and, of course, Senator Cash has been doing a lot of work with state and territory governments on an overall broader reform package. But this is a specific grants program which was agreed between the government and the opposition. I would be very surprised if the states were not receptive to the offer that's on the table.

                        In a similar vein to my previous questions, I'm interested in the process the government will go through in respect of the allocation of this funding. I'm sure that every state will probably stick up their hand and say they need more money than is available. I just want to make sure that there's been no predetermination in respect of which states will get what. Is it fair to assume that the funding will be allocated on a per capita basis or will it be done on some needs basis, based on submissions for grants by individual

                         There has not been any predetermined decision in relation to who would receive specific funding for specific projects. This will be a competitive grants program, with funding allocations made based on merit. Essentially, there will be opportunities to submit applications for funding in the usual way, and those applications will be assessed in the usual way. Ultimately, if the demand is stronger than the available pool of funds, then obviously there'll be a process of prioritisation, which follows the normal grants allocation processes of government.

I'd like an understanding as to when these grants are being decided upon, and one might presume there might be huge demand for these funds. I presume there will be a panel of independent experts, including officials from government, that makes a recommendation to a minister, or is it simply going to be a minister who makes the determination?

My support for the Indue card will be a very big part of that. If you do not have the vocational training centres and TAFEs up and running, you've just lost my support as of today.

                                    colleges and the vocational education sector generally do fall primarily under the purview of state and territory governments, but federal governments in recent years have taken increasing additional responsibility. This is another example of the federal government taking on additional responsibility. Senator Cash is working very hard with state and territory governments on a broader reform package which will be announced in due course.

Once again, where's all the vocational training that is supposed to go along with the card? It is a carrot at the end of a stick. I'm just trying to work it out. It's getting too late for you to get this training in with the Indue card. I'm warning you today, I will not support that Indue card. I'll pull up stumps today. I'll stop following it around and I'll stop trying to sell it. I just want to know because, I tell you what, it's going to need a billion bucks invested in these

                                     s right across the country. I simply would like to know: what is your plan of attack? This is what I mean; it's like your rehab centres. Before you dish this stuff onto the most vulnerable, you've got to have things set up beforehand. This is not the way we do business in this country. Could someone tell me where that money's coming from?

                                      This is a bill to set up the Emergency Response Fund in order to improve resilience across Australia in anticipation of potential disasters and to deal with national emergencies, even as they occur. The matters that Senator Lambie raises are all legitimate matters of inquiry, but these are matters that are best directed to Senator Cash, either in question time or in the context of appropriate legislation dealing with these matters.

                                        Vocational education and training is primarily a state responsibility. It's an established process in these areas that funding allocations are made on a partnership basis. When the federal government does get themselves involved, it is established practice for that to be on a matched funding basis.

                                              and universities. This is this government's third attempt to abolish the Education Investment Fund. That is how much they attack our students, our teachers and our educational institutions, and the Greens of course will not stand for this. That's why I'm moving this amendment—so we can prevent the Education Investment Fund from being abolished.

                                              The Education Investment Fund should not be abolished and should be used only for education and research infrastructure, for our TAFEs and universities. It is the last remaining fund for education infrastructure, and the government is still intent on raiding it—and the Labor Party is supporting them in raiding that education fund. What happened to the Labor Party who used to be the party for public education? A measly $50 million in exchange for $4 billion—which state or territory will it go to? It won't even build one building for any TAFE or any university. I've said this before, but I want to say it again: this is the future of the next generation, of the current generation, not only because they need places and world's-best education but also because these are the very places that will help us combat the climate crisis, that will help us combat the disasters that are happening and that will help us build resilience in our communities.

                                                 There was no debate on this question, Senator Waters. I'm happy to continue to put the question.
