        My question is to the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Sinodinos. Given that tomorrow is the event Science meets Parliament, can the minister update the Senate on what actions he has taken to repair plummeting staff morale and reverse massive funding cuts to the

         I thank the shadow minister for his question because, yes, Science meets Parliament today and tomorrow. There are a number of activities going on. Scientists are coming to Canberra. I encourage all of you to interact with them. It is a great way for them to learn about the public policy process here and for us to learn more about the great work that they are doing in providing the platform for our future growth. The shadow minister asked me about science and innovation and the rest. Well, let me begin by saying that in this year, 2016-17, the government is providing $10.1 billionâ€”

           The question was specifically around the funding cuts to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
            CSIRO
           </a>
           and what the minister is doing about that. The question was also about repairing plummeting staff morale. It was not about a broader innovation agenda, as much Senator Sinodinos might like it to be.

            I think we need to give the minister and opportunity there. He did mention, as did Senator Carr ask in the preamble to his question, Science meets Parliament. He responded to that and he has just started his response to the question so I think will give the minister a chance to respond.

             As I was beginning to say, in this financial year 2016-17 we are providing $10.1 billion in support for science and research. That is an increase of 3.55 per cent on the budget estimates of $9.7 billion in 2015-16. Over the last 10 years Australia's support for science in research has actually increased by 52 per cent. The annual appropriations for key science agencies are all increasing over the forward estimates. For

             it will increase from $787.2 million in 2016-17 to $827.97 million in 2019-20.

             will go from $41.5 million in the 2016-17 budget to $44.76 million in 2019-20. The increase in CSIRO's appropriation over the next few years is from what already is a record level of government funding. We recognise the importance of science and research. We are putting more resources into it and we are looking forward to great results in the years ahead.

                I am not aware of the source of the shadow minister's figures. I am aware that some figures have been thrown around which sometimes conflate scientists with other employees. In other words, you have to look at the mix of employees you are talking about. But if you are saying to me that the science and research sector cannot play a role in budget repair because of previous decisions under both Labor governments and coalition governments then I have to say that is wrong. We cannot have a situation with either side of politics saying that, because one sector is particularly important, it is always exempt from the budget repair. That is always on a case-by-case basis, but, in the last few years, this government has put more resources into science and research, and we have put the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, for example, on a strong 10-year basis. We have provided a 10-year funding guaranteeâ€”an extra $150 million a year. That is what we inherited from Labor. We had increasing prices. We have put it on a long-term basis. We are now looking at the researchâ€”

                   on the right basis. We have seen him take actions to provide a strong platform for me to now look at what further measures we take to promote innovation and science under this government. We will, this year, not only release a science statementâ€”that is happening tomorrowâ€”but we will also release a research infrastructure road map which will have real money behind it to help complement the work we have done on the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. Later in the year we will be releasing a plan for 2030 for the evolution of the innovation of science system. We will have evidence based policymaking.

                       â€”come along if you likeâ€”and that is that science is central to shaping Australia's economic future. This is a time of great change in the global economy. We need to respond to that change, Senator Smith, so that all of our industries can stay competitive. And by investing in scientific research and development, we can not only respond to change but we can also create change to our own benefit. All types of research, from basic to applied, are vital for scientific advances and for generating economic benefits. We believe in investing in fundamental science as well as applied research. It is very important for us to understand that while you do not get a short-term payback from fundamental research, often the biggest long-term advances have come from investing in fundamental research. So for us, both basic and applied research are priorities.

                       Recently, Innovation and Science Australia released a performance review of our innovation, science and research system. It points not only to some continuing problems we have to tackle but also to a number of strengths. The review found that as a nation we are good at coming up with clever ideas. We punch above our weight internationally when it comes to creating knowledge, but we need to work more on turning those ideas into a reality. We need to be commercialising more of our own great research here in Australia, creating jobs at home and creating Australian companies and maintaining their headquarters in Australiaâ€”a bit like what has happened with Atlassian, a great Australian example of thisâ€”and use that as an example to other parts of our economy. We need to improve on translating those ideas into real world products, building stronger links between science and industry.

                             provides $1.1 billion over the forward estimates to support science research and innovation.

The $520 million is for the Synchrotron over 10 years.
