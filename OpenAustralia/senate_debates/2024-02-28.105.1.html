        My question is to the Minister for Women, Senator Gallagher. Since Labor was elected to government, we have seen significant steps forward in government policies that support economic prosperity for women. This comes after a decade of inaction and disregard for Australian women by the former coalition government. Labor's tax cut plan that passed the parliament last night will mean millions of Australian women will get a bigger tax cut than they would have seen under the former Morrison government's plan. Can the minister outline the policies that the Albanese Labor government has delivered that will benefit women across this country?

         I thank Senator Grogan for the excellent question focusing on women. I'm surprised I don't get any questions about women from those opposite. I don't think I've had any, which is unsurprising. The tax plan that passed this parliament unanimously in the Senate last night will mean that every woman paying tax in Australia will get a tax cut. That's different from the previous plan, where a number of women taxpayers would have missed out. Ninety per cent of those women taxpayers will receive an average tax cut of $707—that's additional. This is for around 5.8 million women. When we look at those areas where we have lots of women working in industries—in child care, in disability, in aged care—more than 95 per cent of those taxpayers in those industries will receive a bigger tax cut compared to the former government's plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that women work hard across our economy. We want to ensure that they keep more of what they earn and that they're able to meet those daily challenges and cost-of-living pressures they face. Our government has made no secret, since we came into government, of being focused on the needs of women. We want to drive economic equality and gender equality across the economy, which is good for the economy as a whole, and we are seeing improving results. The gender pay gap is at a record low—Senator Canavan should enjoy that statistic. ABS data last week showed full-time wages dropped to 12 per cent. We don't see that as useless data, I have to say. We do think that flexibility in the workplace is actually a good thing. We don't think you have to be a full-time worker in order to have a high-paying job.

           Thank you for that answer. That was very informative. It's great to see such progress! In contrast to Labor's commitments, we often see our opponents make comments that remind the Australian community that they are not committed to providing women's economic security. As you have referenced, Minister, yesterday we saw clear data about the current gender pay gap. Can the minister explain how the government's suite of policies—

                   The question was about the government's suite of policies for Australian women and how they help assist and relieve cost-of-living pressures and boost economic prosperity. We have made this a key priority of our government. We do believe the data that was released yesterday on the gender pay gap is useful data, unlike Senator Canavan who thought it was the most useless set of data—

                              Minister, you have said many times that what's good for women's economic security is good for the broader economy. How will the investment this government has made in Australian women and Labor tax cuts plan help to strengthen the Australian economy and help women to meet the continuing cost-of-living pressures that they are facing at this time?

                               This government does believe that driving gender equality is good for the economy. We are focused on that. You'll see that in the decisions we took on tax and you'll also see that, by the changes we made to the tax system, that we believe the Treasury advice, which says it will boost 630 thousand additional hours per week worked by women because they will be keeping more of what they earn.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               We do believe information being provided about what's happening in businesses is good. We reject Senator Canavan's claim that this data is useless. I think Senator Hughes called it 'identity politics' and Senator Hume said it was 'flawed', but otherwise the information apparently is okay. This is data that has been collected for 10 years. It's important data about driving change in workplaces to make sure that women get a fair crack at opportunity in this country.
