         Leader of the Government in the Senate

        , representing the Prime Minister. Minister, since your government came to office and abolished the price on carbon, the wholesale price of electricity has doubled and pollution continues to fuel extreme weather and threaten the

        . Despite all that, your government has ruled out a price on carbon, you have ruled out extending the renewable energy target, you have ruled out an emissions intensity scheme, you have ruled out regulating electricity prices and now you're ruling out a clean energy target. Minister, when are you going to accept that having an energy policy that satisfies no-one except for

         Senator Di Natale, I reject every single premise of your question. As I said in response to the two questions I've received from the opposition already, what this government is committed to is a pragmatic set of policies designed to serve the twin objectives of keeping electricity prices as low as possible and ensuring reliability of supply. And the way we're going to do that, as I and my colleagues have told you endless times this year, is to adopt a technology-agnostic approach. We know that the Australian people, electricity consumers, are not interested in Greens' ideology. They're not interested in ideology at all. What they're interested in is in ensuring supply is reliable and power is affordable. And that—and only that—will guide the policy choices this government makes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Di Natale, among the many premises in your question—which is false and which I disputed—is the assertion that electricity prices have doubled under this government. Have a look at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         's figures that were published this morning which demonstrate that the price of electricity spiked and underwent its sharpest increase during the period of the previous Labor government—when the Labor Party was enslaved to your obsession with resolving this issue according to ideology rather than economics and practical common sense. We are not going to make that mistake. We are going to adopt, as I said before, a technology-agnostic approach; we're going to adopt whatever policies will put downward pressure on prices and ensure the reliability of supply.

           Minister, I get that the Prime Minister has been spooked; he lost his prime ministership because of his support for renewable energy. But he's going to lose government because of his anti-renewables stance. Poll after poll has showed that Australians love renewable energy—they love it. So the question for you, Minister, is: who do you stand with? Do you stand with the community, who know that renewables are good for prices and that they bring down pollution? Or do you stand with

           <p>
            Senator Di Natale, the Prime Minister has made it clear time and again, if you would but listen, that renewable energy will always be an important and a growing component of the energy mix. We have always said that. And that is why, for example, we adopted some of the most ambitious per capita emissions reduction targets in the world at the Paris climate change conference. So renewables are not only an important part of our policy; they are a growing part of our policy.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, unlike you, Senator Di Natale, we are not obsessed with an ideology. So we acknowledge as well that carbon sources will also continue to be an important part of the energy mix for the foreseeable future—that gas and coal will continue to be an important part of the energy mix, because what we want is the right outcome. What we want is an outcome that keeps prices down and keeps supply reliable.
