       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is with hope, pride and passion that I introduce the Customs Legislation Amendment (Commercial Greyhound Export and Import Prohibition) Bill 2021.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill amends customs laws to prohibit the exportation and importation of greyhounds for breeding, racing or any other commercial purpose. This ban includes a ban on the export or import of greyhound reproductive material.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Minister or an authorised person may grant permission for the export or import of domestic pet greyhounds. This is to allow for pet dogs to be brought in and out of the country. The Minister must be satisfied that the import or export is not for the purposes of breeding, racing or any other commercial purpose. Record-keeping requirements are built into the bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Export of Australian greyhounds for commercial purposes has long been rightly criticised for putting dogs at risk of cruelty, abuse and neglect overseas. It was the subject of a dedicated chapter in the scathing 2016 Special Commission of Inquiry into the Greyhound Racing Industry in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        report, which led to the short-lived ban on greyhound racing in New South Wales after the inquiry revealed the brutality of this so-called sport which could not survive without the deaths of thousands of dogs.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">
         The Inquiry
        </a>
        found "significant animal welfare concerns arising in connection with the export of greyhounds." An ABC 7:30 investigation with Animals Australia shed horrific light on the plight of greyhounds from Australia in Macau, Vietnam and across mainland China. It led Qantas to decide not to export any racing greyhounds to Asia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But the practice goes on. Between January 2016 and 31 July this year, at least 1,313 greyhounds were exported overseas from Australia. Over the years there have been horrific stories, photos and videos emerging from destinations overseas where dogs are malnourished, kept in small spaces, mistreated and gotten rid of when they no longer turn a profit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I should note that while the policy focus of the bill is clearly on prohibiting commercial greyhound export, it also contains a corresponding import ban to ensure the scheme does not risk contravening international trade rules to which Australia is a signatory.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the moment, peak body Greyhounds Australasia (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GA" rel="nofollow">
         GA
        </a>
        ) operates a 'greyhound passport' scheme for export of greyhounds, and will not grant passports to greyhounds travelling to countries of concern, including China and Vietnam, where greyhound racing has flourished on the back of greyhound exports from Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, there are various significant loopholes. The 'passport' scheme has no statutory authority and greyhounds can be exported without a so-called passport, with the only 'punishment' for exporters resulting from contraventions of greyhound industry rules. In addition, greyhounds may be - and have been - exported to approved countries before being rerouted to countries of concern such as China.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recent reports show greyhounds are being exported overseas without Greyhounds Australasia's approval, making a mockery of the so-called enforcement system. So far this year,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        statistics show us that 87 dogs have been exported to 31 July, including four dogs to China. Commercial exports to China have been banned for some years, but loopholes still allow dogs to end up in terrible conditions at race tracks in China and across the world. Greyhound
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Racing Victoria
        </a>
        and other state authorities are reportedly currently investigating greyhounds being flown into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        before being rerouted to China. In previous years, similar investigations took place into greyhound export to the United States, and ending up in China.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In light of the current investigation, Greyhound Racing Victoria has reportedly requested the Australian Government's assistance to put in place biosecurity requirements or national legislation that can prevent greyhound exports against the national rules, including via third countries. This will not stop the export of greyhounds for racing purposes, which is why our bill bans the export of greyhounds for commercial purposes entirely. Once greyhounds have left Australia, there's very little the Australian government can do to protect their welfare. Only a full commercial ban will overcome the relevant concerns, along with strict processes for those exporting domestic pets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some of you here might know that I have been passionate about this issue for many years. In 2017, when I was a state MP in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Parliament, I started a campaign of writing to major airlines to ask them to rule out transporting racing greyhounds internationally. I started this campaign after the show of cowardice by the NSW Liberal-National government and craven political opportunism of the NSW Labor party which led to the backflip on the ban on greyhound racing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many airlines responded to the 'Don't Fly With Me' campaign and were very happy to get on board.

        Australia, Animals Australia, the Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds, and Free the Hounds. I want to thank those groups for their advocacy against the cruelty of greyhound racing and greyhound export.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a simple bill but one that I hope will do a great deal of good. Numbers of greyhounds being exported have slowed significantly in recent years, which has been welcome. The closure of the racetrack in Macau - which was called 'a death camp for dogs' and where tens of thousands of greyhounds - including from Australia, have been raced or killed over the last 50 years - has had a big impact. Hundreds of Australian greyhounds have been rescued since the closure of the Canidrome in 2018. Animal advocates, rescue groups and volunteers put their money, compassion and hard work into rescuing and rehabilitating the greyhounds callously discarded by the racing industry, here or overseas. We owe them our gratitude.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With the ongoing investigations into continued exports, we have to do the right thing and draw a line in the sand.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A ban on commercial greyhound export is long overdue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Greyhound export might make a buck for the industry in Australia, but the welfare of the dogs is routinely sacrificed at the altar of profitability and gambling revenue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        No matter what the industry says, neither the welfare of the dogs, nor where they end up, can be guaranteed after they are exported. The only sensible and appropriate measure is to shut down the trade altogether.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        More and more people in Australia see greyhound racing for what it is: gambling-fuelled animal cruelty. These beautiful dogs should be running for fun, not for their lives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My loving and trusting ex-racing greyhound Cosmo, is a reminder to me every single day of the plight of hundreds of dogs enduring the cruelty of racing. I know I have no choice but to keep pushing to end this cruelty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I hope you can all join me in taking one step in stopping animal deaths and cruelty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the bill to the Senate.

        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
