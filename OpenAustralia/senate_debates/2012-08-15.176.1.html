         The WCO reviews the harmonized system every five years to reflect changes in industry practice, technological developments and changes in international trade patterns. The fourth and most recent review of the

          Harmonized System
         </a>
         was completed in June 2010, and came into effect on 1 January 2012. These changes were implemented in Australia as part of the Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Bill 2011, which clarified several tariff lines relating to shark products, and created a new tariff line for shark fins (smoked, salted or dried).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Assessing the potential for a more comprehensive shark trade data collection system to improve shark conservation and management is also an action item in Australia's second National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (Shark Plan 2). Under the plan's operational strategy, DAFF will 'Assess the potential for more comprehensive trade data collection and analysis to improve shark conservation and management outcomes and implement a more comprehensive trade data collection system as appropriate'.

         Australia does not require documentation with every import of seafood that attests to its conformance with the FAO's voluntary guidelines, and forcing compliance with these guidelines would not be consistent with free trade policy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) The government is not currently considering a risk assessment method as a way of identifying species that are not consistent with responsible fish trade.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia assesses imports of fish products based on sanitary and phytosanitary standards, consistent with our obligations under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" rel="nofollow">
          World Trade Organization
         </a>
         , and whether imports comply with relevant measures adopted under those regional fisheries management organisations of which Australia is a member.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) Schemes to track fisheries products from catch to market place can be effective tools in combating illegal fishing. Catch documentation schemes should be appropriately adapted for the particular needs and objectives of the organisation or fishery to which it relates. In Australia's view, the European Union's (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
          EU
         </a>
         ) scheme is not likely to be the most effective system for all fisheries or organisations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Three of the organisations of which Australia is a member use catch documentation schemes to trace or monitor catch of specific fishery resources. This includes the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (southern Bluefin tuna), the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (toothfish) and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (bigeye tuna). A fourth, the Western Central Pacific Fishery Commission, is currently considering the most appropriate objectives and design for catch documentation schemes to monitor certain species.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Furthermore, Australia's market and trade characteristics are distinct from the EU, which is one of the world's largest import markets for fish products. As a result, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU's" rel="nofollow">
          EU's
         </a>
         regulation may not be the most appropriate approach for addressing Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (

Australia will continue to work with regional partners through the Regional Plan of Action (RPOA) to Promote Responsible Fishing Practices Including Combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing in the South East Asia Region and continue efforts under the Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agency to address IUU in the region.

        <p class="italic">
         (9) Clause 9ZO of the Fisheries Management Regulations 1992 stipulates the way fish can be processed before being received by a fish receiver. In respect to sharks the clause states that no caudal lobe, dorsal, pectoral or caudal fin can be removed before being received by a fish receiver.

         has in place a comprehensive intelligence driven, risk based targeted domestic compliance program. Shark finning, along with other matters identified as posing risks to the integrity of AFMA's fisheries management arrangements, are monitored and treated by AFMA as part of its compliance program which includes targeted field inspections. These inspections of vessels and fish receiver premises are conducted based on risk analysis and relevant intelligence information holdings. These inspections monitor compliance levels against all Commonwealth fisheries management arrangements, including the landing and receipt of sharks. Since 2008 AFMA has investigated five specific matters concerning allegations of illegal shark finning.

         (b) Field inspections conducted by AFMA are multi functional and not species specific. Consequently each inspection has the potential to detect illegal shark finning activities. The following table provides the breakdown on the total number of domestic field inspections covering all Commonwealth fisheries by financial year up to 30 June 2012.

         (c) For the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2012 there was one breach recorded in relation to shark finning with the master of one fishing vessel being prosecuted and convicted. In this case the master was fined $4,000 plus court costs.

         (10)(a) The following table details the number of sightings of foreign fishing vessels and the number of illegal fishing vessels apprehended in the Australian Fishing Zone (

The sightings data does not reflect the actual number of illegal boats because it includes multiple sightings of the same vessels made on consecutive surveillance flights, sightings of fishing vessels legitimately transiting the AFZ and sightings of Indonesian sail powered vessels transiting to and from an area of waters inside the AFZ where they are permitted to fish.

         governments. Through the joint authority arrangements, the States/NT have assumed responsibility for day to day management and this includes the enforcement of the relevant State/NT laws under which the fisheries are managed. In the Northern Territory the Police are the responsible agency for the enforcement of NT fisheries laws.

        <p class="italic">
         In other parts of Australia where the Commonwealth has jurisdiction over shark fishing AFMA has imposed a range of measures to address the risk of shark finning. These include the introduction of possession limits on the number of shark carcases which can be carried on board vessels and restrictions on the extent to which processing can be conducted at sea and the form in which fish processors are permitted to receive shark.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         AFMA, through its general deterrence program, conducts targeted inspections of both Commonwealth endorsed fishing vessels and fish receiver premises to monitor compliance levels with a range of Commonwealth fisheries management arrangements (including the landing and receipt of shark carcasses).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Between 2008-09 and 2011-12 AFMA's risk assessment rating associated with shark finning has declined. This is based on data analysis on catch landings and exports, the lack of credible evidence gleaned from investigations conducted into allegations of shark finning, a reduction in intelligence reports and allegations relating to shark finning and the low incidence of matters detected during targeted field operations.
