         I don't have that information to hand. Unsurprisingly, I would have to go and see if there is any information that I can provide to Senator Hanson, which I am happy to. Sometimes, if people give a heads-up when they have a question that is that specific, we can prepare so that we are able to answer in more detail than I can at the moment. I accept there is a level of interest from Senator Hanson, and I am not in a position to answer that today with any information that has been provided to me.

         , the National Indigenous Advancement Strategy, and it may be through other arrangements that you referred to in relation to native title, whether it is through the Attorney-General's portfolio, to support organisations pursuing native title claims. As to the specifics, I would have to come back to Senator Hanson on that, and I will see there is anything I can provide.

           Senator Gallagher, I will help you out there. In the 2022-23 financial year, the Attorney-General's Department abolished the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Title" rel="nofollow">
            Native Title
           </a>
           Respondents Funding Scheme that provided a piddling $7.1 million, while self-indulgent claimants received almost $71 million to pursue already debt ridden councils. Why did the Albanese government all but abolish the funding for one and not the other?

            I'm happy to come back with some information on that. It doesn't actually fall under the portfolio of the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, whom I am representing. For those opposite who are laughing, it is, as I alluded to in my first answer, a matter for the Attorney-General, so I'm not in a position to answer, as I'm not representing that portfolio in this place. I think this was covered at estimates to some degree. I am happy to see whether there's any further information I can provide the chamber. I will ask that the Attorney do that, perhaps through Minister Watt.

              You might be able to answer this one. Fifty per cent of Australia is already under native title, with a further 10 per cent awaiting determination. Minister, at what point will these native title claims end?

               There are processes and laws in this country that presumably will be followed, unless they are changed, and there is no intention on this side to do that. We are looking forward to putting a voice to parliament so that there are opportunities to listen to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                First Nations
               </a>
               Australians and to ensure that we're driving better outcomes across the country. This is something that I think all of us on this side of the chamber are pleased to campaign for, and we look forward, over the next four to five weeks, to that positive campaign which is responding to First Nations people. It is providing recognition in the Constitution and listening about matters that directly affect them to drive better outcomes for First Nations people across this country.
