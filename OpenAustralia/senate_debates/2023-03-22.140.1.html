        exposed a dirty secret report to the National Indigenous Australians Agency that concluded traditional owners in the Beetaloo basin won't benefit economically, socially or culturally from fracking their country. It also stated that the traditional owners are at a clear disadvantage when negotiating with gas giants. How do you justify fracking the Beetaloo after these revelations?

         </a>
         people's connection to their country is central to their spiritual, cultural, physical and economic wellbeing and that native title recognises First Nations people's pre-existing land and water rights and interests. We also recognise the importance of thorough consultation with First Nations people with the cultural authority to speak for country in line with principles of free, prior and informed consent. Land councils have those statutory responsibilities under law to consult with traditional owners and native title holders regarding activities on their traditional land. We are also taking action to ensure that the voices of First Nations people are heard and listened to, as we are through the Voice to parliament.

         Specifically in relation to the Beetaloo basin, the

           Given the clear disadvantage of traditional owners when negotiating with these dirty gas giants and their almost-unanimous opposition to fracking—no free, prior and informed consent, I beg your pardon—will you withhold any fracking in the Beetaloo until and unless genuine consent has been obtained? If you have free, prior and informed consent, show us.

            government through the arrangements they have and through the responsibilities they have via the territory laws, but the federal government remains open to working with any community on any issue where there are concerns. If the standard processes that have been put in place aren't working then of course the government would stand ready, able and willing to engage with them on any issue that they seek to raise.
