       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The terms of reference for the Inquiry were:

        (a) the work undertaken by the AFP's Oil for Food Taskforce;

          The Chair
         </a>
         recommends the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity launch a broad inquiry into the structural, recurrent failings of the AFP to properly investigate and prosecute foreign bribery and corruption and the merits of establishing a specialised agency to investigate and prosecute the commission of white-collar crime by Australian individuals or corporate entities regardless of where the alleged crime took place.

        The Integrity Commissioner, supported by the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), is responsible for investigating corruption issues involving staff members of law enforcement agencies specified in the
        <i>
         Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006

        (

        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the LEIC Act, the Integrity Commissioner is responsible for deciding whether or not to commence a corruption investigation or inquiry. ACLEI, on behalf of the Integrity Commissioner, has advised that there is no indication that an investigation is warranted in the circumstances described.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also established structures to strengthen the Commonwealth's ability to investigate and prosecute corporate offences, particularly fraud and corruption.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example, in July 2014, the Minister for Justice announced the establishment of the AFP-led Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAC" rel="nofollow">
         FAC
        </a>
        Centre). The FAC Centre is focused on the following objectives:

       <ul>

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2014 and 2015, the FAC Centre's multi-agency approach and flexible response model contributed to bringing corruption prosecutions to court. For example:

        ASIC has responsibility for enforcing the majority of Corporations Act provisions, including those providing protection to corporate whistleblowers. To support the implementation of the Corporations Act protections, ASIC has established an Office of the Whistleblower, which will monitor the handling of all whistleblower reports, manage staff development and training and handle the relationship with whistleblowers on more complex matters. The Office builds on improvements that ASIC has made to its whistleblower arrangements by adopting a centralised monitoring procedure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has responsibility for enforcing the whistleblower protections under the Banking Act, Insurance Act, Life Insurance Act and SIS Act. To support this role, APRA has put robust processes in place for handling whistleblower complaints relating to the institutions regulated under those Acts. Information on APRA's policy and process is available on its website: &lt;http://www.apra.gov.au/aboutapra/pages/information-on-being-a-whistleblower.aspx&gt;.
