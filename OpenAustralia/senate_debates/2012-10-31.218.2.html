         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1a. Refer to page 19 of the Broadband, Communications and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
          Digital Economy
         </a>

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1b. Refer to page 18 of the Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements 2011-12.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1c. There were no additional savings announced in the 2012-13 Budget. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Finance Minister
         </a>
         announced additional Departmental savings on 25 September 2012 and DBCDE will meet these.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2. The Department has undertaken some structural change as a result of reduced appropriation funding in 2012-13, which is now estimated to be $111.6 million, compared to $127.5 million in 2011-12. Together with the increase in the efficiency dividend, this funding change comes about as a number of reviews are completed; the Australian Broadband Guarantee program is fully wound-up; one-off funding for some activities related to the development of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         ends; and the digital switchover program expands into metropolitan areas. To address these changes, the department has:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         足developed a new structure based around collapsing some
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
          SES
         </a>
         jobs together, thereby reducing the size of the SES;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         足offered some targeted voluntary redundancies in certain Divisions, where activities have ceased;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         足reviewed a number of expense areas, such as travel, consultants and contractors, to identify savings; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         足reviewed the provision of corporate, legal and financial services of the department, and identified efficiencies in delivering these services to the department.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         3. In 2012-13, employee benefits are projected to be $79.3m, or 66% of total projected expenses.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         4. The Average Staffing Level for the department is projected to be 641 in 2012-13.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         5. Yes. As noted in 2 above, the department has reduced staffing in certain divisions, particularly where activities have ceased, as well as around 20 positions in the corporate, legal and financial service areas.
