        My question is to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy
        </a>
        , Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to a statement by the then shadow communications minister and now Minister for Finance and Deregulation,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Tanner" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Tanner
        </a>
        , in February 2003. The statement read:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … Labor believes that whatever the telecommunications policy merits of full structural separation of Telstra may be, the existence of the minority private shareholding in Telstra and the cost and complexity therefore associated with such separation, make that an inappropriate strategy for reforming Telstra.
       </p>
       <p>
        I ask the minister: is that still Labor Party policy?

         I thank Senator Minchin for his question. The national broadband network will be the biggest national investment in broadband infrastructure ever made by an Australian government. As expected with a project of this magnitude, there has been considerable debate within the industry and media about the regulatory settings and the structural arrangements that should apply to the national broadband network. Far from shying away from this debate, this government has encouraged it.

To quickly recap for those opposite: the government asked the public and all interested parties to put in submissions on the regulatory issues—far from gagging anybody, including participants, from commenting on the regulatory issues. These are a valuable resource on which the expert panel can draw in assessing the

I am sure Senator Conroy will go on to explain further the objectives in the national broadband network proposal. Unfortunately, the opposition seem to have failed to grasp the issue, but I invite them to at least recognise that Senator Conroy is answering the question—

                    There is no point of order. As you know, Senator Minchin, I cannot instruct the minister how to answer the question. I draw the minister’s attention to the question and the minister has one minute and 58 seconds in which to complete his answer.

                     The request for proposals sets out 18 objectives that proponents should address, including open access arrangements to facilitate competition and ensure equivalence of access terms. Section 1.5.16 of the request for proposals states:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     Proponents should submit their proposed arrangements for ensuring open access to the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                      NBN
                     </a>
                     , including measures or models to ensure that access is provided on the equivalent price and non-price terms and conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This section goes on to state:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     If a proponent proposes to supply both wholesale and retail services it should demonstrate what structural measures or models it proposes be put in place and maintained to prevent inappropriate self-preferential treatment and ensure that effective open access is achieved on the terms required by the Commonwealth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The government has no preconceived preference on whether any particular measures or models for open access are better than others. What is important is that the government focuses on objectives such as competition, open access and equivalence. The arrangements put forward by proponents in response to the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFP" rel="nofollow">
                      RFP
                     </a>
                     will be considered by the expert panel, which will provide a report to the government on its recommendations.

                     It is not surprising that some proponents are keen to avoid the competitive tension of the NBN process by seeking to have regulatory options ruled in or out before bids have even been lodged. It is disappointing, however, that the current shadow minister has bought into this public posturing around the NBN process. Senator Minchin’s comments on this process are particularly difficult to understand—

                       As I said, it is very disappointing to see the knee-jerk reaction from the current shadow minister. Senator Minchin’s opposition to this process is particularly difficult to understand in the context of his boast that he sat around the cabinet table for nine years under the previous government dealing with every submission that came forward on this issue. We have taken exactly the same approach on these regulatory settings as the previous government took in its process last year.
