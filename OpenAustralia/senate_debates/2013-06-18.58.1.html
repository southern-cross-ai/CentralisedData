        's fixed-wireless network would serve 700,000 Australians in outer-suburban and regional areas and be finished in 2015. Is it correct that the network has still only reached 17,000 premises? If that is not correct, would the minister inform the Senate just how close to this 700,000 target the wireless rollout is?

         Thank you for the opportunity, Senator Boyce, and congratulations for asking a question on the day that the fixed wireless network has switched on its 25Mbps down and 5Mbps up product—a day when the people who have got access to this now have better speeds than anybody living in a metropolitan city, Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane, if they are using the copper.

          , I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. There were two questions. Firstly, the minister was asked whether it was correct that the network has only reached 17,000 premises. Secondly he was asked, if not, would he inform the Senate how close to the 700,000 target the rollout is. They were the only two questions. Each asked for a figure. What he is saying is not directly relevant or even vaguely relevant to either of those two questions.

            . Unlike Senator Birmingham, the good senator was not at Senate estimates when this very issue was discussed at considerable length. The answer that was given to Senator Birmingham was that it was not going to be possible to be exact, because the number of towers that were being connected was still not fixed as at 30 June and there would not be an accurate answer to that question until after 30 June. As to Senator Boyce's overarching question about when it will be finished, it is still scheduled to be finished in 2015. There are annual targets—

                I do apologise for being distracted by Senator Brandis. The overall build is still on target for completion in 2015. There is no change to that. Getting some towers erected, due to legitimate community concerns, has taken longer than would have been hoped. Some have been appealed to the relevant authorities in different states and some have had extra negotiations but have then resourced different communities. It is slowly but surely working its way through all of those legitimate legal processes.

                 , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the minister is using the end of the financial year as an excuse not to answer the first question, could he please confirm or deny that, after paying $120 million for spectrum licenses in 2011, the wireless rollout has now stalled because

                  It may come as a surprise to you but Optus's ownership and holdings of that spectrum were not a national security issue. They were well known to

                  Co. and well known to the government. At boundaries there are always issues between different networks. That is just the laws of physics. But, as to a suggestion that the rollout has stalled because of such an issue, the answer is a categorical no—absolutely wrong. The rollout is not stalled, firstly, and it is not stalled because of an interference issue at the edges of the two networks.

That followed months of questioning, in this place and elsewhere, about the lack of progress in building Labor's NBN. In light of the debacle and with the benefit of hindsight, can the minister please now rule out needing to downgrade the rollout targets for the fixed wireless network or tell us the facts—which is that it does need downgrading?

There is some overlay between the two: in some areas where towers are built, there may not be a line of sight to some houses. There is not an absolute black and white line in that seven per cent. It is about three per cent-four per cent or four per cent-three per cent. I have said this many, many times. But the seven per cent—unless those opposite, who are vandals, decide to overturn this at some future point, if they were to be surprisingly elected to this country's government—is the seven per cent.
