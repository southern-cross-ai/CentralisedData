        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Kemp. What recent initiatives have been taken by the federal government to promote the development of better family relationships and to encourage early intervention when relationships are at risk?

         I thank Senator Adams for her very important question. This, of course, is part of the continuing interest that Senator Adams has in supporting families, and I acknowledge the work that she does in the Senate in this regard. Over the last 10 years the government has developed policies and initiatives that have developed a very strong economy, which we all know. This has been of great benefit to Australian families. As the economy has grown, the coalition has placed even greater emphasis on providing support for families, developing policies to strengthen family relationships and assisting families in time of need.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are a number of recent initiatives that I would like to bring to the Senate’s attention, particularly in the area of family relationships that Senator Adams raised. The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Brough" rel="nofollow">

         , recently opened applications for a second round of funding under the Family Relationships Services Program. Fourteen million dollars in funding will be provided to establish 27 new family relationship intervention services around Australia. These will provide greater access to family support services. On behalf of Minister Brough, I encourage all eligible organisations to apply for this funding.
        </p>
        <p>
         The program aims to reduce the economic and emotional costs associated with the disruption of family relationships by increasing access to early intervention services, thus helping families to resolve issues before they result in breakdown. Successful organisations will deliver a range of services, including relationship counselling, education and skills training, and men and family relationship services. These services will help families develop and sustain safe and supportive family environments. This will add to the 33 additional early intervention services established in the first funding round, which commenced operations in July 2006. These 27 new service locations confirm the coalition government’s very strong commitment to supporting families by extending support services to provide the community with a greater range of services and, in particular, access to services.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, some senators may be aware that earlier this month Minister Brough and the Attorney-General called for interested organisations to apply to run one of the next 25 family relationship centres. The centres will be the front door for information, advice and other help to people seeking to strengthen family relationships, prevent separation wherever possible and resolve relationship difficulties after separation. These services will open in July 2007 and build on the achievements of the first 15 centres already in operation. The government’s policies will see an expansion in services, including early intervention services such as pre-marriage education, family skills training, additional counselling, mediation and similar services, and children’s contact services.
        </p>
        <p>
         Further, on Monday Minister Brough extended the fifth birthday celebrations of Mensline Australia. Mensline Australia provides 24 relationship counselling and referral services and this service has responded to more than 110,000 calls. Having restored Australia’s economy to a position of really great strength, the coalition will continue to deliver what is needed to support Australian families. I thank Senator Adams for her very important question.
