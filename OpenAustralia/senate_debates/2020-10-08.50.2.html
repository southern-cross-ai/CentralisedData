        In accordance with the resolution just agreed to, I will now put the questions required to dispose of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020 as we are past 12.45. I will first deal with the amendment circulated by the

         The advice from the clerk is that amendment (1) on that sheet now does not need to be put, so I will now deal with the amendments and requests circulated by the government. I understand there's an addendum and there are supplementary explanatory memorandums.

                 Thank you. Let me just deal with a matter before that. Is it the wish of the chamber that the statement of reasons accompanying the circulated requests relating to this bill be incorporated in

                  Hansard
