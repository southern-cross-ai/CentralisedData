        My question is to Senator Conroy, the Minister representing the Treasurer. My question concerns the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        —a tax, I understand, Senator Conroy is very familiar with. In fact Senator Conroy would recall his earlier views on the GST were stated so often in this chamber, when he said it was ‘un-Australian’ and would have a ‘devastating impact’ on small business, working families and pensioners. My question to Senator Conroy is: has he changed his views on the GST and, in particular, would he explain why the GST is not included in the Henry review of taxation?

         Could I take this opportunity to wish Senator Kemp all the best in his—well, ‘retirement’ would not be the right word. No Carlton supporter will ever be able to retire. In terms of the government’s view on the

          GST

           I do remember it. I remember it well. But there has been no suggestion whatsoever that we would be considering any of those issues. That is the very reason we are not going to include it in the Henry review. Henry has a very wide remit, but he is not going to be considering these matters. It is as simple as that.

                I have often said that I try to model my capacity to answer questions on Senator Kemp. I do not think I will ever be as good as him at avoiding an answer. I will never be as good, no matter how long I stay in this chamber. But there will be an emissions trading green paper which will cover all of these issues. It will be an excellent green paper. I am sure that you will welcome it once you have worked out what your party’s position is on it this week. What is the coalition’s position on these issues? You said ‘yes’ before the election; now you are saying ‘no’.
