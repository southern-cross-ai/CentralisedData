           The government does not support this motion, as we consider this proposed committee to be a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Horse" rel="nofollow">
            Trojan Horse

           to implement a sugar tax. The government recognises the importance of tackling obesity and we have two key initiatives: the Healthy Food Partnership to encourage healthy eating; and the Health Star Rating system, a front-of-packet labelling system. As announced in Tuesday's budget, the government will also invest $230 million in sport and physical activity initiatives over five years.
