         The government is taking decisive action to manage the global financial crisis and the inevitable impact that it will have on the domestic economy. Yesterday, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy.

            <p>
             From yesterday we introduced a residential housing sector boost through the first home owners scheme. From yesterday until 30 June 2009 first home buyers who purchase a new home will receive a grant of $21,000, or $14,000 if they purchase an existing home. Housing investment accounts for about six per cent of the Australian economy. It is important that we support this sector in these uncertain economic times.
            </p>
            <p>
             Expanding support for first home buyers through the first home owners boost is right for the conditions we currently face. It will help shore up housing activity in a sector that may otherwise slow. That is why this is a time limited measure that comes into effect immediately. Over the longer term, the government has put in place a strategy to increase the supply of affordable homes and to help young Australians save for a first home. The importance of these measures for ensuring that Australian’s are protected from the global financial crisis is such that these measures will be introduced immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have had extensive discussions with the sector and with public officials in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
              Reserve Bank
             </a>
             and Treasury and with international organisations like the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
              IMF
             </a>
             . We have had extensive conversations right through all the impacts of this and we continue to say this is a necessary and important measure to protect Australians. The first home saver accounts will help young Australians save for their first home. If you are not going to support it, come out and say it—stop nitpicking and come out and say it.

                     , on relevance. If the minister wants bipartisan support on these measures he might actually address the questions we are seriously asking. On this occasion we asked whether or not any modelling has been done. Surely, Mr President, the answer is either yes or no and not this four minutes of obfuscation that we have had to suffer.

                      , on the point of order, Senator Abetz may like to grandstand with points of order but clearly the minister was indicating the advice and the consultations that had taken place in the formation of the package. He was right on the question in terms of his reply. He is not required to say yes or no to a proposition put by the opposition. He is allowed to explain the work that went into the design of the package. He is doing that and I think he ought to be allowed to finish his answer. If the questioner is genuinely interested, the opposition ought to allow the minister to complete his answer.

                        , I ask a supplementary question. The minister does not appear to be aware of any modelling. I wonder, instead, if he might be aware of measures that have been proposed at the state and territory level in Australia to abolish stamp duty as another way of stimulating housing affordability, such as that put forward by the Canberra Liberals for this coming Saturday’s election.
