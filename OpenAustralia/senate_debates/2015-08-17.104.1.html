         Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. We have witnessed Senator Conroy's non-stop sledging throughout this whole debate. Even if he does not want to extend any courtesy to my side of the place, at least he might extend it to his own colleague, Senator O'Neill.

          Senator Conroy has not been the only interjector in this session. I would ask all senators to do two things—that is, not to interrupt other senators speaking and to address their remarks through the chair.

           I am always happy to be assisted by my fine colleague in the Senate, Senator Conroy. But on this occasion, in the time since question time concluded and my return to the chamber, I understand Shakespeare has been somewhat discussed. That is quite interesting because in preparing my remarks, I was thinking about one of the lessons that Shakespeare is often used to teach—that is, to consider the difference between and the similarities of appearance and reality. What we have seen here is a government making every possible effort to encourage Australians to look the other way while they hide the shame of the disgraceful internecine concoctions of relationship that are part of what is the Liberal Party at large in government.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are a royal commissions and there are royal commissions. Australians know there is a very important royal commission that was started under Nicola Roxon's watch into institutional violence against children, a very important matter. Australians have received that royal commission with great interest and have participated in it. Compare and contrast that with this political exercise funded by the Australian taxpayer to the tune of $80 million—at least that is what we think at the moment but it is probably going to end up being more given what has been revealed about the fees today—including the fee of $1.367 million for Michael Elliott, who is assisting. That is his pay for nine months to go out into this so-called royal commission—trying to convey the appearance of being a royal commission—and find as much as they can possibly can and then bring it into the House of Representatives and use that in political questioning and political statements here in this parliament. There are royal commissions and there are royal commissions. The one into institutional violence is absolutely a real one in the tradition that Australians have come to know and respect. The other one is revealing of a disgraceful Liberal Party, who will abuse any of the advantages they have from this high office to help themselves out.
          </p>
          <p>
           What are the Liberal links that have been revealed? While we were in question time today, there was an article filed at 2.22 this afternoon by Heath Aston, who has put on record—and I know there were questions of Mr Abbott—the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship" rel="nofollow">
            Rhodes Scholarship
           </a>
           connection: a personal relationship between Mr Abbott and his hand-picked judge to lead the trade union royal commission dates back decades. This Liberal Party, nearly all of them men, is a perfect example of the boys club and the insider conversations—the 'you look after me and I'll look after you' mentality that is a signature of this government. We have a Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, whose assistance to the Rhodes Scholarship was given by now Commissioner Heydon. Mr Abbott chose and appointed Commissioner Heydon, just as he did

           </a>
           —another captain's pick, and it is coming unstuck because it was done as a favour. While this deception continues, we still have the Attorney-General of Australia standing up trying to tell the Australian people that it was not a fundraiser. Just because they did not make very much money does not mean it was not a fundraiser. It was a pretty bad fundraiser, but it was still a fundraiser, and there may well have been donations.
          </p>
          <p>
           The reality is that, even though they deny it was a fundraiser, the Australian people are on to them. It is not a royal commission; it is a witch-hunt and a political exercise funded by the taxpayer. If it was a fundraiser, it was a fundraiser with no less than a royal commissioner standing up to speak at it. If the commissioner overlooked it, that goes to his character and to failure in his office. Certainly the Liberal Party of

            New South Wales
           </a>
           are a great shame. They continue to ignore, deny and cover up whatever they can with regard to this, but they are responsible for this terrible situation where we have a conflicted and biased commissioner who is now discredited and compromised. He should resign in the interests of the royal commission.
