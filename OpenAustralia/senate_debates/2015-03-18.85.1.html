          This is an important question for agriculture. You should listen up. It shows a record 1.2 million live cattle were exported from Australia in 2014 valued at $1.23 billion. With forecasts from the

          suggesting our live export trade is set to reach at least one million head of cattle in 2015, can the minister outline how a strong live export trade is assisting Australian graziers to recover from recent drought conditions?

           The coalition government unequivocally supports the live export trade. The value of the live export trade including cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats between October 2013 and November 2014 exceeded $1.6 billion. That means that a greater return to our primary producers is this government's core priority and that is something that is happening as we speak. What is also often disregarded is that this trade contributes to the food security of millions of people in importing countries across the world, particularly in markets where there is a strong cultural preference for freshly slaughtered meat. Added to this, Australia's leadership in the trade has provided significant opportunity to positively influence animal welfare conditions in these countries and continues to do so. We can be proud that under the exporter supply chain assurance scheme, ESCAS, animal welfare outcomes have improved not only for Australian exported livestock but also domestic livestock and those sourced from other countries.
          </p>
          <p>
           The live export industry generates employment for around 10,000 people including in ancillary industries such as transport, veterinary and feedlot services. The live cattle trade also provides employment opportunities for Indigenous people in Northern Australia's live export region. On top of this, the industry has provided training to more than 7,000 people working in the supply chains in Asia and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
            Middle East
           </a>
           including managers and animal welfare officers who help improve animal handling and husbandry techniques. The increased use of stunning equipment has become active and respected through trade diplomacy.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government have also committed to relieving the red tape burden for the industry under ESCAS. We will not be reducing our assurance on animal welfare but what we will be doing is removing duplication, rework and unnecessary bureaucracy. These practical changes are designed to make live export processes faster and more cost-effective.

             I must reiterate that from the combined efforts between government and industry including extensive work to reopen and improve market access, over 1.6 million head of cattle have been exported since this government came to office in October 2013. In 2014 the government successfully negotiated access to six livestock export markets: Egypt, Bahrain, Iran, Cambodia, Thailand and Lebanon. I am hoping that the Minister for Agriculture will soon be announcing access to China. This proves the coalition government's commitment to live export trade and further proves this government's commitment to Australia's primary producers. It is further evidenced by the fact that under the final month of the previous government a price of a light steer out of Darwin was 165c a kilo. As of 5 March this year, the same animal made 275c a kilo—a massive 67 per cent increase in returns through the farm gate.

                 As evidenced in the recently released report into the performance of ESCAS, more than 99 per cent of Australian livestock was exported without reported incident. Out of the 8,035,633 livestock exported from Australia since the system was introduced in 2011 until 30 November 2014, there have been just 12,958 animals, or 0.16 per cent of the total, where there was a potential adverse animal outcome.
