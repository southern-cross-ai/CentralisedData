        People in custody have a right to culturally safe and equitable healthcare services. They should be leaving prison in better health than when they entered the system, but the opposite is the case, as they are denied crucial healthcare services. The current system is failing.

       <p>
        Unnatural deaths in custody continue to occur at shamefully higher rates than in the community—many of them, resulting from preventable health issues. Just this week there has been another Aboriginal death in

        , social and emotional wellbeing services, drug and alcohol support and sexual and reproductive health services for women, trans and gender-diverse people. We need mechanisms for routine and independent assessment of prison health care and proper oversight of prison operations, including implementing the national preventive mechanisms under
