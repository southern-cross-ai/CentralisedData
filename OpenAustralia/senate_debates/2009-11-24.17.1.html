        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Senator Carr. I draw the minister’s attention to Mr Rudd’s campaign launch speech, where he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … if elected, Federal Labor will undertake a ground-breaking reform by providing for every Australian secondary school student in years nine to 12 with access to their own computer at school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the Prime Minister’s commitment to deliver one million computers and the fact that, two years on, only 15 per cent have been delivered, will the minister now admit this is yet another Rudd government broken promise?

          Senator Mason has done a valiant job to try to arouse some interest in this matter, but once again I am afraid he has relied on the

            The Rudd Labor government is investing over $2.2 billion over six years in the Digital Education Revolution. Two point one billion dollars is directed to the National Secondary School Computer Fund, including $807 million for on-costs associated with the deployment of additional computers. To date the fund has approved over 475,000 additional computers in secondary schools. Already 178,000 computers have been delivered to almost 1,900 schools across Australia. I repeat that: 178,000 computers have been delivered to almost 1,900 schools across Australia. If Senator Mason thinks that a commitment to invest $2.2 billion over six years is some small matter then I suggest he spend more time in the party room, because he is obviously running the numbers against Mr Turnbull. Two point one billion dollars is in fact directed towards the National Secondary School Computer Fund, and I repeat that it includes $807 million for the on-costs associated with computers.

                All secondary schools in Australia have been given the opportunity to obtain funding to bring them up to a one to two computer to student ratio. This is the first time in Australia’s history that this sort of investment has been made by an Australian government.

Given that the program has already required an additional $800 million and is still progressing at a snail’s pace, will the minister admit that this is yet another Rudd government broken promise on education?

                       Senator Mason means well. Unfortunately, he has relied upon some misinformation. I just have to remind him yet again that the Commonwealth—the Rudd Labor government—is providing some $2.1 billion to the National Secondary School Computer Fund.

                         Two point one billion dollars, Senator Conroy. To date, funding has been approved for over 475,000 additional computers for secondary schools, and over 178,000 computers have been delivered to 1,900 schools across Australia. How Senator Mason can suggest that this is a broken promise is a little beyond me. I am a little puzzled. This is a government that is investing $2.2 billion over six years in the Digital Education Revolution. We are providing assistance to schools to ensure that schools move to a ratio of one—

                            With regard to high-speed broadband to schools, $100 million has been invested to support the deployment of high-speed broadband connections to schools across Australia. High-speed broadband is of course the foundation on which information technology can be integrated into our schools, making a new approach to learning and teaching possible. If we have a little bit more assistance from the opposition with regard to the rollout of the broadband network, I am sure that we will be able to make even further progress on what is a magnificent achievement by this government, a magnificent initiative that is being directed by this government, and that we will be able to provide a learning environment that students have not seen ever in the history of the Commonwealth.
