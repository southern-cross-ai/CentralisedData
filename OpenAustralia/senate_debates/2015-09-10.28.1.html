           The government agrees with much of this motion. Suicide is an incredibly serious issue and one that both sides of politics should take seriously, particularly on a day like today when we acknowledge the devastating impact that suicide has on families and communities. But this motion does not seem to be entirely about acknowledging the seven people who commit suicide in Australia every day. It does not seem to be entirely about reflecting on the fact that suicide is the leading cause of death for people between 15 and 44 years of age. There is an element that is about seeking to score points. We on this side of the chamber do not think that that is appropriate. Obviously we will be supporting Senator Lazarus's motion later.

              You are right, Senator Fifield. This motion is not only about acknowledging that seven people die by suicide every day in Australia. It is not only about the fact that 2,500 people die by suicide every year in Australia. It is asking the government to do something about that. This government took one year to do a review of mental health services in Australia, then sat on a report from 1 December last year until 26 April this year and only released that report because it was leaked. The opposition, the community and people living with mental illness are calling on this government to act to ensure that mental health services in Australia will limit the number of people who commit suicide every year in our country. Yes, you are right, Minister—we are asking the government to do something.

               Thank you, Senator McLucas. I again remind senators that statements by leave to motions during discovery of formal business should not amount to a de facto debate on the question before the chair. I am just reminding all senators from both sides to that effect, not anyone in particular.
