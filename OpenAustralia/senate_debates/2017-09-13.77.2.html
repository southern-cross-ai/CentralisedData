        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Yesterday, when asked to confirm that the average Sydney household is paying $1,000 more on their energy bills since this federal Liberal government came to power, the minister refused to answer. Given that the minister has had 24 hours to check, can he now confirm that the average Sydney household is paying $1,000 more for electricity since this federal Liberal government came to power?

         That's just not true. I didn't refuse to answer the question at all. In fact, I gave you a very full answer, Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAllister" rel="nofollow">
          McAllister
         </a>
         . I didn't confirm the assertion you made then and I don't confirm it now. But, because you raised the issue of electricity prices, I can tell you, as I tried to tell you yesterday, what the Australian government is doing to ensure that there is downward pressure on electricity prices. First of all, Senator McAllister, we won't be repeating the mistake that you made—not you personally, of course; I don't think you were in the Senate at the time. We won't be repeating the mistake that your side of politics made of allowing unregulated export from the Australian gas market so that overseas consumers were able to buy Australian gas at lower prices than Australian consumers. We won't be repeating that mistake, which is why the Prime Minister and the minister for energy, Mr Frydenberg, on 24 July announced the new mechanism that will enable them to regulate the export of gas.
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondly, Senator McAllister, we have also taken action to ensure that electricity providers are transparent with their customers by making available to all electricity consumers a mechanism whereby they can easily and readily establish the best available plan for them on their electricity bill. That is something which was the direct result of the Prime Minister's own personal intervention with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

         Senator Wong, let me take your interjection. It was a very productive cup of tea, Senator Wong, because it resulted in millions of Australians being put in a position to reduce their electricity bill as a result of the Prime Minister's intervention.

            Not only will I not admit it, but it's objectively wrong. In fact, we had the largest reduction in Australian retail power prices early in the life of this government when we abolished the carbon tax, imposed by the last Labor government. We saw the single greatest reduction in electricity prices in recent Australian history. Senator
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAllister" rel="nofollow">

            </a>
            , frustrate as you do, play politics as you do, but you and your side are standing in the way of further reductions of power prices to Australians by getting in the way of the government legislating to abolish the limited merits review so that electricity retailers and suppliers can no longer game the system. The estimates of the savings to Australian consumers from the abolition or the prohibition of suppliers gaming the system is $3.5 billion, and you're standing in the way of those savings.

              Given that the Liberal government has been in power for five years, isn't it clear that the policy paralysis under the Turnbull government is delivering higher energy prices, less investment and less reliability? When will the Prime Minister stand up to his party room and take action to end the energy crisis?
