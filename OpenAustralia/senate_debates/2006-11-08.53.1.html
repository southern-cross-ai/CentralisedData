        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Given that a Newspoll survey earlier this year found that 77 per cent of Australians supported self-determination for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua" rel="nofollow">
         West Papua
        </a>
        , including independence, what actions will the federal government be required to take against the people who support self-determination in West Papua as a result of the new security treaty with Indonesia? Can the minister answer specifically in relation to politicians, journalists working for public broadcasters, public institutions and public servants how the government will be required to take action on their activities in supporting self-determination? Finally, have the Indonesians indicated the kinds of actions that constitute secessionist campaigns that the government is required to act on under the treaty?

         I think Senator Nettle is referring to the announcement that negotiations on a treaty level Australia-Indonesia agreement on the framework for security cooperation have concluded. Mr Downer has announced that he will travel to Lombok on 13 November to sign that agreement with his Indonesian counterpart. We are delighted that such an agreement has been able to be reached with our near neighbour, Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that the Greens have raised the question of Papuan independence. I reiterate in this Senate that the treaty does not in any way infringe or seek to infringe on the rights to freedom of expression or freedom of association. The treaty provides that Australia and Indonesia, as governments, will not support or participate in ‘activities by any person or entity which constitute a threat to the stability, sovereignty or territorial integrity of the other’.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is quite proper and sensible that we have a treaty level commitment with Indonesia under which each party respects the other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We think that is perfectly sensible and proper. That includes, of course, recognition of Indonesia’s sovereignty over Papua. That has been a longstanding policy of successive Australian governments of both political persuasions. It is not the case that the Australian government is going to seek to contribute to or seek to foment any sort of secessionist movement or the break-up of Indonesia. That would not be in Australia’s national interest whatsoever and is not something we as a state should advocate.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, I reiterate, and I guess this goes to the point of Senator Nettle’s question, that this treaty, which as I say will be signed on Monday—and a very good one it is—will not infringe in any way on the rights to freedom of expression or freedom of association of Australians. I am sure both major parties—the government and the alternative government—are very committed to ensuring the appropriate freedoms of expression for Australians to voice their concerns and opinions. The treaty essentially reiterates what has been a longstanding government policy on both sides—that is, that we respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Indonesia.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister able to provide any more detail about what impact the treaty will have for Australia, particularly for any government institutions, such as universities, that may be involved in activities with the independence movement in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua" rel="nofollow">
           West Papua
          </a>
          ? Also, given reports that over 100,000 West Papuans have been killed at the hands of Indonesian authorities, what has the Australian government put into this security treaty to ensure that these killings do not continue? Has the Australian government put anything into this security treaty to deal with any human rights abuses that may occur in Indonesia?

           This is, as I said, an Australia-Indonesia agreement on a framework for security cooperation. That is a great achievement on the part of this government. We will continue to urge the Indonesian government to investigate allegations of human rights abuses and to ensure that the human rights of all Indonesians are respected. We understand that the Indonesian authorities, including the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            National Human Rights Commission
           </a>
           , are investigating recent violent incidents and Australian embassy officials continue to raise these allegations with relevant authorities as they arise. We also strongly support the development of Papua as a stable and prosperous part of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
            Republic of Indonesia
           </a>
           and that is best done through the full and effective implementation of special autonomy and respect for human rights. We as a government do not support separatism; we respect Indonesia’s territorial integrity, including their sovereignty over Papua.
