        () (): It's the final week in the Australian parliament in 2023, just a few weeks from Christmas, and what have we learnt? We've learnt that 2023 is going to be the warmest year on record after nearly a decade of broken weather records on land and on sea. We've seen the warmest ocean temperatures ever recorded in history around the globe. Consequently, we've seen the lowest levels of sea ice in the Antarctic. And what do we find at the end of the year with global climate talks and

        28? We find the president of COP28 making clear claims of climate denial. Why the hell would we hold climate talks in a petrostate? COP28 president Al Jaber was reported as having said that there is 'no science' indicating that a phase-out of fossil fuels is needed to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees. He also said that a phase-out of fossil fuels would not allow sustainable development unless you want to take the world 'back into the caves'. That is clearly, patently false. There is very clear science saying we need to rapidly phase-out fossil fuels. It's not just in the

        ; it's also here in Australia. In Australia this year, we have approved new fossil fuel projects, four new coalmines and new, massive offshore oil and gas exploration projects. Right now, we have 22 billion tonnes of carbon projects up for approval. That is 10 times our current carbon budget out to 2030 and 14 per cent of global emissions. I say to those Australians who want climate action: keep fighting.
