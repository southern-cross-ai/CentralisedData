        has admitted that mine workers who are employed as casuals by labour hire companies are paid, on average, 24 per cent less then permanent employees of the mine operator. Does the Deputy Prime Minister support labour hire being used to undermine the pay of mine workers in regional Australia?

         On behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister, I will say that what we do support is ongoing investment in a sustainable, responsible and economically viable minerals industry so that workers in the resources industry, not just across

           On relevance: it's very clear that the minister is not going remotely go close to answering the question, which was—if I can remind you—about whether the Deputy Prime Minister supports labour hire being used to undermine the pay of mine workers in regional Australia.

             I didn't forget your question. I was just reiterating the National Party's and the Liberal Party's commitment to a sustainable resources sector to ensure that these workers are absolutely being employed. And I'm just wondering whether, post next election—if you're planning to be in alliance and coalition with the Greens—you will actually hold the same views and whether the workers you purport to represent and stand up for in this place will actually be looking to you and asking: 'Why didn't you stand up for us? Why didn't you back a coal industry? Why didn't you back a gas industry?' These guys want to shut everything down. If it has the word 'fossil' in it—

                   Thank you. The government believes in a workplace relations system that promotes fair, safe, harmonious and productive workplaces, that encourages employers and employees to work together—not a system that pits them against each other. When it comes to labour hire, specifically, which is a proportion of all employees, it has been stable at less than two per cent over the last decade. Of the nearly 13 million employed Australians, fewer than 115,000 were employees paid by labour hire firms. That is only 1.1 per cent of all employees. The record high of 1.5 per cent was recorded under a previous Labor government in both 2008—

                     Deputy Prime Minister Joyce refused to answer a question about the impact of same job, same pay in regional Australia last week, handballing it to Minister Fletcher, who claimed: 'This so-called same job, same pay issue is essentially a made-up issue.' Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree with Mr Fletcher that same job, same pay is 'a made-up issue'?

                      I assume that Senator Ayres is referring to his bill, and what I'm wanting to put on the table is what the government's view is around labour hire companies. My advice is that almost all labour hire companies use enterprise agreements that are signed off and by the CFMMEU. We support as a government an industrial relations system. The government doesn't set the wages; that's a negotiated outcome between workers.

I've been directly relevant to the question, in both my first answer and in my second. In terms of helping our nation recover from COVID-19—

                               It's not remotely relevant. Each of these questions is constructed, as you indicated earlier, quite narrowly. The question was: 'Does the Deputy Prime Minister believe that two mine workers, working side by side, doing the same job should get the same pay?' and she hasn't come close to beginning answering that question.
