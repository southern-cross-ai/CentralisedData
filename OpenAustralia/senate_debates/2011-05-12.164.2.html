        Order 38(7), I present to you an interim report of the Economics References Committee in relation to the Committee's inquiry into the impacts of supermarket price decisions on the dairy industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The matter was referred to the Committee on 10 February 2011 for report by 15 April 2011. To date, the Committee has received 151 subm­issions and has held public hearings in Melbourne (8 March 2011), Sydney (9 March 2011) and Canberra (10 and 29 March 2011). To enable the Committee to consider the significant amount of information received, the Committee sought an extension of its reporting date to 20 April 2011, which the Senate approved on 21 March 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        is aware that the inquiry has generated considerable interest and understands that many parties are awaiting the release of the report. It is also aware, however, of the need to balance timeliness with the quality of the analysis. Many of the issues which are the subject of this inquiry require ongoing scrutiny. There are complex interactions between farmers, processors and retailers; and short-term effects may differ significantly from medium-term effects. In particular, the Committee believes the impact of the reductions in retail milk prices depends crucially on how long they are in place, and the extent to which they are reflected in upcoming contract renegotiations with processors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Additionally, the Committee, and many individuals and organisations who participated in this inquiry, are aware that the Government has not provided a response to the report of its previous inquiry, Milking it for all it's worth—competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry. This comprehensive report was tabled on 13 May 2010 and made 16 recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee also only received Coles' responses to their questions on notice in the afternoon of 19 April 2011. This has meant that the Committee has not had sufficient opportunity to consider this new information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consequently, the Committee has decided to present a further interim report before 10 May 2011, which will analyse the evidence that the Committee has received and invite responses and/or further information to be provided. The Committee will then collect and assess further information and examine developments in the dairy industry as they occur to inform its final report, which will be tabled by 1 October 2011.

        The Government notes Recommendation 1.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While it is good practice for Ministers to table annual reports as soon as practicable after receipt of reports from agencies, unless it is otherwise specified in legislation, it remains the Government's policy that all annual reports should be tabled by 31 October.

In any other case, the Commonwealth company must provide its responsible Minister with its annual report four months after the end of the financial year
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Paragraph 9(2)(b) and subsection 36(1A) of the CAC Act also provide that an annual report for a Commonwealth authority and a Commonwealth company respectively, may be given to the responsible Minister at the end of such further period granted by the Minister under subsection 34C(5) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.

       <p class="italic">
        The time taken for a report to be tabled in Parliament, once it is received by the responsible Minister, is determined by subsection 34C(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. That is, the Minister must table the annual report in both

        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that all departments and agencies include a compliance index in future reports.

       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports recommendation 2 and has implemented the recommendation for agencies that are subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Those agencies must prepare their annual report in accordance with the requirements set out in the Requirements for Annual Reports. Compliance indexes were listed as a mandatory

       <p class="italic">
        requirement when that document was reissued in June 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The inclusion of a compliance index in the annual reports of Commonwealth authorities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies under the CAC Act is also supported. The

        will consult departments of State and agencies on the issue of including an index of reporting requirements in future annual reports.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that agencies adhere to the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines by including a signed statement by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        or agency head certifying that they are satisfied that their agency is in compliance with the guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes Recommendation 3.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This proposal is already covered by other arrangements for FMA Act agencies and for Commonwealth authorities or wholly-owned Commonwealth companies that may be subject to the requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Fraud and Control Guidelines apply to all agencies that are subject to the FMA Act and the reporting requirements of FMA Act agency heads, as specified in the Commonwealth Fraud and Control Guidelines, are noted in the Requirements for Annual Reports. Agencies are responsible for ensuring that they are compliant with those requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Prior to 1 July 2008, where a Commonwealth authority or wholly-owned Commonwealth company received a notification under sections 28 or 43 of the CAC Act, respectively, to apply a policy such as the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines the body must comply with the reporting requirements in the policy. A Commonwealth authority that must comply with the policy must also, in accordance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Report of Operations) Orders 2008, report instances of non-compliance with the policy in their annual report. Since 1 July 2008, the process for applying Commonwealth policies to Commonwealth authorities or wholly-owned Commonwealth companies has changed and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commonwealth policies are now applied through general policies orders. To date, no such orders have been issued, however the Department of Finance and Deregulation is in discussion with a number of agencies, including the Attorney-General's Department, to identify Commonwealth policies, such as the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines, to apply to CAC Act bodies a general policy order.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 bodies consider adhering to the Requirements for Annual Reports issued by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
         Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not support Recommendation 4. There are separate annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consistent with section 9 of the CAC Act, the annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth authorities are set out in Schedule 1 of the CAC Act, which includes preparing a report in accordance with the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Report of Operation Orders) 2008. These were issued by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Finance Minister
        </a>
        and commenced on 30 June 2008 and therefore were compulsory for 2008-09 reports, due on 15 October 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In accordance with section 36 of the CAC Act, the annual reporting requirements for Commonwealth companies are set out in two places. First, base requirements are set out in the Corporations Act 2001.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Second, as of 1 July 2008, the Finance Minister may make orders for wholly-owned Commonwealth companies. As explained in the explanatory memorandum to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Amendment Bill 2008, this allows for the Finance Minister to require the reporting of matters in addition to those required by the Corporations Act 2001 "that are appropriate to be included in [Commonwealth companies] annual reports with a view to ensuring consistent reporting of public sector governance and accountability obligations".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Orders relating to wholly-owned Common­wealth companies, similar to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies (Report of Operation Orders) 2008 for Commonwealth authorities, are being prepared for consideration by the Finance Minister.

        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In light of the committee's experience and its concerns with sections of the Guidelines dealing with witnesses appearing in their private capacity, the committee recommends that the Senate refer this matter, as it relates to the Guidelines, to the Standing Committee of Privileges for its consideration.

       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        referred the Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees and Related Matters to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges for inquiry on 21 March 2011. The Government is willing to engage with the Privileges Committee in this activity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All legal officers in Defence Legal and senior officers in the Ministerial and Executive Support Branch undertake a study of the principles governing the operations of Parliament and of the accountability of government departments and agencies to Parliament. Further, that in future such a course of study be mandatory for newcomers to these branches.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government respects the basis for this recommendation and agrees that officers in Defence's Ministerial and Executive Support Branch and legal officers in the Defence Legal Division who support the department's involvement with the parliament should have a very sound grasp of the operations and responsibility of the parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Indeed, the committee may be interested to note that for a number of years Defence has allocated significant resources to develop and conduct a range of tailored in-house training courses for personnel. A number of these courses are focused on educating staff on the specific issues raised in this recommendation. There is consistently high demand for these courses and 1,677 Defence personnel in 2009 received the benefit of this training.

        Additionally, in 2007 Defence introduced the mandatory Working with Government course for all

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the Government does not consider mandating officials from the two specific areas of Defence highlighted in this recommendation to attend such courses to be necessary. Since only a relatively small proportion of officials in these areas are engaged directly in supporting the organisation's interaction with the parliament, mandating such training for all staff would not be an appropriate allocation of resources. But, opportunities will be examined to enhance the training and awareness on parliamentary processes and accountability, and the mechanisms to achieve this across all levels in these areas (both for public servants and military personnel).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that there is also a range of externally provided courses that address the issues identified in this recommendation, including the Senate's own comprehensive education and training program. The Government encourages departments and agencies to consider these types of courses and provide opportunities for staff to attend if they meet their training needs.

        Recommendation 3 NOT ACCEPTED
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4.25 The committee recommends that in the event of an import request by the Philippines government or a Philippines import proponent, a formal and structured process be established by the Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine to provide Australian banana growers with meaningful consultation in relation to the assessment of the efficacy of the possible risk management measures and, consequently, the determination of the risk management measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not accept Recommendations 2 and 3 as the information contained in any potential operational plan is government-to-government communication and is considered confidential and the release of such information without the consent of the other party may have an adverse impact on Australia's broad bilateral relationship with the Philippines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also notes that considerable consultation occurred with all stakeholders on all aspects of the IRA, including the Australian banana industry, as part of the formal, broad-ranging stakeholder consultation process undertaken during the independent, science based, IRA process. The independent IRA process also includes an independent review mechanism of how stakeholder comments have been addressed and an independent appeal process. Information provided by industry and by other relevant stakeholders through this process forms part of the material that is available to AQIS in developing the potential operational plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's Minister for Agriculture established a policy framework in relation to the release of detailed operational plans in relation to the importation of material into Australia. The policy framework includes that negotiation of operational plans remains confidential, as they are government-to-government communications for the entire negotiation period and until the document is finalised in order to protect the interests of both parties and encourage open communication. Operational import plans are the property of the exporting country. Therefore, the agreement of the exporting country will need to be obtained before any information contained in the operational import plans is disclosed. This process is designed to respect the integrity of government-to-government communications and relationships, and to provide consistent treatment for trading partners. Furthermore, Australia is obliged to protect the confidentiality of information relating to the production and handling of an imported product under Annex C (1) (d) of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">

        Agreement, as well as protect commercial-in-confidence information which may be included in an operational import plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, maintaining government-to-government confidentially during the entire period of the negotiation of operational import plans is important for demonstrating to trading partners that Australia's quarantine process is based on sound science and free from industry or political influence.

        Recommendation 4 ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4.26 The committee recommends that, in the event of the issue of an import permit, representatives of the Australian banana industry are promptly notified of that fact, excluding information which is commercial-in-confidence.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, taking into consideration the principles of both the privacy and freedom of information legislation.

       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry undertakes to advise the Australian banana industry if an import permit were issued for the importation of mature hard green banana fruit from the Philippines taking into account the commercial confidentiality rights of the permit holder.

        Recommendation 5 ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4.27 The committee recommends that the Senate order Biosecurity Australia and AQIS to undertake a review of the import requirements for bananas from the Philippines after the first year of trade and to provide a report of this review to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government accepts this recommendation in principle, noting that this IRA report and all other IRA reports include a review mechanism. A review of the import requirements will be undertaken if commercial trade occurs for at least twelve months. The review would form the basis of a report for the Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following significant trade AQIS and Biosecurity Australia routinely undertake reviews of import requirements to ensure that agreed procedures and protocols are meeting Australia's requirements and achieving Australia's appropriate level of protection.

        2009 that the further modernisation of the IMF ' s governance, including the balance of voting power, is a core element in the effort to improve the IMF ' s credibility, legitimacy and effectiveness. The Government played an active role, including by co-chairing the relevant G20 Working Group, in the agreement on the third stage of IMF governance reform reached by G20 Finance Ministers and the IMF Board of Governors in late 2010. This agreement includes a doubling of IMF quotas and further shifts in voting power to dynamic emerging market and developing countries, and from over- to under-represented countries, both of almost 6 per cent. It also includes a more representative IMF Executive Board with advanced European countries agreeing to reduce their representation in favour of emerging market and developing countries.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's voting share is set to decline from 1.47 per cent of the votes to 1.31 per cent of the votes. Far from marginal, this decline in voting share of 0.16 per cent of votes signs away 11 percent of our current vote share.

        Response to Dissenting report:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted in the National Interest Analysis provided to the Committee, IMF quota and voice reform — including the increase in basic votes provided for in the IMF Voice and Participation Amendment — results in a decline in Australia's relative voting share in the IMF. This reflects an increase in relative voting share provided to under-represented emerging market economies, including in our region, and the increase in basic votes benefitting small and low-income members. However, the 2010 agreement will moderate the decline in Australia's voting share, resulting in a share of 1.33 per cent of total votes compared with 1.31 per cent following the 2008 Voice and Participation Amendment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reform in this area has had bipartisan support in Australia. The first stage of reform was agreed by IMF Governors in September 2006 while the second stage was developed in 2007 and early 2008, and agreed by IMF Governors in April 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers that the Amendment and related quota reforms are an important mechanism for enhancing the legitimacy of the IMF as an international financial institution with near-universal membership. A strong and effective IMF advances Australia's interests by supporting stability in the global economy.

The IMF Executive Board is expected to consider rules and regulations in the first half of 2011.

        decisions to invest in arms or military equip­ment or environmentally damaging industries are highly unlikely, inadvertent investment may occur through the IMF's proposed use of a passive investment approach, involving the close tracking of widely used benchmark indices. Restrictions on such investments may need to await the further development of investment methodologies and market practice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will seek comments on the issue from IMF staff in the context of the forthcoming IMF work on rules and regulations governing IMF investments.

        The Coalition is concerned that recommendation 6 does not provide sufficient definition as to what constitutes 'high risk', 'arms or military equipment' or 'environmentally damaging'. Without clear definitions of these terms it is possible that legitimate investments could be thwarted by an overly wide or indiscriminate reading of these terms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the Australian Government were to advocate for the proscriptions outlined in recommendation 6 we risk creating an overly prescriptive regime for the IMF to operate within and may unnecessarily impede the IMF's ability to respond in the best interests of all countries concerned.
