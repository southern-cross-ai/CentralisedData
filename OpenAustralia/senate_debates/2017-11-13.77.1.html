        . I add my congratulations to you on your election today. My question is to Senator Cash, the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Australian government is working to combat the scourge of people-smuggling?

          The continual noise will merely chew up time in question time. Can we give the minister an opportunity to address the question before the vigorous debate of question time leads to interjections?

           Thank you. As I was saying, we have stopped the boats and we have secured our nation's borders, because, as we know, the first priority of the Commonwealth government needs to be maintaining national security, and we have smashed the people smugglers' model. But this has only occurred because the—

               The only reason we have been able to stop the boats, and for so long now, is that we have stood firm and implemented strong border protection policies. When those on the other side were saying you could not turn the boats around, what did we do? We did exactly that, despite the fact that they fought us every step of the way. We introduced temporary protection visas, again something that Labor and the Greens fought tooth and nail against. It is very, very obvious, given, in particular, what we have seen today, that if those opposite ever form government again this is what will happen, as it did before: 50,000 people arrived on in excess of 800 boats. There were 1,200 deaths at sea, that we know of—

                   As I was saying, there were over 8,000 children in detention. They were detained by Labor when they were in government. I remind the chamber that at the height of Labor's policy failure in July 2013, there were 1,992 children in detention. As a result of the flood of people coming here illegally, those on the other side had to open 17 detention centres. There is a reason you have to stand firm. If you don't, you capitulate to the people smugglers.

                        You have made several rulings now in relation to this matter of disrespect that those opposite are showing both to the chair and to the minister. I'm one row behind the minister, and I cannot see. There are many other opportunities for these debating points for the minister. I would ask that the minister be heard in silence.
