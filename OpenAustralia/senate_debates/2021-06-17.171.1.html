        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, Senator Ruston. In recent days, the Morrison government has announced significant changes to the working holiday maker scheme and arrangements for foreign workers. The United Kingdom's Department for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Sheldon for his question. Given the information that has just been provided to the chamber by Senator Birmingham, I think we should all be delighting in the fact that we are seeing more Australians back in work than before the pandemic. And we should all be celebrating the fact that we have an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent today. Who would have thought, when we went into the pandemic, that the economic recovery in this country was going to be so strong as to see 5.1 per cent unemployment in Australia? In the home state of Senator Cash, who's sitting next to me, it's down to 4.4 per cent, which is getting very, very close to full employment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Making sure that we provide a balance, and ensuring that Australians who wish to get into the workforce are able to take that opportunity, is a very important platform of the Morrison-

          McCormack
         </a>
         government's economic policy. We want to see every single Australian who is able to work, in work. That's why we have put in place so many programs, particularly in recent times as we come out of the COVID pandemic. Through JobMaker we've got skilling and retraining programs to make sure that Australians who find themselves without work have a pathway back into the workforce. But we also hear—on the other side of the equation—that there are businesses that are struggling to get employees, and we need to make sure that we provide them with a pool of resources so that they can get workers. That in no way denies that our absolute fundamental policy position of this government is to make sure that Australians who are unemployed—

           The question of relevance—the question was quite specific from Senator Sheldon. The British government has said that Aussie firms will no longer have to prioritise hiring Australian nationals first. The minister hasn't addressed the question: why is the government giving away Australian jobs?

            Senator Keneally, the latter part of your point of order there means that while the minister is talking about the matters that she is, it is quite a wide-ranging part of the question at the end of what Senator Sheldon asked. I think while the minister is talking about—Senator Wong?

                The minister is talking about prioritising jobs for Australians. I'll just finish my explanation and people can take issue with it. I view that question as giving the minister some latitude to answer and to challenge it, and to explain why they are doing the opposite. As long as it's not a general commentary on the unemployment or employment market—if the minister is talking about why they disagree with that question, or talking about prioritising in government policy, I think that's relevant.

                       I hadn't actually stood to make a point again. My point is, if you read it that broadly,

                       , with all due respect, the minister can do precisely what she is doing, which is to engage in motherhood statements. 'We all will prioritise Australian jobs.' It's unsurprising that you are then going to get a response from the opposition seeking to table documents. Direct relevance means dealing with the issue at hand. Just because something says 'jobs', it doesn't mean a minister can stand up and answer a question by saying, 'We all love jobs.'

                        Order! I'm happy to rule. I've taken submissions. I'm not complaining about the opposition objecting to the nature of a question, Senator Wong. I've allowed the opposition to restate and to emphasise the part of the question and to take points of order. I was just pointing out to Senator Keneally that I was corrected by the clerk. I wasn't aware that you couldn't interrupt to seek leave. That was something I learnt. When it comes to the point of order, I can only deal with questions the way that they are asked. I submit, Senator Wong, that you are asking me to go to the content of a minister's answer and how they might answer a question rather than whether they are directly relevant. When a question is 'why is the government'—if I read it correctly—'taking away jobs from Australians in favour of someone else' the minister is entitled to say otherwise, as long as it's not a general commentary on unemployment or employment. I think when the minister was talking about that bit, when the point of order was raised, that constitutes direct relevance. There is an opportunity to debate the content and answers after question time and whether or not the chamber thinks the content of those answers is sufficient or satisfactory. Senator Ruston.

                             Thank you. Yesterday when announcing the new agriculture visa, Minister Littleproud said: 'I'll mirror the existing Seasonal Worker Program. It is really an extension of the working holiday scheme.' Given these are entirely different standards and requirements between these programs, which is it?

                              Well, both of the programs to which Senator Sheldon refers are very, very important programs to support Australia's agricultural sector. In announcing yesterday the agreement that we're putting in place with our

                              friends, to make sure that we are able to support Australian farmers, who are often looking for labour and unable to fill their labour shortages in Australia, I think it is an exceptional initiative for us to be able to support people in our region but, at the same time, support our farmers, who are crying out for labour at the moment.

                                . The point of order is on direct relevance. The question goes directly to whether or not this new agricultural visa will mirror the Seasonal Worker Program or extend the working holiday scheme. They are different schemes with different conditions. We have not asked about those existing schemes. We've asked, as to the new scheme: which architecture will it follow? So I would ask you to remind the minister that she is not being asked to give us an explanation of why the

                                or the working holiday visa are such great things. She's being asked to explain the new agricultural visa.

                                 Let me finish, please, Senator Wong. To be directly relevant, because it was a tightly-worded question, the minister must speak about the new scheme.

                                     Senators on my left, we are wasting question time, which is traditionally a period for the non-government parties. I would not have been able to rule on a subsequent point of order then, because I could not hear Senator Ruston. So there is way too much noise in the chamber. Senator Sheldon, a final supplementary question?

                                         We absolutely have not. What we have sought to do is to make sure that we support Australians, through a number of initiatives, who wish to get into work, but, at the same time, we also recognise that there are some sectors of the Australian economy that are crying out for workers at the moment and are unable to fill those particular positions within Australia. So what this government has sought to do is to have a suite of measures that support everybody in the Australian economy, whether it be Australians who find themselves out of work, and making sure that we provide them with the skills and the retraining so that they can get back into the workforce, but which, at the same time, support our farmers, who are crying out for labour. So what we will do is continue to make sure that we address all of the issues that our economy faces, going forward, and not just one of them, by making sure we support our businesses to make sure they've got employees and then support our Australians into work.
