        This report of the Joint Standing Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital
        </a>
        and External Territories into the changing economic environment in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Indian Ocean
        </a>
        Territories was presented out of session. Through this inquiry, the committee sought to examine the issues associated with economic development in the context of the service delivery of communications, transport and housing; the operation of business; and preparations to deal with the impact of climate change. During the inquiry, several solutions were canvassed in each area examined.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee focused on how communications, internet services and mobile telephony were delivered. To improve internet delivery and access, options identified were either to upgrade the satellite link to the Indian Ocean territories or to access a cable if and when it is laid. Improving mobile telephony was found to be more complex as the service available on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        is limited and the service available on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands prone to failure. New infrastructure will be needed to implement an efficient, reliable and affordable mobile telephony service.
       </p>
       <p>
        The high cost and unreliability of freight and passenger services have remained major areas of concern for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOT" rel="nofollow">
         IOT
        </a>
        s. As outlined in previous reports, the committee found that options to improve the service delivery of these in the short term rests with the government through subsidies in infrastructure investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another major issue highlighted was the limited land made available for commercial development and investment. The committee found that investment in the Indian Ocean territories is critical to growing the economies, and has recommended the development of a land release and development strategy to stimulate the local construction industries and investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The social impacts accompanying the economic challenges facing the Indian Ocean territories relate to, in part, a diminishing permanent population and the limited contact that occurs with mainland and wider Australian society. In addition there is the challenge of the fluctuating non-permanent population associated with the demands placed on Christmas Island in particular with regard to the detention centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        The shires of the Indian Ocean territories are focused on addressing the decreasing permanent population by mainly targeting the youth segment that is leaving in search of greater educational and employment opportunities. The committee believes that by improving economic diversity, the economies of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands would be better able to sustain themselves into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank individuals and organisations who participated in the inquiry. The committee was able to conduct public hearings on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. I would also like to acknowledge and thank those who generously assisted the committee during that visit. I particularly acknowledge and thank the joint standing committee secretariat,
