        Poker machines are a major community concern in Australia today.

        </a>
        ’s Poker Machine Harm Reduction Tax (Administration) Bill 2008 would introduce a new federal tax on poker machines in pubs and clubs to push pokies out of these community venues and restrict them to casinos and racetracks, which are dedicated gambling venues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Poker machines are no good for families:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         About 293,000 people have a significant gambling problem in Australia and about 85% of problem gamblers use poker machines;
        </li>
        <li>
         About 52% of problem gamblers said they had borrowed money and not paid it back, 36% said they had sold property to raise money to bet and 43% said they sometimes went without food to pay for their addiction. One in four suffered divorce or separation and one in 10 had seriously contemplated suicide;
        </li>
        <li>
         On average around seven other people are affected by a severe problem gambler’s behaviour. That’s around 2 million Australians;
        </li>
        <li>
         More than 50% of regular poker machine users are problem gamblers or at risk of becoming problem gamblers.

        The National Market Driven Energy Efficiency Target Bill 2007 is a private Senator’s bill which was referred to the committee on 16 August 2007 for report by 22 October 2007. Nine submissions were received, however no hearings were conducted.
