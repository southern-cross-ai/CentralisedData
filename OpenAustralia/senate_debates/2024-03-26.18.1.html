       <p>
        Family and domestic violence continues to be alarmingly common in Australia. I rise to speak about coercive control, which often underpins the abusive dynamic. Unfortunately, some people in this chamber, like Senator Hanson, have made some appalling comments about the nature of domestic violence, so I want to set the record straight and outline why this issue is important and a big priority for our government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coercive control isn't necessarily physical. Rather, it involves perpetrators using patterns of abusive behaviour over time to create fear, power and dominance over a person and to deny a person's liberty and autonomy. We know this issue requires a coordinated approach, so the National Principles to Address Coercive Control in Family and

        have been developed in collaboration with all state and territory governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that note, I'd like to commend Stopping

         Family Violence
        </a>
        Inc., the peak body in WA supporting the services involved in providing essential support, training and care to victims-survivors of coercive control. Stopping Family Violence have recently collaborated with Wungening Aboriginal Corporation and Geraldton Regional Aboriginal Medical Service to produce culturally informed programs that aim to strengthen early intervention with men who choose to use violence. This project has been supported by the Albanese government, with $3.3 million in funding provided under the Innovative Perpetrator Response initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the fight against domestic and family violence, everyone has a role to play, and I want to especially thank the incredible WA organisations that are on the front line protecting women and children and also give a big shout-out to Nicola Stokes for bringing this matter to our attention.
