        It's our constant duty as Australians to remember and honour our Anzac heroes who fought for, and secured, the freedoms and way of life we enjoy today in Australia. Physical monuments remain one of the best ways for us to ensure that their brave sacrifice is not forgotten by communities across our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the spirit of this, today I'd like to recognise in this place the newly opened remembrance park in the Shire of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Rock" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in the Wheatbelt region of my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The park was officially unveiled on 6 November, and I was very sorry and very disappointed that other commitments meant that I couldn't attend that ceremony in person. But I was delighted that my good friend, shire president
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strange" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , supported by the local community, was able to come out in support of this wonderful initiative. This beautiful tribute to our Anzac past was made possible by the Morrison government with funding through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program and the Saluting their Service program. The project is part of the Shire of Bruce Rock's main street revitalisation strategy, upgrading the existing remembrance sculpture into a park, complete with artwork, interpretive signage and landscaping.

        For many, many years, the community of Bruce Rock has welcomed into their town many, many Vietnam and Afghanistan war veterans. As the son of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        veteran, I'm delighted and excited by the hospitality that this community continually provides to ex-service men and women. Fittingly, the new memorial features a plaque adorned with a quote from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" rel="nofollow">
         Benjamin Franklin
        </a>
        : 'There was never a good war or a bad peace.' I look forward to my next visit to Bruce Rock and the communities across WA's Wheatbelt districts and seeing the memorial for myself. Again, I congratulate the town and the community of Bruce Rock for their wonderful warmth.
