        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. This week the United Kingdom hosted the Ukraine Recovery Conference, at which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        Secretary of State Blinken announced a further US$1.3 billion to help reconstruct Ukraine's energy grid and transport infrastructure and to support Ukraine's economic recovery. Unlike the US, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , Japan and other like-minded partners, Australian ministers did not invest the time to attend the Ukraine Recovery Conference. Minister, how much has the Albanese government invested to support humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Ukraine since coming to office?

         I thank the senator for his question, and I do acknowledge his serious interest in and focus on national security and foreign policy. Particularly at these times, I think it is a good thing if we have people from different political parties and across the chamber who actually take a serious interest in these matters.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Fawcett has asked a number of questions about this, and I would make the first point about ministerial representation. It's pretty disappointing, isn't it, when that is the basis of a question and where the opposition—on the one hand, Mr Dutton complains about the Prime Minister going to international events, and then you come in here and complain that I've actually turned up in the Senate to answer questions as opposed to going to this event. The opposition really can't have it both ways. You can't say, on the one hand, 'You're doing too much travelling, Prime Minister,' demand parliamentary accountability and then have a go at us for deciding that we probably should make sure we attend parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         As is appropriate in such circumstances where parliamentary duties have prevented Australian ministers from attending—and obviously Senator Payne well knows you can't attend everything—we have asked our high commissioner,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Smith

         , who is obviously a former defence and foreign minister. I also provided a message to the conference.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm coming to the quantum.

             There was a comment made at the beginning about representation. I understand that we have provided some total of $680 million to date, including $510 million in military assistance. I know the senator has raised, I think in estimates, the provision of the small amount of moneys—

               Minister, you are correct, and I will repeat that here: Australia is well placed to help Ukraine's recovery, particularly with our world-class expertise in removing landmines and unexploded ordnance.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN" rel="nofollow">

               stats confirm that such devices have killed or injured over 800 people, including 94 children, since Russia's illegal invasion began in February 2022. Your department has confirmed that there is $12.9 million uncommitted from the humanitarian emergency fund. Will you use this to support de-mining operations urgently needed in Ukraine?

                I acknowledge the senator did ask these questions in estimates, and I also acknowledge he has raised this with me and I have not had the opportunity in the hours since yesterday afternoon to check on his request on this fund. I will ascertain precisely. I have just asked my office to provide a response to the aspect of the question relating to the humanitarian emergency fund.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would make the point that obviously we stand with Ukraine and, for all the reasons we know, against the illegal and immoral invasion by Russia. We continue to provide support. The senator would know there are many humanitarian emergencies around the world at this stage, sadly, and some come to mind. Obviously, Sudan is one of them. So there are many calls on our humanitarian emergency funding, and we will continue to consider all requests.
