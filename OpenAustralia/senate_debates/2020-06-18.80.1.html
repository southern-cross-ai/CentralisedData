            Unfortunately, this motion is just another example of the shameless spin and marketing that we've come to expect from a government that has left bushfire victims behind. We all know that the government's bushfire recovery efforts have been lousy. Just ask the 96 per cent of people in bushfire-hit regions who haven't received help or the two-thirds of bushfire victims in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

            who are still waiting for the debris on their properties to be cleared. This government continues to overpromise and underdeliver on the bushfires. Just a quarter of the notional $2 billion fund has got out the door, six months after the bushfires—just one quarter. The Liberals' and Nationals' response to bushfire recovery has been slow, it's been inconsistent and it's been confusing for thousands of Australians who just want to get on with their lives in the land they love. It says so much about the Morrison government, and particularly the National Party, that, instead of getting on with the job and actually helping bushfire victims, they just move self-indulgent motions to give themselves a pat on the back. It's a disgrace, and they should actually help bushfire victims instead of just doing more marketing.

               Part (a) of this motion, recognising what regional Australia has gone through, the Greens support, because regional Australia has gone through a massive amount in the last six months. There was the huge summer of bushfires; in fact, there was a spring and summer and autumn of fires, unprecedented fires, fires that covered a proportion of Australia never seen before. And then there was the COVID pandemic as well hitting these regions—hitting their local tourism areas, hitting their ability to function. We absolutely as Greens support regional Australia. But the gall of this government to pretend that they are working in the interest of regional Australia! On bushfires, you have people in

               who are still living in tents. People in East Gippsland and other fire affected areas have not been able to access support. The gall of them to do that!
