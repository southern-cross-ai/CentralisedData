        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Can the minister update the Senate on the actions the Australian government is taking to uphold rules and norms in our region, including the

         I thank Senator Marielle Smith, who understands the importance of international law to shaping a peaceful, stable and prosperous region for our people and for our nation. The observation of rules and norms in the region is what supports peace, security and stability, and Australia's support for international law is why we strongly support the 2016

         arbitral award, which is final and binding on the parties. Our continued support for international law and the arbitral award is also why the Deputy Prime Minister announced last week that Australia would conduct the inaugural Philippines-Australia maritime cooperative activity. This activity was the first joint sail between the Australian and Philippines armed forces in the West Philippines sea. The maritime cooperative activity included the Philippine navy vessels

         Our joint activity demonstrates our shared commitment to exercising freedom of navigation and overflight consistent with international law in support of a peaceful, stable and secure Indo-Pacific. We will continue to operate closely with our friends in the region, such as the Philippines, to advocate for the importance of international law. We're putting in the work engaging with our partners, repairing our international relationships and acting accordingly. Unlike Mr Dutton, we are not just talking tough and leaving a vacuum for others to fill, as we saw in the Pacific in the period of the Morrison government. I have often spoken in the visits I have made to

            We are a government that is working to deepen Australia's relationship with the Philippines. The Prime Minister visited the Philippines in September this year to meet with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Marcos" rel="nofollow">
             President Marcos
            </a>
            . I had the honour of visiting the Philippines to meet Secretary Manalo, which was one of several meetings we've had this year, including a two-plus-two with Minister Farrell in Adelaide. The Deputy Prime Minister has had productive meetings with his counterpart, Secretary Teodoro.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the key outcomes of the Prime Minister's visit was the upgrade of our relationship to a strategic partnership, and a key tenet of that partnership is to deepen our strong maritime cooperation. This cooperation recognises that the Philippines is central to maintaining peace and stability in our region. For all of their tough talk, the Liberals had nine years and three prime ministers, and they couldn't manage one standalone visit to the Philippines.

               The government has been working to repair our international relationships in order to make us stronger and more influential in the world, and we've done so consistently, we've done so calmly, and we've done so without compromising on what is important to Australians. That is why we are working to progress AUKUS, the agreement with our partners in the United States and the United Kingdom. That is why we are implementing the Defence Strategic Review. That's why we are working so hard to have open dialogue and close engagement with our friends and partners.
              </p>
              <p>
               Australia wants to contribute to a strategic balance, and that is what we are doing, because it is that strategic balance which underpins the stability, prosperity and peace that all of us seek. What we unfortunately have from Mr Dutton is the same failed old playbook. For nine long years, those opposite were more interested in gaining attention than getting outcomes, despite the fact that they themselves proved that shouting about national security did nothing to make Australia more secure.
