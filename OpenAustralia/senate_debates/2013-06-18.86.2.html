        Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The homelessness sector believes the bill is not rights based legislation (as was promised originally) that demonstrates or explicitly states the government is progressively committed to providing affordable housing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As such, funding for homelessness services and housing provided under the National Affordable Housing Agreement and in the National Rental Affordable Scheme for example should be covered in a homelessness bill. No financial arrangements or commitments are covered in this bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's also a confusing bill that talks about rights and obligations under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights
        </a>
        treaties-but the bill ends by stating it cancels out any legal obligation to give an avenue for recourse with regard to those treaties. Finally the definition of homelessness is problematic to the sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The homelessness sector is extremely concerned and disappointed this Bill has no teeth and adds no value to the homelessness response.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The long delay for this Bill is also a reason for concern. The bill was a recommendation from the Inquiry as part of the government's

An inquiry is required to ensure no adverse impacts arise that would prohibit businesses from accessing the skilled labour they need to support Australian jobs and Australian investment.

         I speak to the motion that the report be adopted, to commend the adoption of report No. 6 and also to express my delight and surprise that the committee and the government accepted a number of the reference proposals that the opposition put forward to the committee, particularly in relation to some education bills and migration bills. I was also delighted and surprised that the government accepted the reporting dates that the opposition proposed.
        </p>
        <p>
         I express my sincerest desire that the committees to which these references have been made feel under absolutely no pressure from the government to adopt reporting dates which would seek to circumvent the proper examination of the legislation that has been referred to these committees. I am sure that will not happen, but it would be disturbing if these committees felt pressured by the government to perhaps report earlier than the date which has been agreed upon by the committee and the dates which have been accepted by the Senate chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thought it was important to put on record my pleasure and delight at the work of the committee, the fact that it looks like the chamber will unanimously adopt this report, and that it would be a bad precedent if pressure were brought to bear on the committees in question to seek to subvert the will expressed by the committees and the will that is, I think, about to be expressed by this chamber. I am sure all interested stakeholders will be watching closely.
