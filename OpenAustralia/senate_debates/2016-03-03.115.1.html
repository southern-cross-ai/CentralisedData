        My question is to the Attorney-General in his capacity representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the negotiated cessation of hostilities in the Syrian civil war that has opened space for a resumption of substantive peace talks, now scheduled to recommence on 9 March. My question is: what is the Australian government doing to support the cessation of hostilities in this conflict? Can the Attorney provide any details of diplomatic support, personnel, resources or anything that the minister cares to name that indicate that Australia is playing a role in de-escalating this conflict?

            I am surprised that the notion of senatorial courtesy evinces mockery from the opposition. I have obtained some information from the Foreign Minister's office so that I can respond to your question. As you know, it is vital that political negotiations between the Syrian regime and Syrian opposition resume on 9 March, as announced by envoy Staffan de Mistura yesterday. The two-day delay from the earlier proposed date—that is, 7 March—allows the cessation of hostilities take hold.
           </p>
           <p>
            Australia's position has been to call on all sides to engage constructively in the negotiations process. Countries with influence in the Syrian conflict should bring pressure to bear on the parties they support to negotiate in good faith. It is important that a transnational governing body with full executive powers, as agreed by the international community in Geneva Communique and

             United Nations Security Council Resolution

            2254, be established. That is the Australian government's position. That is the position we have advocated, and that is the position we have advocated to the parties.

             , I ask a supplementary question. I just draw the Attorney's attention to my question around resourcing personnel, if he cares to address that. Can the minister outline Australia's long-term strategy, if it has one, in ensuring a peaceful settlement to the Syrian conflict and the demilitarisation of the region more broadly?

             <p>
              Yes, I can. Ultimately, the only solution to the Syria crisis is, of course, to end the conflict. The cessation of hostilities agreed between the United States and Russia appears to be largely holding for now. Of course, Australia supports that ceasefire, although there have been a number of reports of violations. We call on all parties to comply with the terms of the cessation of hostilities on the ground, and we call on all countries with influence in Syria to maintain pressure on combatants to ensure compliance.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is the Australian government's position that all parties need to focus their efforts on defeating Daesh and other terrorist groups in both Syria and Iraq. The Australian government welcomes the implementation of the International Syria Support Group's decisions to facilitate the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to besieged areas. We understand that food, medical supplies, water and sanitation kits have reached several besieged towns in Syria. I can elaborate further on that in response to your next question.

               , I ask a further supplementary question. Attorney, I again draw your attention to this: the questions go directly to Australian resourcing commitments rather than simply position. Given that other parties to the conflict are finally working towards demilitarising the region, will the Australian government withdraw the

               from this conflict and instead prioritise support for the peace process and expedite the processing of refugees fleeing the war, as the government of Canada has done?

                There are a number of issues there. Let me deal with the last one first. As you know, Australia—I believe with support from your party, along with other parties in this chamber—agreed last September to accept 12,000 humanitarian refugees fleeing from the Syrian conflict. We are processing those refugees in a careful and methodical way; we have begun that. The first of those refugees have arrived, as you know. We are identifying suitable candidates and subjecting them to appropriate tests, including security tests.

                 , I rise on a point of order. I recognise that it was a multipart question. I draw the Attorney's attention to the substance of the question: what is Australia specifically doing to resource the peace process, and can the minister confirm that only 26 refugees have in fact been settled since September?
