        On behalf of Senator Fawcett, I present the 147th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties:
        <i>

         Mr President
        </a>
        , today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties'
        <i>
         Report 147.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         The Report
        </a>
        contains the Committee's views on three proposed treaties: the World Trade Organization Protocol Amending the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
         WTO
        </a>
        and including the Agreement on Trade Facilitation, the First Protocol to Amend the Agreement Establishing the

         Mutual Legal Assistance
        </a>
        in Criminal Matters between Australia and Vietnam.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation is an important step forward in developing a multilateral trade system. It is a significant milestone; the first major agreement concluded since the WTO was established in 1995. The aim of the agreement is to increase transparency and remove red tape relating to customs regulations and procedures across international boundaries. It is estimated that, if the agreement is fully implemented, it could add $
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USI" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        trillion to the world economy and create 21 million jobs by cutting trade costs. Mr President, it is vitally important for Australian businesses and industry to benefit from this global economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Despite the hard work being done to remove tariff barriers, it is often the behind-the-scenes non-tariff barriers that discourage trade participation. Mr President, complex paper-work or the fear that perishable goods will be held up in foreign ports can stop an Australian business from taking advantage of the opportunities provided by trade agreements. This agreement will make a difference in this regard.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area is Australia's largest free trade agreement, accounting for 18 per cent of our total trade in goods and services and worth $121.6 billion in 2013-14. With a combined population of 650 million people, the parties to this agreement account for $4.1 billion of global
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        . It is important that Australian businesses and industry can make full use of the agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments to the agreement are designed to simplify and harmonise administrative requirements. Again the paper-work will become simpler, easier to fill out and comply with. By making trade easier for Australian exporters and importers, the amendments are expected to encourage better use of the agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, mutual assistance treaties develop and strengthen Australia's capacity to fight international crime. Currently Australia is party to 29 such agreements. The treaty on mutual legal assistance between Australia and Vietnam provides for the two countries to exchange information and evidence for investigating or prosecuting serious crimes. It will make sure that criminals cannot evade justice solely because evidence of their criminal activity is located in another country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, Vietnam is already a valuable Australian partner in the fight against transnational crime in our region and this agreement will strengthen that relationship. This agreement will complement existing treaties between the two countries on extradition and transfer of sentenced persons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the Committee supports the ratification of these three treaties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the Report to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
