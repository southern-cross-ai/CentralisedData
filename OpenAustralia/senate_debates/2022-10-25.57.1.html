        My question is to the Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Watt. Minister, I note with concern the devastating impact that floods are having on so many Victorians throughout my state. Could you please update the Senate on the current flood and severe weather situation affecting not just Victoria but also

         Thanks, Senator Ciccone; I know you speak for many people on both sides of this chamber with your level of concern about these floods. As senators will be aware, Australia is now seeing the impact of a third consecutive
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Nina" rel="nofollow">
          La Nina

         event, with flooding impacting many communities across the country. Over the last few weeks we've seen flooding across Victoria,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , Queensland, Tasmania and now
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , and the sad reality is that this dangerous weather is far from over.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of immediate concern is the heavy rainfall that has impacted north-east New South Wales in the past 24 hours, with the front now moving down the coast towards eastern Victoria. There are multiple emergency warnings current across both Victoria and New South Wales right now, and my message to people in those states is: please listen to the authorities and heed their warnings and advice. We've already, tragically, seen six fatalities as a result of these recent floods, and we don't want to see more.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week the Prime Minister and I visited the communities of Bendigo, Deloraine, Latrobe, Launceston and Forbes, where we met with a range of first responders and impacted farmers and communities. I also visited Seymour in central Victoria with Victorian minister Jaclyn Symes and the local federal MP, Sam Birrell, and held an online community forum with leaders from across Shepparton to hear from these communities directly. I've also been in regular contact with many other affected MPs from across all sides of the political divide.
        </p>
        <p>
         While these floods have been devastating for many, there has been some positive news along the way. During our time in Tasmania, the Prime Minister and I visited Michael Perkins's dairy farm along with Senator Urquhart. During the 2016 floods the Perkins family lost 48 heifers from their Latrobe dairy farm. I was heartened to hear that, through improvements to warning systems, Michael was able to prepare earlier, ultimately keeping all of his animals safe. And that was something I heard throughout Tasmania.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're thinking of all the communities impacted by these events. We know this repeated, relentless flooding is tough, and we'll be there to support people now and as they recover.

            As a government, we are standing with our state and territory counterparts, along with local governments and communities, supporting all of those governments to respond to the particular needs of local communities. As of 5 pm yesterday our government has activated the 13-week disaster recovery allowance payment for this event across 17 council areas in Tasmania, 46 council areas in Victoria and 43 council areas in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            . This provides some income relief for those eligible people who have lost income due to the floods. We have also activated the Australian government disaster recovery payment in 30 council areas across Tasmania and Victoria, providing one-off payments to eligible adults and children.
           </p>
           <p>
            On top of this, we are also working with the states to deliver joint support to help with clean-up, as well as specialised grants for impacted small businesses and primary producers. I am certainly aware of the significant impact these floods have had on farmers and the infrastructure they rely on to get products to market. We will continue to work with all levels of government across Australia to ensure people get the help they need.

               When I spoke to people in Seymour nine days ago, the biggest message they had was the need to get recovery support in quickly. They told me very clearly that any delay in starting their clean-up would lead to longer-term issues. The

               in every state do an excellent job, but this is a big event over a long period of time. So, after consultation with the defence minister, I've approved requests for up to 600 ADF personnel across Victoria and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               at the request of those state governments.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our fantastic defence forces have been doing an outstanding job helping with sandbagging, evacuations and now supporting clean-up operations, damage assessments and the provision and resupply of essential food and supplies to isolated communities. We've also approved the use of ADF helicopters in both New South Wales and Victoria for everything from mass evacuations, if needed, to lifting heavy equipment. I want to thank the ADF for making these personnel and resources available and, of course, I want to thank those boots on the ground for their efforts in helping these communities recover. I know very well the morale boost it provides to communities.
