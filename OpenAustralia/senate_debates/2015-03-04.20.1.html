        I table an explanatory memorandum relating to the government's amendments moved to the Enhancing Online Safety for Children Bill 2014, and I will provide some background to the amendments that I have moved. Currently clause 50 of the bill sets out the eligibility criteria for the statutory role of the Children's e-Safety Commissioner. It states that the minister must be satisfied that a person is not eligible to be appointed as the commissioner unless they have substantial experience or knowledge and significant standing in at least one of a range of fields, including the fields of the operation of social media services and public engagement on issues relating to online safety. The amendments put forward today will expand the range of fields to include experience or knowledge in child welfare or child wellbeing. These amendments respond to submissions made by a number of stakeholders to the Senate committee inquiry into the bill.

         I indicate that Labor will be supporting the amendments moved by the government. The amendments state that experience or knowledge in the field of child welfare or wellbeing will be a desirable quality that the minister may consider when appointing a person as the e-Safety Commissioner. These are common-sense amendments which take into account the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee's recommendations. The shadow assistant minister for communications, the member for Greenway, flagged in speech in the second reading debate in the House that Labor would support the bill subject to any recommendations made by the committee. The committee process has proved useful and Labor will be supporting the government's amendments.

         <p>
          I alluded to this amendment in my second reading contribution on this bill. I accept and respect that the government wants to enhance online safety for children, and having an e-safety commissioner is an important step in respect of that process.
         </p>
         <p>
          I previously introduced a bill in this place in respect of the misrepresentations made to children online. It arose out of the tragic circumstances of the Carly Ryan case, where Carly was murdered in 2007 as a result of an online predator misrepresenting his age to her. This person was contacting something like 200 young girls around the world and was misrepresenting who he was. He had misrepresented himself as someone who was in his late teens or 20 years old. Eventually when he met Carly on a beach at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Bay" rel="nofollow">
           Horseshoe Bay
          </a>
          in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          he murdered her. The Carly Ryan Foundation has been outspoken, passionate and reasoned in strengthening online safety, and it is on their behalf that I move this amendment. Sonia Ryan, the mother of Carly, has been a passionate advocate for the protection of children online.
         </p>
         <p>
          I understand that this amendment goes beyond what the bill is purporting to do, but it is consistent with the theme of the bill—to protect children online. I will not be seeking to divide in respect of this amendment. I understand that it is not supported by the government or the opposition. I am still optimistic that there will be a process to work through with the Attorney-General's office, the minister's office and the parliamentary secretary's office in respect of communications.
         </p>
         <p>
          Essentially, this amendment makes it an offence for an adult to misrepresent their age to a person under the age of 16—in other words, to a child—and, in addition, attempt to meet that child. In my second reading contribution, I said that, if a 50- or 60-year old man is communicating with a 13-year-old girl or boy and saying that they are a teenager as well and then attempts to meet them, that ought to be an offence. Under our current legislation you need to show a sexual intent. You need to show that it is for the purpose of grooming a child for sexual exploitation. I think that there is a gap in legislation in terms of online safety.
         </p>
         <p>
          I say this without any rancour. I understand that I do not have the numbers for this, that the government and the opposition do not yet support this position. But I will patiently, with goodwill, work with my colleagues to keep raising this. I am raising it again today in the context of this amendment.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
           If I
          </a>
          can get an indication from the opposition and the government of what their position is, all I ask is that they keep the dialogue going in respect of this, because it is a loophole in our current laws. I am not suggesting that the offence should carry as heavy a penalty as there is for grooming or for sexual exploitation—obviously not—but this could be a very useful tool for our law enforcement agencies to nip in the bud behaviour that I think most Australians would say is wrong, and not just morally wrong; it ought to be wrong at law for an adult to lie about their age and, in addition to that, attempt to meet the child. Essentially that is what this amendment addresses. I am pleased that I had a meeting with the parliamentary secretary this morning. I will raise these questions with the Children's e-Safety Commissioner in due course. I am grateful for the ongoing dialogue I have had with the Attorney-General in respect of this, but to put it colloquially, in terms of 'the pub test', if you are a 50-year-old man contacting a 13-year-old boy or girl and you try and meet them, I reckon that should be an offence.

           Labor will not be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Xenophon. It is not a reflection on him. The issue of grooming which Senator Xenophon's amendment goes to is obviously a very serious issue. Labor senators share Senator Xenophon's concerns and would be more than happy to work constructively with him to properly address the issue. However, there has been no consultation or engagement with the opposition on this amendment and no time for the opposition to consider its implications. While we appreciate Senator Xenophon's intentions, we are not in a position to support his amendment without being given enough time to consider the broader implications. The telecommunication-specific provisions in the schedule of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
            Criminal Code
           </a>
           Act are complex and carefully drafted in a way that gives effect not only to the Commonwealth law but also to relevant state and territory law. Any consideration to amend these provisions must be undertaken in consultation with a range of law enforcement agencies and our state and territory counterparts. At such a late hour in the legislative passage of the bill before us, this simply cannot occur. It is for this reason that Labor do not support Senator Xenophon's amendment. But we do support the bill.

            I want to acknowledge Senator Xenophon's great interest in this area and the strong support and representations he has provided for people who have been subject to inappropriate contact through the internet. Everyone in this place, when we are talking about these subjects, always comes with goodwill and good intentions. Senator Xenophon has indicated that he knows, from discussions with the government already, that we will not be supporting his amendment, but I think Senator Xenophon has had some good discussions, particularly with the parliamentary secretary, and the government obviously will keep talking with Senator Xenophon. But I did just want to acknowledge Senator Xenophon's important work and interest in this area.

             I am grateful to the opposition and the government for their responses. There was a previous committee report where both the government and the opposition did support a similar amendment. There is currently a bill—and this amendment is based on that bill—that is being considered by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. I think it is fair to say that the opposition and the government have not come to the same position as the Carly Ryan Foundation has. The issue will not go away. I accept the goodwill with which all members of this place and all parties are treating my amendment. I respectfully suggest that the time will come when the law will be changed, because it ought to be an offence for an adult to communicate with a child when the adult lies about their age and then attempts to meet that child. Let us see what the Children's e-Safety Commissioner says about this. I will be engaging with whomever the commissioner will be. I will keep trying. I owe it to Sonya Ryan and the Carly Ryan Foundation to keep trying in respect of this. It is something that both parties have considered in the past and have rejected, but that is fine. I say this without any rancour at all. I am hoping that we will get there, with goodwill, and get bipartisan, in fact cross-party, support for this amendment eventually.

              I think all colleagues would agree with Senator Xenophon's 'pub test' application to the characterisation of certain individuals making contact with minors. There are few things that are more abhorrent than the grooming of children, and I just again wanted to put that on the record.

               It was remiss of me not to make specific reference to Senator Polley's contribution, which I appreciated. This is not a rebuke to Senator Polley—I would not dare ever rebuke Senator Polley, because I am not that silly!—but this is not actually a grooming offence, because there are specific offences in respect of grooming. This actually is a step before that—to say that there ought to be some offence for an adult communicating with a child and attempting to meet that child. At the moment, you need to show grooming for a sexual purpose, for the purpose of child exploitation. I am suggesting that there is certain behaviour that falls short of that—it is almost preparatory to that—where there is currently a gap in the law. I think that is what we need to address. I just wanted to clarify that. It is not a rebuke, Senator Polley. I could not bear the consequences of rebuking you!
