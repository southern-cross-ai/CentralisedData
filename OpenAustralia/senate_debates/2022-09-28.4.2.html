       <p>
        I wish to make a statement to the chamber. After yesterday's debate, Senator McKim asked me to reflect on the right of senators to raise points of order. The issue of points of order arose during the debate on the motion moved by Senators Faruqi and Waters. Senators will recall that at the outset of the debate it was impossible to hear Senator Faruqi's contribution, because of the level of interjection. I called senators to order on several occasions, asking that they respect the right of senators to be heard in silence in what was clearly a sensitive debate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I considered that the best approach I could bring to maintaining order was to require the debate to proceed without further interventions. This is not an approach I would ordinarily take, but I thought it was warranted on this occasion. I appreciate that some senators found this approach frustrating, and I thank Senator Waters for discussing these matters with me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do recognise that senators ought to have the opportunity to raise points of order in relation to matters then before the Senate, as provided in standing order 197(2). I remind senators that in raising points of order all of us have a responsibility to raise those points of order in a serious and sensible and practical manner. Of course, the parliament should be a place of robust debate where ideas are put, contested and sometimes agreed, where these ideas are put in a respectful way and acknowledged in a respectful way.

        review urges us to prioritise a safe and respectful culture and model safe and respectful behaviour. The burden of this cultural change in this workplace rests on all of us. It is up to each one of us to take positive steps and set the gold standard of what is and is not acceptable conduct. Thank you, senators.
