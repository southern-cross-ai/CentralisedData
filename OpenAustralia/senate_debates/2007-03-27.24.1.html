        , on 21 March 2007, Senator Siewert asked me a question and also a supplementary question, and I undertook to get back to the honourable senator. I now have answers and I seek leave to incorporate the answers in

        allocation dropped below 50 per cent next year or they could not maintain weir levels, they would be forced to cut the supply of water to a number of lakes, lagoons and wetlands. Would such an action be compatible with, and supported by, the national water plan? Given the current predictions for reduced inflows into the Murray-Darling, does the minister consider it likely that this will occur?”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Abetz—The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The South Australian Government’s announcement of the potential closure of the wetlands is a result of the record dry conditions being experienced in the Murray-Darling Basin. If 2007 is very dry or a repeat of 2006 then the critical needs of many towns, in particular Adelaide, which rely on the water systems of the southern Murray-Darling Basin could be at risk. While there are signs the drought will break, it is prudent to plan for the contingency that it will not.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With proper preparations, the critical demands of urban areas and towns, and other households relying on the water supply systems of the southern Murray-Darling Basin, will be able to be met. Senior officials from jurisdictions across the Basin have worked together collaboratively and have made recommendations to governments about improving the flexibility of the system. The recommendations are being implemented as necessary.

        A group of eight wetlands in South Australia and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        have been identified by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission (MDBC) as offering relatively high yields in evaporative savings with manageable costs and environmental impacts under such extreme circumstances. Some of the wetlands announced for potential closure by South Australia on 20 March 2007, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Bonney" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Bonney
        </a>
        and the Gurra Gurra Lakes, are among the eight wetlands identified by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission.

       <p class="italic">
        The wetlands proposed for disconnection are generally those that have been artificially inundated with permanent water because they are used to store water. Under natural conditions, it is likely that these wetlands would be dry in the current season and drought and disconnection may help mimic a more natural wetting and drying regime, which is likely to be beneficial providing they receive flooding waters in future when required. Wetlands, where disconnection would be problematic in terms of environmental and cultural heritage impacts, will not be affected by this measure. Any action that will or is likely to have an impact on matters of national environmental significance will be subject to the

        Senator Siewert asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, which was taken on notice, on 21 March 2007:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. That would be appreciated and perhaps, in that case, he could also tell us how much of the already allocated $10 billion has been spent to date purchasing water to return flows to threatened wetlands. Also, will the government move to urgently buy water to save these wetlands and prevent them being cut off?”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Abetz – The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The funds for the $10 billion National Plan for Water Security are contingent on the referral of powers from the States. On 23 February 2007 all Murray-Darling Basin States other than Victoria agreed to a clear referral of constitutional powers to manage water in the Basin in the national interest. Discussions with Victoria on this issue are continuing. Funding was not budgeted to become available until 1 July 2007 therefore none has been spent to date.

        is not intending to urgently buy water for these wetlands identified by the Senator.
