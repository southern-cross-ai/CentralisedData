        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Faulkner. Can the minister update the Senate on the importance of developments in Pakistan in more recent days—both the political conflict surrounding the march on Islamabad and the reinstatement of the chief justice. What impact might these developments have on the security of both Pakistan and Afghanistan?

         I thank Senator Bishop for his question. As the foreign minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Smith
         </a>
         , told the House of Representatives on 23 February, Pakistan is one of the most strategically important countries in the world. Australia is committed to assisting Pakistan tackle its many internal security, economic and social challenges. Not only is Pakistan important in its own right but in Australia we recognise that the acute problems in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area have adverse implications for Afghanistan. In addition, the threat of terrorism and extremism in Pakistan itself has become so grave that it is, as President Zardari himself has acknowledged, a threat to Pakistan’s very existence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia condemns the most recent terrorist outrage in Pakistan when, yesterday, eight people were reportedly killed in a bomb attack in Rawalpindi. While we condemn this latest terrorist atrocity, Australia welcomes the news overnight that Senator Bishop referred to: that the government of Pakistan has decided to reinstate Chief Justice Chaudhry and that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has called off the long-march protest against the government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia’s strong view remains that democracy and the rule of law are essential parts of achieving peace and stability in Pakistan. We welcome signs that political parties in Pakistan can resolve their differences peacefully and lawfully. Australia does not underestimate the challenges facing Pakistan’s political leaders at this time and we now urge those leaders and the Pakistani people to work together to tackle that country’s internal challenges.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
            Mr Smith
           </a>

            UN
           </a>
           General Assembly last year. In this task, the international community, including Australia, will work with Pakistan. Mr Smith made this point directly to Pakistan’s leaders during his visit last month and on a number of occasions since. In addition, Australia is strongly committed to working with the government of Pakistan to reduce poverty, particularly in the border regions with Afghanistan where some of the poorest and most marginalised populations live. Improving basic services such as health and education is one of the best strategies to contribute to building a stable and democratic Pakistan. Australia is significantly increasing development assistance to Pakistan, focusing on health and education as well as support, of course, for democratic institutions.

             It is clear that the international community faces a serious ongoing threat from terrorism in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. While taking into account their distinctive histories and circumstances, the challenges that face these two countries need to be treated together.
