         Yes, Senator Hume, I can. I thank you very much for your question and acknowledge your strong interest in creating jobs in our home state of Victoria.

         -National government knows that the best form of financial security is having a job, and I'm pleased to report to the Senate that this government's strong economic plan continues to see more Australians in work than ever before. The latest data released today shows record highs in the total number of people employed in this country. More Australians with more jobs means a healthier economy and, more importantly, increased opportunities to build meaningful careers. We're also at record highs when it comes to full-time employment—up to 8,654,000 full-time jobs. Happily, unemployment is down to five per cent, the best result in six years and well below the rate recorded this time last year. Since September 2013, under the Liberal-National government, employment has increased by more than 1,000,100 jobs. That's a 10 per cent rise. That's more than one million Australians who now have a brighter future.
        </p>
        <p>
         These figures are incredibly positive, because having a job doesn't just bring with it greater financial security; it means more options and greater independence for workers, especially for Australians living in regional areas, and it means growth and productivity gains for small businesses who employ them. There is always more work to do, but it's clear our strong economic plan is working. The economy is growing at a 3.4 per cent growth rate. We are the envy of the G7, and it's Australians up and down the country who are sharing in the benefits.

            Thank you, Senator Hume, for your supplementary question. Today's job figures continue to show that, of the more than 1.1 million jobs created since we came to office, the majority have been taken up by women. Today's results reflect a strong labour market and highlight the successes of the government's efforts to stimulate sustainable jobs growth. We continue to see record numbers of women employed in full-time work. In the most recent budget, the government announced a number of policies to further support women's economic capability and leadership. This includes $10 million for initiatives to put women in control of their financial lives as part of a $50 million fund to promote the financial capabilities of Australian consumers. And, of course, our new childcare package, which commenced from July this year, helps to support flexible work arrangements for more Australian families. We've introduced crucial flexibility measures that allow women with interrupted work patterns to make catch-up super contributions.

               Yes, I am. It's those opposite and their hypocritical approach to women's financial security. Labor say they want to boost women's economic security, yet they pledge to scrap measures the government has introduced to provide women with flexibility and security throughout their working lives and into retirement. They cosy up to militant unions and their extreme policies. The real consequence of Labor policies, if they are elected, is that they will cost jobs and close small businesses, and this would particularly affect regional Australians who are doing it tough because of the drought. Worst of all, they continue to stand up to the—

                 Thank you. There is a breathtaking cash grab which hurts the hip pockets of around 900,000 Australians and hits 30 per cent more women than men. Maybe, once they've seen sense and abandoned their dangerous proposal, we will take those opposite seriously when they say they're concerned about women's economic security. You're all talk.
