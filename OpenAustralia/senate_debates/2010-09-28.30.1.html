        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate record its deep sorrow at the deaths of Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale and Private Grant Kirby, and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of their service to our country and tender its profound sympathy to their families and friends in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senators and all Australians would be aware of the loss of these five Australian defence personnel since the Senate last met. Their service has been acknowledged. The funerals have occurred and due respect has been shown, but we think it is important that the Senate formally record its appreciation of their service and extend our sympathies to the families, friends and defence colleagues of those five Australian soldiers. We have seen significant loss of personnel in Afghanistan, 21 in total, but obviously these most recent five losses bring home the sacrifice and commitment of our defence personnel and the risks they take.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge, first of all, the loss of Private Nathan Bewes, who was 23. He joined the Army in 2005. On completion of his recruit and infantry basic training he was posted to the 6th Battalion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        , in Brisbane. Private Bewes completed a deployment to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        in 2006 and was on his second deployment with the First Mentoring Task Force in Afghanistan at the time of his death. To his parents, Gary and Kaye; to his sister, Stephanie; and to his partner, Alice Walsh, please accept our deepest sympathies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second person I want to place some remarks about on the record is Trooper Jason Brown. Jason was 29. He joined the Army in 2000. On completion of his recruit and infantry basic training he was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. In 2004 he joined the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, the Commandos. Trooper Brown became a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Special Air Service Regiment
        </a>
        after successfully completing that most searching selection course in 2007. He was deployed in June 2010 for the first time to Afghanistan as a member of the Special Operations Task Group. To Jason’s parents, Graham and Ann; and to his sister, Stephanie, our deepest sympathies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Private Tomas Dale was also killed in action. He was just 21. He joined the Army in 2007. After successfully completing his recruit and infantry basic training he was posted to the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. This was Private Dale’s first operational deployment. To his parents, Karen and David; and to his brothers, Samuel and Joe, our deepest sympathies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Private Grant Kirby was 35 when he was killed while serving his country. He joined the Army in 2006. After successfully completing his recruit and infantry basic training he was posted to the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. This was Private Kirby’s first deployment to Afghanistan. However, it was his second deployment to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        . He had previously been deployed to East Timor and Iraq. To his parents, Gary and Dianne, and Jo-Anne; his sister, Lauren; his brothers, Luke and Shaun; his former partner, Edwina; and his two daughters, Isabella and Madeleine, our deepest sympathies on your terrible loss.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to pay tribute to Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. He was 28 when he joined the Army in 2002 and in the same year he successfully completed his recruit training. In 2003 he completed his infantry training, prior to being posted to the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. This was his third deployment to the Middle East and his second to Afghanistan. I want to convey to his wife, Beckie; his daughter, Annabell; his son, Noah; his parents, Terry, Jane and Ian; and his siblings, Caleb, Jordan, Meg and Charlotte, our deep sympathies and condolences on his loss.
       </p>
       <p>
        These five men have been laid to rest, but it is important that we in the parliament acknowledge their sacrifice. We will remember these five men, each from different backgrounds, who came together to serve in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        and give to their country. They did so willingly, deliberately choosing to serve their country in what they knew was a dangerous mission.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government takes its responsibility in committing troops to combat very seriously—I know every member of this parliament takes that responsibility very seriously—and the burden of those decisions, the burden of knowing what we ask of our defence personnel and the risks that they take. The loss of life brings home the seriousness and the import of these decisions. We know that not every Australian or indeed every member of the parliament necessarily accepts the wisdom of our presence in Afghanistan. That is obviously part of our democracy: that people have different views about this. But I do know the parliament is united in paying its respects to those who serve us and in paying its respects to those who have lost their lives and expressing its sympathy to their families, friends and colleagues.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will shortly have a parliamentary debate on the subject of our ongoing involvement in Afghanistan. That is as it should be in a democracy; we ought to be able to debate these issues. I look forward to that debate because I think it will be useful to have proper consideration of all those issues. I am sure that will occur in the spirit of total support for our troops and recognition of the commitment they show. Obviously the government will argue that Australia’s mission to Afghanistan is essential for us to defeat the Taliban and the terrorist forces that are using it as a safe haven. As I say, we will have that debate in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we want to honour the courage of these men, and their 16 colleagues, who have given their lives in pursuit of this mission. We have, as I said earlier, lost 21 soldiers in Afghanistan—historically, a large loss. Those 21 men have paid the ultimate price for maintaining the security of this nation and the world. I would like to reinforce to their families our gratitude for the sacrifice they have also made. I think all of us who have seen the television coverage as well as those of us who have attended the funerals have been moved by the real, personal impact of these losses on families and friends. Seeing the children left behind by some of these men made a real impact on me and many other members of parliament. We know that the families have to share the burden of their loved one’s decision to serve in our Defence Force, and these families are obviously now suffering after the tragic loss that they have experienced.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know the magnitude of your loss, and the nation grieves with you. But you should take some comfort from knowing that this government and this parliament will continue to offer you their full support. Australia is deeply indebted to these five young men, and we acknowledge the tremendous sacrifice that they have made.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to note the tragic toll on the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, who have particularly suffered, having lost four of the five serving men who died recently—a huge hit to the 6th Battalion. We recognise their ongoing contribution and express our sympathies over what has been, I know, a terrible period for that very proud battalion.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the role of former defence minister Senator Faulkner in supporting the families of defence personnel. I think his commitment to those families and his support of them in their time of grief has been fantastic. There is a long tradition of defence ministers doing that, but I think his commitment has been quite obvious. I also acknowledge the continuing support of Senator Johnston and the opposition in this regard. I know Senator Faulkner took his role very seriously and had to bear the burden of those terrible losses. I know the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Chief of the Defence Force
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Houston" rel="nofollow">
         Angus Houston
        </a>
        , an outstanding Australian, also carries the burden of the loss of those men, who were ultimately under his command, and I know the whole of the Australian Defence Force mourns the loss of these men and feels it very deeply indeed. Minister Smith, the new Minister for Defence, will of course carry on supporting the defence forces in this way. We will ensure to every extent possible that our troops are supported in every way possible while they undertake this mission for the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I finish by saying that, clearly, the parliament will always acknowledge the courage and sacrifice of these five men. We acknowledge the suffering of their families but urge them to take great pride in the sacrifice offered by their loved ones. We record our appreciation of and our sympathy for their loss.

        <p>
         Over a seven-week period Australia, tragically, lost five of its finest on the battlefields of Afghanistan, bringing our casualty list numbers, sadly, to 21 since the conflict began in 2001. On 9 July we lost Private Nathan John Bewes. He was serving with the Brisbane based 6th Battalion Mentoring Taskforce 1 when he lost his life from an improvised explosive device. Nathan was born in Kogarah,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , in 1986. He joined the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Army
         </a>
         in 2005 and in the same year successfully completed his recruit and infantry basic training period prior to being posted to the 6th Battalion,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Regiment
         </a>
         . This was his third overseas deployment and his second to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Just a month later, on 13 August, we lost Trooper Jason Thomas Brown from the Perth based
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Special Air Service Regiment
         </a>
         . Jason was part of a combined Australian and Afghan patrol conducting operations in northern Kandahar at the time of the incident. His death was a very sad reminder of the dangers faced by our soldiers in Afghanistan on a daily, hour-by-hour basis and the risks that they take on behalf of our country to make Afghanistan a better place.
        </p>
        <p>
         Seven short days thereafter, on 20 August, we had the terrible news that two more Australian soldiers, Private Tomas Dale, 21, and Private Grant Kirby, 35, of the First Mentoring Task Force in Afghanistan were killed in action when they were struck by an improvised explosive device. Both soldiers were also from the Brisbane based 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. Tomas and Grant had dismounted from their Bushmaster protected mobility vehicle when they were fatally struck by the detonation of the explosive device. The deaths of Private Tomas Dale and Grant Kirby so soon after the recent death of Trooper Jason Brown was a stark and tragic reminder of the dangers and courageous work Australian defence personnel undertake every day in Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, further tragedy was to strike just three days later on 24 August when Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, also from the Brisbane based 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, was killed in a firefight with Taliban insurgents in the Tangi Valley. Jared joined the Air Force Cadets at Amberley as a youngster and was named most outstanding cadet before joining the Royal Australian Regiment. However, what makes Jared’s death even more pointed and tragic is that his wife, Beckie, gave birth to their second child on the very day of his funeral.
        </p>
        <p>
         I attended these gallant Australians’ funerals with my colleague Senator Faulkner; my leader,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Abbott
         </a>
         ; and the Prime Minister. I have to say that each and every one of them was an extremely sad, tragic, draining and emotional event. However, in every case, the mums, dads, brothers, sisters, friends and relations, in their eulogies, said how proud they were of their son or brother. They also said how committed each was to taking the fight up to the Taliban in Afghanistan because they overwhelmingly believed that they were fighting a just battle for a just cause.
        </p>
        <p>
         I share with senators our nation’s gratitude to these gallant Australians. Their contribution to our national security is forever acknowledged and be assured that they will be remembered by all Australians forever. On behalf of coalition senators, I offer heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of Private Bewes, Trooper Brown, Private Dale, Private Kirby and Lance Corporal MacKinney.

          I rise today to concur with the remarks of Senator Evans and Senator Johnston. Whilst we were going through an election, these people’s families have gone through a far greater turmoil with the loss of these loved and gallant men. It has also been an extremely bad time out at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoggera_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
           Enoggera Barracks
          </a>
          for the Brisbane based 6th Battalion,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">
           RAR
          </a>
          , losing four colleagues, and for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
           SAS
          </a>
          Regiment based in Perth.
         </p>
         <p>
          Without repeating the remarks on their service, these men and their families have paid the supreme sacrifice in the defence of our nation although not on our shores. Their lives were lost but not wasted. It is extremely important that our parliament continues to completely concur with the belief that their service was of ultimate worth in the protection of the people of Australia and that our forces seek out and close down the enemy on the enemy’s shores and not on ours.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, who was 28 years old and with so much of his life ahead of him, has paid the supreme sacrifice. The lives of Private Grant Kirby and Tomas Dale were taken by an improvised explosive device—such a cruel mechanism that has claimed a number of Australian lives. It requires absolute and incredible bravery for those people, who not only know the prospect of imminent danger but see it and know exactly what can happen to them if things go wrong, to go forward. They have recent recollections of colleagues who have been killed and yet these brave Australians continue to go forward despite these absolutely cruel and inhumane devices which, we have to acknowledge, if they do not kill soldiers then they kill children, they kill other people and they kill innocent bystanders.
         </p>
         <p>
          Trooper Jason Brown, who was also 29 years old and with so much of his life ahead of him, was a brilliant soldier and a member of the SAS. He was a person who had a great deal of pride in his position as a soldier. He saw himself as a warrior. As his father stated, he was a person who did not ask for acknowledgement; just respect for the service he gave. That is something that we are doing here right now. Private Nathan Bewes was another who was tragically killed by an improvised explosive device. All these people leave behind families, wives and children—tragically, Jared MacKinney did not meet his own child who was born on the day of his funeral.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is so important that we give recognition of the lives they laid down for our nation in a way that we cannot even hope to comprehend and we hope never to have to emulate. We hope that no-one in our family ever has to experience this. Yet these soldiers have done it on our behalf so that we do not have to do it. We must now acknowledge the pain and the grief that their families are suffering. That pain and grief will be a reminder to them every time they see a spare bedroom, every time they see a photo on the wall and every time they go through the cupboards and see the clothes of their former lovers, partners—people that they have known. This section of their life has been taken away. We must acknowledge those children growing up not having the experience of a father who can take them to the footy or cricket. Other people in their lives will now have to play those roles in proxy for their father that was lost.
         </p>
         <p>
          These are the ongoing sacrifices that these families make that go beyond the sacrifice that was made by the men who were killed. These sacrifices must be remembered in this chamber and they must be remembered by our nation. We must always honour their sacrifice because if they had not made that sacrifice then, within time, we would have had to make it on our shores.

           I join with other members in expressing the greatest and most unreserved sympathy for and empathy with the families, the loved ones, the battalion mates and comrades, and the communities who have lost these five brave Australians from their midst—Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. They have died in the service of this great nation and their courage and their sacrifice will be in the annals of the history of this nation forever.
          </p>
          <p>
           Their commitment has our unreserved respect. The loss now suffered by their families brings with it the unreserved sympathy of every member of this parliament. I hope that healing, as best it can, comes to their friends and loved ones so that life may get back on track and hope can be brought to future happiness for all those who are suffering now. These five young Australians have lost their lives so recently—since this Senate was last in session—and we hope their loved ones can move on and find future happiness avail again. Five brave young Australians are gone and our sympathy extends to all their loved ones.

            I also concur with the remarks that have been made in this condolence motion. Again, our heartfelt condolences, thoughts and prayers go to the families of Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. I think there is no greater sacrifice than laying down one’s life, and we have asked our soldiers to put themselves in harm’s way for the safety of our nation and the nation of Afghanistan. I think it is a big sacrifice and our hearts do go out to their families and our condolences as well.

             Since the parliament last met, since this Senate was last in session, five young Australians have lost their lives in Afghanistan, as we have heard—Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. They were fine young soldiers and brave young men. They were not only soldiers but also sons, brothers, partners, husbands and fathers.

             It is the responsibility of the government, as every senator in this chamber knows, to protect Australia and Australians. But, as always when Australia’s security is safeguarded by force of arms, the burden of hardship and danger is shouldered by our men and women in uniform and the cost is borne by their families, their friends and their loved ones.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have always had the greatest respect and admiration for the men and women of the ADF, a respect and admiration that grew during my time as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel in the Keating government. But I am sure that those of us who have had the honour to serve as Australia’s defence minister understand the particular sense of responsibility to the servicemen and women that role brings. One of the great privileges of serving as defence minister is the opportunity to meet so many of our serving soldiers, sailors and aircrew around the country and on deployment overseas. Their courage, their dedication to their country and their supreme professionalism, I can only say, has to be seen to be believed. Their dedication to their mates, their generosity of spirit and their very Australian trait of keeping their sense of humour in even the worst situations makes it unarguable that the spirit of Anzac is alive and well in our modern armed forces.
            </p>
            <p>
             They do a magnificent job here in Australia and protecting our interests overseas, often very far overseas. They and their families bear long separations, the dislocation of the posting cycle and the constant awareness that they are doing very dangerous work. They do this work on behalf of all of us, and we should remember that our own safety is guaranteed by men and women giving up their own. We can be confident that our own families will return home at the end of the day because thousands of soldiers spend so many months away from their families. Those families endure anxious days and nights so we can lead our lives without such fears. They live with the daily reality of war so we can live with the daily blessing of peace.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will not forget and none of us must ever forget the sacrifice of Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney in Afghanistan. I will never forget Private Benjamin Ranaudo, Sapper Jacob Moerland, Sapper Darren Smith, Private Timothy Aplin, Private Scott Palmer and Private Benjamin Chuck. I will never forget, as none of us should ever forget, the other 10 Australians who died in Afghanistan and the 150 who were wounded serving our nation there. Nor will I ever forget and nor must any of us ever forget those who have served and continue to serve our nation with such bravery.
