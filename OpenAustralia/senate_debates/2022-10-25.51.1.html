        I rise to ask a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Minister Wong.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        recently provided a fracking fact sheet in English, which was then translated in language into audio files and provided to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        communities. Providing this fact sheet was one of the recommendations of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        fracking inquiry. This misleading fact sheet was produced by a CSIRO division that is partially funded by the gas industry, which includes Origin and Santos, and it stated that methane 'may' play a role in climate change, when we know that it definitely plays a role. In fact, methane is 80 times more potent than
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
         CO2
        </a>
        , and at least 25 per cent of global warming is driven by methane from human actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        My question is: why are fossil fuel companies allowed to fund, in any proportion, divisions of a government agency—our scientific peak body, which is expected to provide independent advice—especially regarding a controversial topic that these companies have a direct interest in?

         Thank you, Senator Cox, for the question. I'm sure she's not surprised to know this is not necessarily something of which I have direct, first-hand knowledge. I haven't seen the fracking fact sheet to which she has referred. But if she is referring to the partial funding that she described to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         and industry partnerships, which I think has been in the media for some time, I would make the point that part of the mission of the CSIRO—which of course is an essential pillar of Australia's national science infrastructure and a great institution responsible for some enormous advances in research with very good liaison and engagement with members of the Australian community—is to work with industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         I don't know if what the senator is complaining about or—sorry, I wasn't trying to minimise it—referencing is one of the industry partnerships. If she wants to give me more information about that I will be very, very happy to provide that. But if this is a reaction to the CSIRO working with industry, we've taken the view in government, and I did as climate minister many years ago, that it is a good thing for those at the forefront of research, both into climate science and into the response to climate change—how we deal with it—to work closely with industry. Industry has to be part of the solution not just yelled at. In fact, where we have done well as a country on energy, where we have done well as a country on renewable energy, it has been where governments and industry have worked together and the regulatory structure has incentivised industry to do the right thing.

            I also add to some of the answer: I understand that the member for Lingiari has raised issues in relation to the Jizera program with Minister Husic and has indicated publicly that this matter has been rectified. I will ask my office to liaise with Minister Husic's office about this issue and see if I can provide a little more information about how that was resolved. But it's just been brought to my attention that Ms Scrymgour did raise this with Minister Husic.

                I'm happy to answer as best I can. In relation to the longstanding assertion from the Greens about energy and coal and gas projects, I make the point again that I have made on multiple occasions in this place: any such approvals would be subject to existing environmental and regulatory frameworks.

                  I know you want to get some political differentiation on this, but I would also make the point that this is not how the world deals with a global agreement to deal with climate change. The way the world deals with it is by ensuring that, over time, the use of fossil fuels and the use of technologies which are highly carbon polluting is reduced. We have signed up to an ambitious platform and we intend to deliver it.
