        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. I refer to reports today that the minister has granted $1.4 million from the Indigenous Advancement Strategy and Aboriginals Benefit Account funding to a Katherine-based non-Indigenous company, North Australian Rural Management Consultants, which has close links to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">

        . How many Indigenous people have been employed and how many Indigenous businesses have been assisted by the $1.4 million grant to North Australian Rural Management Consultants?

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS" rel="nofollow">
          IAS
         </a>
         funding that I have approved, and every IAS grant has been made in accordance with IAS guidelines. I'm actively transitioning IAS funds to the Indigenous organisations that deliver outcomes, and the number is significantly increasing. When I got the portfolio, 35 per cent of the IAS was given to Indigenous organisations. It's now 55 per cent. So we're doing pretty well. Over that period of time, there have been some remarkable outcomes. But from time to time there is a capacity for organisations like the

          Red Cross

          Really, I'm not sure that's what they're suggesting. To give a clear understanding of what NARMCO do, they're an organisation that do back-of-house accounting and business advice to Indigenous companies. Most of them say, 'Yes, I can do the work, but we're struggling. We're not quite big enough to have in-house.' So we have a business adviser service that provides the accounting services and advocacy services within an Indigenous business. All the reports that come to me are that they do a good job. This contract was provided over three years ago, and they do a remarkable job. There's an allegation that somehow there's a connection to whatever the inappropriate process is. I do note the reason I'm aware of NARMCO is that I became aware of an issue and I specifically asked them for a show cause as to how they were going to manage the possible perception of some interaction.

             . I was informed that he actually works for NARMCO and had been doing so for some time before that event. That is a perceived conflict. So, because this is the process of how you deal with conflicts, perceived or otherwise, we've written to the company and asked them: how are you going to manage that conflict or the perception of it? This is a process that is followed throughout these sorts of circumstances. I have been at pains to ensure that those processes are followed to the letter. We have followed those processes to the letter. The department has provided some advice about how these matters are dealt with, and I have dealt with this in exactly that way.

                What it does is assist the Indigenous companies creating the outcomes of 10 per cent of the 412,000 jobs we created last year. Three per cent of the population created 10 per cent of those jobs. They did it because we had organisations assisting them with areas where they don't have the capacity so that they can get the contracts. That's right: government contracts that went from $6.2 million under your government to over a billion dollars under ours—32 businesses under yours, over 1,000 under ours. That's why we're doing so well.
               </p>
               <p>
                But they have told us, 'We need help in some areas.' So, on the basis of advice to those companies—we don't trust them—they say, '
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
                 Can I
                </a>
                have some support from these organisations?' and we provide that support. Those organisations that provide the support are essential in building capacity so that these Aboriginal organisations, this one in particular, can access the economy.
