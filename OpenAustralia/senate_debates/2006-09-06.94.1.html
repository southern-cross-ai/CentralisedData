       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the report.

       <p>
        I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in

        Leave granted.

        The statement read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report examines the proposal to redevelop the Australian Institute of Police Management (AIPM) site on North Head, Manly. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $16.224 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AIPM is located on 1.7 hectares of harbour front land at the end of Collins Beach Road, Manly and has operated from this site since 1960. The AIPM provides senior management and executive development, education and consultancy services for Australasian and International law enforcement agencies and public safety agencies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Federal Police (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        ) submitted that the aim of the redevelopment is to improve the operational efficiency and long term sustainability of the AIPM, to expand the functional capacity and to modernise security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        According to the AFP the redevelopment will consist of:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         replacement of residential accommodation blocks, administrative and academic office accommodation and senior common room facilities;
        </li>
        <li>
         refurbishment of existing library, teaching, dining areas and specific heritage buildings;
        </li>
        <li>
         construction of soft and hard landscaping to various areas of the site including consolidation of car parking;
        </li>
        <li>
         removal of existing barrack style accommodation buildings and miscellaneous stores areas; and
        </li>
        <li>
         landscaping works to improve the environment for both humans and native fauna occupants of the site.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        On the second of June 2006 the Committee inspected the site and environs of the proposed works.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        also received a confidential briefing from the AFP and held a public hearing in Manly later that day. At the public hearing the Committee heard of large scale community concerns with the proposal, and acknowledges the receipt of a 366 signature petition opposing the works.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Much of the community concern relates to the culturally and environmentally sensitive nature of the site. The Committee feels that had the AFP undertaken to consult with the local community in a timely and transparent manner, and attempted to address these issues, much of the community concerns could have been alleviated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The site provides a habitat for a number of endangered populations; of particular importance are the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Penguin" rel="nofollow">
         Little Penguin
        </a>
        and long-nosed bandicoot populations. The whole of the North Head, which includes the AIPM site, was placed on the National Heritage List on 12 May 2006. As a result, any works that proceed on this site need to give consideration to the environmental and heritage impacts that they may have, and the current proposal has been referred to the Department of Environment and Heritage for its consideration. The Committee recommends that the AFP supply it, and the local council and community, with copies of the Construction Environment Management Plan, the Conservation Management Plan and the Traffic Management Plan once these plans have been formulated. These plans should alleviate many negative impacts that the redevelopment would have had on the site.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recognises the benefits of integrated management of the North Head. As a result, the Committee recommends that the AFP works with the Manly City Council, as well as other North Head stakeholders to ensure integrated management of the North Head.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the Hearing the Committee also heard of Community difficulty with accessing the 1979
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Use" rel="nofollow">
         Land Use
        </a>
        agreement, which allows the Commonwealth to use the site as a “police college” until such time as it is deemed to be surplus to Commonwealth requirements. The Committee is satisfied with the legal advice received by the AFP, and communicated to the Committee, that the Commonwealth retains control and administration of the site, and accepts the AFP’s preference for the 1979 Land Use agreement to be accessed through the NSW State Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The local community raised concerns that the redevelopment was commercially driven, and that potential existed for the site to be commercially let. The Committee questioned the AFP as to the extent of commercial use of the site, and was informed that commercial use amounted to 16 per cent of the total use. The Committee was assured that large scale commercialisation at the site would not occur.
       </p>

        , having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the Committee recommends that the Australian Institute of Police Management Redevelopment, North Head, Manly proceed at the estimated cost of $16.224 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In closing, I wish to thank those who assisted with the inspection and public hearing, my Committee colleagues, and staff.

       <p class="italic">
        I commend the report to the Senate.
