                   <p class="italic">
                    The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to referendums the writs for which are issued on or after the commencement of this Schedule.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    These government amendments seek to amend the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill 2022. In respect of the pamphlet, the bill will retain a requirement for the Electoral Commissioner to distribute an official 'yes' and 'no' pamphlet containing arguments for and against a proposal to alter the Constitutionâ€”authorised by parliamentariansâ€”to all enrolled Australian households. This change has been made following consultation, and it reflects a bipartisan approach to electoral reform.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In relation to the amendment to the expenditure restrictions in section 11(4) of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act, a decision to change our Constitution is a significant national event, and it has been more than two decades since a change has been proposed. In order to make an informed decision, the Australian people must have access to relevant information about our system of government. It is therefore important that the government can fund civics education activities in relation to the upcoming referendum on the Voice. To enable such activities to be funded, the bill temporarily suspends expenditure restrictions in section 11 of the referendum act.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    However, following further consultation, the government has decided to amend, rather than suspend, section 14(4). This amendment will leave the expenditure restrictions relating to funding 'yes' and 'no' arguments in place but will ensure that these restrictions do not prevent funding of neutral civics awareness activities to provide the information needed to ensure that all Australians can cast an informed vote. Neutral civics education activities are an important way to assist in combating misinformation about the Constitution, Australia's system of government and the referendum process.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Importantly, this amendment also ensures that the government can continue to support consultation with the Referendum Working Group, the Referendum Engagement Group and the Constitutional Expert Group. The referendum act does not provide for public funding of 'yes' or 'no' campaigns, and the government has confirmed on many occasions that it will not provide public funding for either a 'yes' or a 'no' campaign. These exemptions will automatically be repealed at the end of the current parliament.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    On the expansion of the mobile polling period, the government supports the committee's recommendation to strengthen opportunities for enfranchisement and participation in the referendum, particularly of Aboriginal and
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
                     Torres Strait Islander
                    </a>
                    people, including in remote communities. To support this outcome, the bill will expand the mobile polling period for referendums from 12 days to 19 days. Mobile polling is the primary voting mechanism for people living in remote locations. This will support the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                     Australian Electoral Commission
                    </a>
                    to conduct voting services in remote parts of Australia over an additional time period to increase participation and ensure that all voters have the chance to exercise their right and obligation to vote.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The government also made the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Enrolment Enfranchisement) Regulations 2023 to expand the forms of identification a voter is able to produce in order to enrol or update their enrolment to include Medicare numbers and Australian citizenship notice numbers. This will allow those individuals who have previously faced barriers to enrolment as a result of not having the required evidence of identification documents to participate in elections and referenda.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    On the broadcasting blackout, the bill will be amended to extend the broadcasting blackout period of political and election advertisements during referendums in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. This will ensure that there is consistency in the blackout of advertisements across television and radio in the three days prior to polling day access, consistent with arrangements for federal elections. Consequential amendments will also be made to the Special Broadcasting Services Act 1991 to extend this broadcasting blackout to the SBS.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    On scrutineers: scrutineers play a significant role in supporting the integrity of a referendum and trust in Australian democratic processes. The bill will be amended to align the number of persons that the Governor-General, state governors, chief ministers of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                     Australian Capital Territory
                    </a>
                    and the administrator of the Northern Territory may appoint as scrutineers at a counting centre during the counting process, with the entitlement of registered political parties. This will support public confidence in the outcome of a referendum and is consistent with the entitlements of registered political parties.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    On the issue of the disclosure threshold indexation, the bill introduces a transitional provision to freeze the financial disclosure threshold from the time the bill commences until the next general federal election. This will mean that the referendum entities and donors can have certainty that the disclosure threshold for this referendum will be $15,200.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Finally, Australia's electoral system is one of which we can be proud. This bill will modernise the legislation that will govern how this referendum will be conducted. The bill will advance the Prime Minister's commitment to hold a referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Constitution through a voice to parliament. I commend this bill to the Senate.

                       I rise to make some comments in relation to the Greens' position on the government amendments. As we said earlier this week, we will be supporting this bill. We support modernising the conduct of referenda and, in particular, we want the Voice referendum to succeed.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In relation to the government amendments which have been moved together: we're comfortable with the most recent amendment, which clarifies that the civics campaign will not be a de facto 'yes' or 'no' campaign but will be a neutral campaign. So we're happy to support
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QE" rel="nofollow">
                        QE
                       </a>
                       100. But we note that there's a real need for truth in political advertising law and that, in fact, that should also have been addressed in this bill. There will be some amendments by our crossbench colleagues in relation to the drafting of the pamphlet, which we'll support, but the Greens' position remains that we want truth in political advertising laws, which we have advocated for for decades now and which we'll continue to pursue that through various other means.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       We strongly support the extension of remote mobile polling from 12 to 19 days. Too many voters in the 2022 election, particularly those in remote areas, were effectively disenfranchised because the remote mobile-polling services didn't actually make it to their communities. Bad weather, large distances, mechanical issues and limited resources meant that some remote communities were only visited for a few hours by those remote-polling units and that some missed out altogether. We heard about poor communications, meaning that people didn't know when the polling station would be in town. It's clear that we need to do better, and I welcome this amendment to extend the remote-polling period from 12 to 19 days as an important step.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I note that in the recent JSCEM hearing, the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
                        AEC
                       </a>
                       responded to some questions from me by confirming it was aiming to attend 100 remote areas during the referendum polling on the basis of the extension that the government has proposed. But I also want to note that it will be critical to make sure that referendum material is available in language and that interpreters are available at polling places for the duration of their time in the community. We need to facilitate people in remote areas participating actively in our democracy, and having the information they need to do that. This referendum is the perfect place to start that.

                       150 prevents the indexation of the disclosure threshold; that's uncontroversial, so we support that. But we note that we have an amendment, which I'll move shortly, to lower the disclosure threshold to $1,000. People have a right to know who is funding what, not just in elections but also in referenda. Whilst we support the decision not to allow indexation to occur, we think that $15,200 is too high a threshold. People actually want to know that information, and they deserve to know it. I note that Senator David Pocock has an amendment to one of the amendments the government has moved, the effect of which would be to extend the media blackout to include social media. I'm flagging that even though it hasn't been movedâ€”although I imagine that's imminentâ€”the Greens will support it. And I'll have quite a lot more to say when it comes to our amendments, because this is a crucial opportunity to enfranchise as many people as possible.

                       This is an important referendum; it has been a long time since we've had one, and these are weighty decisions. We should be maximising the participation of people in having their voice heard. It's somewhat ironic that the amendments the Greens will move to allow on-the-day enrolment will not, I believe, be supported by the government or the opposition. I say 'ironic', because we are having a referendum about having the Voice and yet they won't allow people to have a voice about having a voice by having this insurance policy of allowing on-the-day enrolment. I will speak about that when the time comes but I would urge others in the chamber to reconsider their opposition to that, because we can't wait. Voting is a right, it's not a privilege, and we should maximise participation by allowing on-the-day enrolment.

                        I have a question for the minister about Commonwealth expenditure. I would like an explanation about the constitutional expert groupâ€”the Referendum Engagement Group or the Referendum Working Group. I understand they are all 'yes' voters and 'yes' people. So if the government are paying for 'yes' people on their engagement group and their working group who are going around selling their song sheet and singing from their song sheet, then where is the accountability and transparency in paying those 'yes' people to say yes?

                          Excuse me for my ignorance and for not understanding this, but I thought there was no money for a 'yes' campaign and a 'no' campaign, so why are you paying people to say yes and, in fact, bully blackfellas out there to say yes as well? How much money are these people being paid to say yes to you and to allow the assimilation of black people into the Constitution?

                             No, it's not the intention of the government to include those groups in this particular process, but any organisation in this country is free to express their point of view, either yes or no, in terms of the referendum. The great thing about Australia is that we are a democracy. People have the right to express yes or no. The whole point of the referendum is asking the Australian people what they think about this constitutional change. We heard earlier from particularly many of the coalition speakers on this topic just how difficult it is to pass a constitutional amendment in this country. The requirement is that you have four of the six states voting in favour at least and then a majority of Australians voting in favour. So it's a difficult hurdle to get over. The government supports the Voice. I'm very clear on that. And of course we have a couple of colleagues in the chamber have been very actively engaged in the process, Senator Dodson and

We've had no response, and there has been no opportunity for black sovereigns in this country to have a conversation about their future. I don't understand the transparency and accountability if you're only paying 'yes' blackfellas and not allowing the progressive 'no' blackfellas even a seat at the table. I don't see the transparency and accountabilityâ€”or fairness, to be precise. Can you explain that to the black sovereign movement watching today, who have been denied a seat at the table? They've asked the Prime Minister to have a conversation, and only 'yes' people are being paid at this point in time by your government, because it's your agenda.

                               , for your question. I can't say much more, in honesty, than I said in answer to your previous question. These groupsâ€”and I don't accept your categorisation of them as simply being 'yes' peopleâ€”are there to give government advice on the best way of achieving an Indigenous voice to parliament. That's the purpose. The objective is not to give the government advice on how not to do that, which is what I think you are asking to do.
                              </p>

                               You may not like the position that the federal government has taken on the Voice, but we are the government. We are entitled to present the position that we took to the Australian people at the last election in support of an Indigenous voice to parliament. And that is exactly what we're doing. It is appropriate that the people who are giving us that advice are treated in the way that this bill seeks to. That is their job. That's what they're doing. They're doing a very good job. Constitutional change is not easy in this country, Senator Thorpe. I, personally, support the Voice to Parliament. My home state of

I don't want them to vote no; I want them to vote yes. This group has been working tirelessly to make sure that happens. That's the intention of the government.

                                  Thank you, Minister, for your lovely whitesplaining of how good this assimilation policy will be and how good the upcoming assimilation referendum for a powerless Voice will be. We're used to that. We've been putting up with that for over 200 years. I won't be supporting this particular amendment. I think it's just a secure way for the government to pay their 'yes' people to provide the 'yes sir; no sir' tokenistic gesture that, unfortunately, many, many advisory bodiesâ€”which government themselves hand-pickâ€”do to us all the time. On behalf of the black sovereign movement, we won't be allowing 'yes' people to get paid any more than they already are to sell us out.

                                    I thank Senator Pocock for his engagement over this period, which we very much appreciate, but the government will not be supporting this particular amendment. While we do appreciate that the world has changed since that first broadcasting ban was introduced, and social media is a feature of modern-day communication, the objective of all of these changes to the referendum act is to try to ensure that Australian people have the same experience in this upcoming referendum as they would in a general election. Why is that necessary? The last referendum was more than 22 years ago. We've made a whole series of changes to the electoral act. We need to make sure that those experiences are now the same. Like it or not, there is currently no ban on social media in a federal election. There is a ban on other forms of media. All we're trying to do is link the normal processes that would apply in a federal election and make sure that they apply to a referendum.

There are a whole lot of changes that the government intends to make to the way in which we conduct federal elections in this country, but this is not the time to move this particular amendment. The time to deal with that issue will be when JSCEM is considering how we need to update our electoral laws. There will be plenty of time to deal with that in the weeks and months ahead, and I welcome your contribution to those processes.

                                     Thank you, Minister, for the explanation. Minister, can you give the Senate a guarantee that once that JSCEM review is tabled, should a social media blackout be part of that, that that will be brought before parliament to ensure that the referendum isn't disadvantaged? I really don't believe that the referendum should have to put up with a potentially huge amount of advertising in the few days before Australians go to vote on this very important issue just because we haven't kept up with electoral reform. We're not reflecting in our laws what I think is an expectation from the community. Social media now is a very legitimate advertising channel; in fact, millions and millions of dollars are spent on social media advertising. It seems that, rather than getting ahead, it is common sense to bring this up to date.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     I accept your reason that you don't want this to be ahead of JSCEM, but, should JSCEM before the referendum conclude that social media should be included, will the government seek to address this before the referendum?

                                      I thank Senator Pocock for what is a very sensible question. We will participate, like you will have the chance to, in the JSCEM processes. The issue is more complicated with social media. I will make this observation about social mediaâ€”and there might be people in the parliament that disagree with my assessment of it. A person who looks at a particular social media site for their news is more likely to be a person who agrees with that particular social media point of view that's being projected. One of the problems with modern forms of communication, like social media, is that you're often only getting the news that you want to hear. In a sense, social media is different from, for instance, an advertisement in the middle of the nightly news.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Look at the way in which people form judgements and views. The most significant influence in a decision to change your mind about a particular issue is what you see on the evening television news, and that hasn't really changed very much over the years. You can go down the list of all the ways in which you can communicate. Of course, the one at the bottom, interestingly enough, is Twitter. Twitter is a source of information that makes virtually nobody changing their minds. No-one who is listening to your Twitter feed at the moment, if you've got oneâ€”I don't happen to have oneâ€”is going to change their mind about anything that they hear on Twitter.

                                     <p>
                                      I think there are different considerations, and I'm not pre-empting what JSCEM is going to do. I'm happy if they discuss this issue, because I think it's an important issue. My only point is that the whole purpose of this particular bill is to ensure that we have common treatment between referenda and general elections. That's what this bill does, and we appreciate the support for ensuring that blackout period; but, for any further changes, let's see what JSCEM comes up with. I am not going to pre-empt any decision that they might make.

                                       Thank you, Minister, for the explanation. I am in no way suggesting that people's views be curtailed on social media, but there is a huge amount of advertising on Meta, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. I haven't seen the research that you cite, but it makes no sense to me to include all of these other advertising mediums and then not to include social media. I take your point on not wanting to be ahead and waiting for JSCEM, but, if JSCEM says social media should be included in the blackout period and that is before the referendum, will the government include that? I don't see why we should disadvantage the referendum and risk having advertising that really can't be scrutinised given that a lot of the ads on social media are dark ads. They're not visible to everyone. They're being served to people individually, and there is not a lot of transparency, but we know that political advertising on social media is well regulated, so it is fairly simple for the social media companies to simply not allow political ads in those last few days.

I'm not disagreeing that this is an important topic. It is a modern form of communication that we'll need to look at. The issue is complex. It's more complex because you're dealing with the internet and a range of other issues about how people can avoid having information delivered to them. The issue will be discussed by JSCEM. They will come up with a considered view on that. Let's have a look at what that view is.

In relation to proposed section 109E, can you confirm that referendum entities are only required to disclose donations that they receive in the six months prior to the referendum? Will any disclosure be required for donations made earlier if the funds are spent during the referendum period? Thanks for clarifying that.

                                           So just for clarity: if the donation is received prior to the six months and is spent during the six months, it is not subject to the disclosure requirements; is that correct?

                                             Now that there have been a number of amendments moved I thought I should put the opposition's position on each of them. I'll start with your amendment, Senator David Pocock. The opposition notes the views of Senator David Pocock on the blackout, but the opposition believes that the blackout period as imposed by the government amendment on sheet
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZB" rel="nofollow">

                                             195 should apply, as it does to other electoral events, such as federal elections. To expand the application of this would set a precedent that has not yet been fully investigated, as Minister

                                             explained. Any expansion of the blackout period should be subject to the proper processes, including consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, before the parliament can consider it effectively. So the opposition will be opposing this amendment.

                                             I turn to the government's other amendments. The amendment on sheet

                                             149 is around the number of scrutineers. The opposition's position is to support that amendment because of the need to ensure that an appropriate number of scrutineers can be appointed to provide the additional assurance that referenda can be conducted with the appropriate level of integrity. We would note, however, that this does not address the issue of how scrutineers will be appointed by formal or informal 'yes' and 'no' campaign organisations and how to ensure each side has the adequate number of scrutineers or indeed how scrutineers behave and report back the information that they are seeing at voting places.

                                             The opposition will be supporting the government's amendment around pausing the indexation event for the donation disclosure amount for the period of the referendum. It's a sensible step to ensure that participants who may be caught by donation activity prior to the referendum will have the same regulatory amount regardless of when they donate.

                                             We'll be supporting too the government's amendment that creates an advertising blackout for the referendum, in line with the blackout that applies during Commonwealth elections. We've said that this referendum should be similarâ€”as close as possibleâ€”to other electoral events so that participants have some familiarity with the way that it will be conducted. This is a good addition to the billâ€”to ensure that the blackout period which applies to federal elections also applies to the referendum.

                                             Finally, the opposition will be supporting the government's amendment to allow for the extension of remote area mobile polling activitiesâ€”

                                             refers to themâ€”for the purposes of referendums, with the pre-poll locations, in addition to remote area mobile polling locations, operating earlier than the prescribed pre-poll period. We think this, too, is a sensible measure that will take into account the potential for adverse weather events, particularly during the wet season, which may delay the access of those RAMP teams to remote communities. We are very conscious that the RAMP teams service many remote and many Indigenous communities, and every effort should be made for those communities to be provided with the opportunity to cast their ballots in a referendum.

                                             I also have a couple of questions around AEC resourcing. This is going to be a referendum which, unusually, isâ€”I think the phrase that you've used, Minister Farrell, and also that the Prime Minister has usedâ€”going to be driven by civil society. Civil society is going to be able to run and manage their own campaigns, whether they be for 'yes' or whether they be for 'no'. From the opposition's perspective, this creates some risks. While it sounds like a terrific proposition, it is very different from the way we run federal elections, with registered political parties that are responsible for maintaining the integrity structure around those electionsâ€”for instance, around foreign donation laws, donation caps and foreign interference laws. All of that is run within the sphere of registered political parties.

                                            <p>
                                             When you turn a referendum over to civil society, you are going to be dealing with a whole new raft of organisations that have never, potentially, dealt with the political process before, and that opens up the system, the referendum and the electoral process to some risks. The opposition would like some assurances from the government as to how those risks will be managed. Is the government going to resource, for instance, the

They know what their job is, and I'm sure that's exactly what they're going to do. They're very focused on the referendum.

Is this something that you have spoken about to the AEC? And, if you have, what has been their response? I should put a caveat on that to say that in no way is the opposition casting aspersions on the professionalism of the AEC. We feel that the AEC does an exceptional job at federal elections. The problem is this: we are concerned that because of the way this referendum is going to be run, the AEC has one hand tied behind its back. So we want to understand what the government is doing to ensure that is not the case.

From the opposition's perspective, this is exactly the reason why we have requested official 'yes' and 'no' campaignsâ€”to maintain the structural integrity around the referendum so that Australians know that those donation laws have been applied, that the organisations have complied, that foreign interference is limited and that foreign donations are banned. This is simply an impossible thing to manage and oversee unless there is either official 'yes' and 'no' campaigns or, at the very least, a register of organisations that the AEC and our intelligence agencies can go to to make sure that these organisations are complying with these very laws.

I happen to know one of the reasons the AEC were in the building yesterday is that they were doing exactly that with one member of parliament who did have some concerns not in relation to this issue but on more general issues. I'm happy to facilitate any discussion that you might have. If you have concerns about how the AEC are going to conduct this referendum, I'm happy for the AEC to make themselves available to answer those questions and, in a sense, put your mind at rest that this is going to be a professionally conducted referendum.

This comprises $50.2 million in 2022-23 for the Australian Electoral Commission to commence preparations to deliver the referendum, $1.6 million over two years from 2022-23 for the Attorney-General's Department and $0.8 million for two years from 2022-23 for the

The details will be announced in the 2023-24 budget. The final cost will be settled in the 2023-24 budget, as you would expect.

If there were any issues that I needed to be made aware of, I'm sure the AEC would have done that. As I said, I was in conversation with the commissioner only yesterday afternoon. He certainly didn't raise with me any issues in relation to foreign interference.

We don't want any foreign interference in this referendum. We want it to be about the Australian people and we want it to be the Australian people, and not foreign entities, who make the ultimate decision about whether or not we have a Voice to Parliament.

The government should be able to provide some information about the advice it has received, or sought, on the risk of foreign interference, given that the government has publicly speculated about it.

The head of the AEC also supported provisional voting and said strongly that he supported provisional voting on the day. What is the problem with that? I understand there's some racism around why only Aboriginal people are being stopped from voting on the day. I've been hearing that the reason could be voter fraudâ€”we don't want blackfellas being fraudulent towards the voting system. Why won't the government allow enrolment and voting on the day, as the head of the AEC has suggested and supported?
