        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Gallagher. When will the government name the former Australian politician that

         I thank Senator Roberts for the question, and I note the annual threat assessment that was delivered last night by the director-general of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         . We have utmost confidence in our security and intelligence services. The director-general made a comment about this. He was specifically asked about this last night. He said he'd made a deliberate decision not to name the individual, and he provided reasons for this. The government respects his judgement. He has our 100 per cent support. He has the full picture, and he made an informed decision.
        </p>
        <p>
         The threat assessment made clear that we need to continue to be vigilant and sober in how we respond to threats, and this is what we are doing. The annual threat assessment is an assessment made by ASIO. It is delivered by the director-general of that organisation. It's not something that the government authors. It's a document that is very much the director-general's and ASIO's, and he has all the information available to him. He made a decision about that. If that decision changes, that's his decision as well. It is not a decision for the government to make.

           Former parliamentarians, as I understand it, have an automatic pass to enter
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
            Parliament House
           </a>
           . The former politician who sold out this country could be in this building right now, in a parliamentarian's office, and the office holder, MP or senator, would have no idea they're talking to a spy. Why won't you name the traitor now?

             Well, it is. Sorry, but it's not a matter that the government is responsible for. In relation to the question you asked, which was about naming an individual, it's a matter for the director-general of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
              ASIO
             </a>
             . If he were to choose to name an individual, that would be a matter for him. As part of his annual threat assessment, he made a decision to raise the issue, I think, and to rightly point to the fact that foreign interference is an issue. It's an issue that all of us, as members of parliament, need to be aware of—

                I'm not sure of the question really. We talk about China all the time as a government. We've been seeking to stabilise the relationship. We've been seeking to remove some of the trade bans. But we've also been very clear that we must disagree where we do, and, where we can agree, we should reach agreement. But there are things that are in our national interests that we may disagree on, and then we will be upfront about that. We will always act in our country's national interest. That's what we've done from the first day we were appointed and it's what we will continue to do. That's what guides us in relation to our interactions and our work across the world. There are a number of countries that we engage with regularly, but it's always in our national interest that we do that.
