        As a servant to the many different people who make up our one Queensland community, I draw the Senate's attention to

         C40 Cities
        </a>
        , another campaign, from predatory billionaires who run the world, to destroy our standard of living and steal everything we own for themselves—all in the name of saving the planet. C40 Cities is a product of the usual suspects—billionaires

        As he calls on the world's governments to do more on climate change, Michael Bloomberg is doing the opposite. In 2022, he made 702 flights in his five jets, covering 810,000 kilometres, burning 1.2 million litres of jet fuel, and, for those who are counting, producing 3,200 tons of carbon dioxide. Bloomberg's No. 1 destination was not the Sudan or Afghanistan, where his money might actually help people; his favourite destination was the Bahamas.

        Here are the top end C40 targets for 2030, just seven years away. There's cutting steel and cement use 56 per cent. There's increasing the number of people in each building 20 per cent—and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">

        governor recently made a similar comment. There's eliminating—yes, eliminating!—meat consumption and dairy consumption. There's limiting buying new clothes to three new items a year—three; that's three pairs of undies. Food waste is to be reduced 75 per cent, mostly from homes. We'll shop once a week, buy our allocated ration from bulk displays and eat everything we buy or starve until our next allocated shopping day. There'll be programmable digital currency to ensure compliance.

        These rules are for you, for us, not for the elites and their nomenklatura, their henchmen in the media, academia, the bureaucracy and politics. The rules never apply to the people who make them.
