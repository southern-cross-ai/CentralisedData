         This must be an important speech because I have actually made a few written notes and somebody just said to me that I have actually combed my hair! Today I make my farewell speech to the Senate—a fond farewell after 17 years—a farewell with few regrets and no complaints. It has certainly been a privilege to have served in the parliament of this great nation. I am also extremely fortunate. I am leaving on my own terms with new challenges and opportunities ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are families today who are not so fortunate. There are families and friends grieving at the loss of their loved ones who recently died tragically in Afghanistan in the service of their country. We noted their passing today. They have paid the ultimate price and made the ultimate sacrifice for the democratic values and life that we enjoy and that we here in this parliament are sworn to uphold. I honour them for their courage and I extend my sincere condolences to their families.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I made my first speech on 29 June 1994, I stated:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … it is our primary task in the parliament to ensure that people enjoy a free, peaceful, democratic society; that they live in a clean, safe environment; that they have access to adequate health care, education, employment opportunities, security in retirement and a decent standard of living. I am pleased to be part of a government and of a party that continues to pursue and deliver these objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
         I said those words 17 years ago and I still believe them to be true. I came into this place when the Labor government was in power and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
          Paul Keating
         </a>
         was Prime Minister. I leave at the end of this month with Labor again in government and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
          Julia Gillard
         </a>
         as Prime Minister. The years in between have certainly never been dull, I have seen the highs and lows of political fortune. I was here for the last two years of the Keating government, from May 1994 until that devastating defeat in March 1996. I was here during the long years of opposition, from March 1996 until our return to government in November 2007, led by former Prime Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
          Kevin Rudd
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Each of these Labor governments can claim credit for substantial achievements. In my first speech I made mention of the Hawke and Keating governments' great advance in extending superannuation to the entire Australian workforce. I am pleased and proud to have been a part of that development during my days with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Workers Union
         </a>
         . This is a lasting achievement as the level of accumulated funds today approaches $2 trillion, guaranteeing that all Australians and their families will in the future have a decent retirement income. It has grown from $200 billion when I entered the Senate in 1994. I also note that the most successful funds, particularly those who have succeeded during the recent financial crisis, have been the industry based funds, those funds developed by the union movement and industry over 20 years ago. I urge the government to work towards increasing the current superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to the target figure of 15 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another achievement of the Hawke and then Keating government was the establishment of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
          APEC
         </a>
         and the increasing engagement with Asia. Those governments drove it and today we enjoy the continuing economic benefits of that relationship particularly with the major economies of China, India and Korea.
        </p>
        <p>
         Almost 12 years of my time in this place was spent in opposition. At times, quite often, they were dispiriting days when we spent many hours in this chamber endeavouring to hold the government to account.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          The Senate
         </a>
         in those days, I believe, performed exceptionally well and I think the opposition particularly held the government to account. I recall not long after I arrived meeting the great
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Daly" rel="nofollow">
          Fred Daly
         </a>
         as he escorted visitors on a tour of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         . Fred would stop when he saw me and say to the people that he was showing around the building, 'Ladies and gentlemen, meet an example of life after death—meet a senator.' I have been friends with the Daly family for many years and I know that Fred said that in jest—or maybe—because, as we all know, Fred had a long career in the other place. With the events of 1975, he certainly took a dim view of the Senate, a view that is often reflected in the other place. But we were a constructive opposition here in the Senate. We were effective, we were united and we held the Howard government to account. We fought for the principles that we believed in. We supported legislation that we believed was appropriate and we opposed that which we believed was not.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to pay particular tribute here today to the leadership, firstly, of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Faulkner" rel="nofollow">
          John Faulkner
         </a>
         and then
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans" rel="nofollow">
          Chris Evans
         </a>
         during those long years in opposition. My major disappointment in all that time in opposition is that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">
          Kim Beazley
         </a>
         never achieved the election victory I believe he deserved. Kim was an excellent parliamentarian, minister and Deputy Prime Minister. He was a wonderful person with a great passion for Australia. I firmly believe he would have made a great Prime Minister. He almost achieved that in 1998 against huge odds, achieving a majority of the votes but, unfortunately, not a majority of the seats. And in 2001 he was thwarted by, firstly, the
         <i>
          Tampa
         </i>
         crisis and the misleading campaign which surrounded that incident, and, subsequently, by the impact of the terrorist attacks on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
          New York
         </a>
         on September 11.
        </p>
        <p>
         The hardest decision I ever made in the parliament was in 2006 when I supported a change in the leadership of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         from Kim Beazley to Kevin Rudd. It was the right decision for the party at the time, but it is a decision I made with great sadness because Kim was a good friend. I hope he has forgiven me. He is doing us proud as Ambassador to the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the years to come the Rudd gov­ern­ment's achievements will be remembered—in particular, the economic stimulus package, the establishment of the G20, the apology to the stolen generations and the expansion of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_Summit" rel="nofollow">
          East Asia Summit
         </a>
         . These are some of the great achievements and I believe there will be more recognised in time to come. I thank Kevin Rudd for leading us out of the political wilderness—and I spent 12 years in this building in it. I think Kevin Rudd's leadership in the 2007 campaign, along with Julia Gillard, was exceptional.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is the only advanced country that avoided a recession during the global financial crisis. Indeed, we were so successful that many people now doubt that the situation was as serious as first thought. Well, it was. You only have to look at the problems that confront the United States and countries in Europe such as Ireland, Greece and Portugal to see just how serious the crisis was, and still is, for much of the Western world.
        </p>
        <p>
         A major component of the economic stimulus package of the Rudd government was the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
          Building the Education Revolution
         </a>
         program. It has been attacked constantly by the media shock jocks and indeed the coalition. I have had the honour of visiting many schools both in Sydney and in regional and rural
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         to open
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">
          BER
         </a>
         facilities. Government schools, nongovern­ment schools, schools in the Catholic system, independent schools, small schools, large schools—in every case the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Principals and parents groups say to me that they would have waited 20 or 30 years for these facilities. They may have even waited forever to receive the new classrooms, the assembly halls, the toilet blocks, the covered outdoor learning areas, the smart boards, the canteens and so on. Teachers, students and community representatives are absolutely delighted by the new facilities at their schools. They have nothing but praise for the BER. I do not deny that there have been problems. After all, has anyone ever built a house and not had some problem with the architect or the builder? Well, we have been building 24,000 projects against across 9,000 schools. The BER is a fantastic program that will have lasting benefits for our education system for generations to come. And what could be a more important objective than the education of our young Australians?
        </p>
        <p>
         I should admit that I have one other regret in my time in the Senate, and that is that I did not make it onto the frontbench except as a shadow parliamentary secretary. Actually, I was selected for the opposition frontbench after the 1996 election—there were not many of us around so the competition was not so great. I was selected by my colleagues in the New South Wales Right, but then I agreed to give up my spot for someone else and in the interests of affirmative action. In hindsight it was not my smartest-ever decision. But I was rewarded—I became caucus returning officer! And I still am. By the time we came to office in 2007, the opportunity to serve on the frontbench had passed, and I had decided by that time that this was going to be my last term.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not everyone can be a minister—some of us have to fill up the back seats here—but we all do important work. Over the past 17 years I have worked on many committees of the Senate and joint committees. In fact, there are not many committees that I have not been a member of at some stage. When I first arrived in the building—I was a casual replacement at the time—the whip at the time,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Jones" rel="nofollow">
          Gerry Jones
         </a>
         , asked me what I was interested in. I replied, 'Industrial relations, education, foreign affairs, health—any of those will do.' And he put me on Scrutiny of Bills! Don't get me wrong, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is a very important committee, and I learnt much about the legislative process in the three years that I was a member of it. It was where I began a great friendship with the one and only Senator Barney Cooney, one of the true gentlemen of this chamber. Since then I have been privileged to be the chair of a number of Senate committees—the Senate foreign affairs committee, the Senate Finance and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Administration_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Public Administration Committee
         </a>
         and the Senate select committee on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Heights" rel="nofollow">
          Lucas Heights
         </a>
         reactor. I think I got that one because I live very close to it. I have lost count of the number of inquiries I have participated in—there are so many—but I mention in particular the inquiries into mental health, Medicare, consular services, the F111, dairy deregulation and the Regional Partnerships program as being some of the more important and most memorable. I am particularly proud of the fact that, following the report of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Select Committee
         </a>
         on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Mental Health
         </a>
         , the Howard government and more recently the Gillard government substantially increased funding to mental health services. I know firsthand the impact that mental illness can have on people and their families and I urge this government and all future governments to continue to increase funding for those people most in need.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since we returned to government in 2007 it has been my special privilege to have chaired the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and also to have been a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Joint Committee
         </a>
         on Intelligence and Security, both extremely important committees of the parliament. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is the largest committee of the parliament and is the one that most members of parliament aspire to be a member of.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has had a major role to play in international affairs, both in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
          Asia Pacific
         </a>
         region and also more broadly. We can be proud of our role over many years, particularly since World War
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
          II
         </a>
         when the Labor governments of Curtin and Chifley did so much to defend democracy and subsequently to promote peace, security and development. The world has changed substantially since I arrived in 1994. Some of it has been for the better, such as the economic development in Asia and the growing movement we now see towards democracy in north Africa. However much of it has been for the worse, particularly the increased threat of terrorism, increased poverty, the denial of human rights, the genocide that continues unfortunately in a number of states and is sponsored by those states, and the continuing failure to resolve longstanding disputes in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         and Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this parliament we will not always agree on foreign policy—Iraq was a stark example of that—but we must all have a common objective to promote Australia's interests internationally. That is why I strongly support our campaign for membership of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         Security Council. If we want to be in the game, if we want our voice to be heard internationally, if we want to promote reform of the United Nations rather than just criticise it or talk about it or complain about it, we should aim for the First 15: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Security Council. As I leave the parliament, the government faces major economic and environmental challenges. I wish everyone, on all sides, well in the debates and in the decisions they will make on these important issues in the coming months and years.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are so many people to thank and so little time. Firstly, I thank my party for having given me the opportunity to serve in the Senate and I thank the people of New South Wales for re-electing me on two occasions, from the No. 3 spot. It is not always easy, but I had some smart people working out the preference arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Senate staff are some of the most professional people I have ever met in my long career. I thank particularly clerks
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Evans" rel="nofollow">
          Harry Evans
         </a>
         , Rosemary Laing and Cleaver Elliot. They were always instantly available to provide advice. I also thank Peter and Angie and the team in the Table Office. My office is located directly opposite the Table Office. I moved there 10 to 12 years ago and every time they offered me a new office I refused to go because the Table Office is one of the places in this building that we have come to rely on so much. I also thank Brett and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
          IT
         </a>
         staff—like John Faulkner, I am hopeless at computers so I relied on them a lot as well. Thanks also to the attendants and security staff.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you particularly to all the staff of the committees I have worked on and been a member of over the years. There are so many that I cannot mention them all, but I do particularly want to acknowledge a former secretary of a committee, Alistair Sands. I worked closely with Alistair Sands on the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee for a long time and he was one of the best. I particularly mention
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Lynch" rel="nofollow">
          Anne Lynch
         </a>
         and Neil Bessel, two wonderful people, two great servants of the Senate, who sadly passed away far too early. To my mate, Ian, in the Senate Transport Office: thanks, mate, particularly for sending those cars late at night when I was busy working on my speeches. Hopefully, Ian, we will get a round of golf soon.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I arrived in this building I was fortunate to have many friends who were already here and I have made many new ones along the way; I cannot mention them all. Many of them have been on the other side of the chamber. I do want to particularly single out Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Ferguson" rel="nofollow">
          Alan Ferguson
         </a>
         .
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_and_I" rel="nofollow">
          He and I
         </a>
         have worked together on many committees—foreign affairs, public works and public accounts—and we have travelled together on delegations. Neither of us will forget the night we spent in Budapest solving the problems of the world, fortified by a couple of bottles of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Beam" rel="nofollow">
          Jim Beam
         </a>
         . We were staying in the guesthouse supplied by the government. We found out later that it had been the security headquarters of the former communist government and the listening devices were probably still in the walls. Good luck, Alan, for the future. I have really enjoyed your company on many occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Best wishes to Senator Judith Troeth and Senator Russell Trood, whom I worked with particularly closely on committees. I think it is a shame, Russell, that you are leaving so soon. You have a great contribution to make, particularly in your area of foreign affairs. Hopefully, you will get back here. Best wishes to Senator Nick Minchin, whom I did not have a lot to do with on committees because he was always on the front bench and then was Leader of the Government and then in opposition, but I did enjoy some time with him on a visit to Taiwan. And best wishes to Senator Julian

         I was fortunate to grow up in a family where my mother and father believed in three things: faith, family and the Labor Party. There were many tough times, as in all working-class families of that day, but they never lost sight of those beliefs. My parents were here the day that I was sworn in and the day that I made my first speech. They were both life members of the Labor Party. They have since passed away, but I know that I would never have got here if not for their inspiration and their support. To my brothers, Paul, Jim and Danny, and my sister, Clare, who is here tonight, and their families I say thank you all for your support and encouragement and also for all of you joining the branch!

         In 1971 I met Jan Fowler, her parents, Ron and Shirley, and their family. At the time I was in the process of trying to wrest control of the

         Association from the Left. Jan's father, Ron, worked with my father at the Kurnell oil refinery. He and Shirley, and Jan, were active in the local ALP. Ron telephoned me one afternoon. He thought I might need a few extra votes, and he said that his daughter would be coming along to the meeting that night. That, as they say in the classics, was the start of a beautiful friendship. I should say that we got the numbers as well, as Steve Hutchins will recall! Shirley, my mother-in-law, is here tonight. Sadly, Ron has passed away. I thank you, Shirley, for your many years of support and for all those regular political discussions, as I will call them, that we conducted in the true Irish tradition.

         Jan and I have been married for over 35 years. Jan has been my greatest supporter throughout my career both in the union and in the parliament. Many of you know Jan. What you may not know is that Jan gave up the opportunity on at least two occasions to have a career in the New South Wales and the federal parliament. She did that to support me and to look after the family while I was constantly travelling. Jan would have been an excellent MP. Her warmth, her personality and her ability to relate to people far outshines mine. She now serves our community as a councillor in the Sutherland Shire and has achieved the highest vote in each election that she has contested. Thanks, darling, for your love and your unyielding support. Thanks also to my children, Simon, Martin and Jeremy, and Simon's fiancee, Carolyn, who are all with us tonight. They have had to put up with the long absences over many years and the countless branch meetings in our lounge room. They are all members too. We meet at my house, usually with a bottle of red and some cheese on a Sunday afternoon.

            That is a pretty hard act to follow. It is with mixed emotions that I make my valedictory contribution this evening. It has been a tremendous honour and privilege to have served in this place for approaching 15 years now. In my first speech on 8 October 1996 I said:
           </p>
           <p>
            I have found that principles and high ideals are not enough on their own; they need people to express them, to make them live and to make them work.
           </p>
           <p>
            I went on to say:
           </p>
           <p>
            I see it as my task in this place to work for and with the Tasmanian community to repay their faith in me by my commitment to them. In doing that, I intend to be governed by the examples and philosophies that I referred to earlier in this speech, particularly with honour and with special regard for people needing help and compassion and by respecting the beliefs of others.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope that I have lived up to the principles that I espoused in my first contribution to this place. It has certainly been a fabulous experience. I think it was
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
             Paul Keating
            </a>
            who said that a career in parliament was effectively the same as attending university. I have been here long enough to have done a few degrees in a number of different subjects. It is probably well known that one of the subjects I came here with no qualifications in is one that I learnt the most about while here—that is rural and regional affairs and transport.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was early in 1997 that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_MacDonald" rel="nofollow">
             Brian MacDonald
            </a>
            and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lake" rel="nofollow">
             Jack Lake
            </a>
            , from then Senator Bob Collins's office, approached me to take up the cudgel, as it were, as a member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Committee" rel="nofollow">
             Transport Committee
            </a>
            , because Senator Collins was not keen on the travel involved in performing the work on that committee. So I was handed a few pages of a brief and I was asked to attend a hearing. I was subbed into the committee for an aviation safety hearing. When I came out of the hearing, Jack and Brian were waiting for me, to pat me on the back and say, 'We think we have the person who is going to continue in that committee.' I found that I was appointed to a committee which dealt with rural affairs and transport—as I said, not matters on which I had any great knowledge or involvement up until that time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since that time, I think I can say that I have bored many coalition senators and many of my own with estimates contributions that ran for days. I have been involved in committee hearings on diverse subjects including aviation safety—questioning the roles of our regulators, the

            Through committees, I have been involved in biosecurity issues, including issues relating to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
             New Zealand

            apples—and we are still hearing about those—to bees and various production issues and equine influenza, which had such a devastating effect on the Australian horse industry not so long ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            My history saw me involved in the dairy deregulation inquiry that Senator Forshaw just referred to but also in the continuation of inquiries, which have recently been almost concluded, before the Senate Standing Committee on Economics on: the continuing problem of dairy deregulation; on wheat marketing, the performance of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Wheat_Board" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Wheat Board
            </a>
            and related issues; on regional issues, which under the former government we came to know as 'regional rorts', including the inquiries into the various funnellings of funds into coalition electorates by the government for electoral purposes; and something which is still topical, the live export industry, which manifested itself then with cattle and sheep and which now we are seeing in cattle exported to Indonesia.
           </p>
           <p>
            In all of that time we have had the privilege as a committee of travelling throughout Australia, meeting fabulous people involved in critical industries—in regional industries, service industries and transport industries—right around the country. One of the great privileges of being a member of this place and participating in the committee system—in opposition certainly, but also in government—is the opportunity to meet people of integrity and high ideals, people who have strong interests in their community and in their industry and who put a proposition before a Senate committee and seek an outcome that they believe will assist them, their community and their industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            That has been a great privilege and something that I can commend to every senator in this place. I am sure you all already know that. I think it is one of the great benefits that members of this place have. I hope that it continues and I think it should be supported on a bipartisan basis.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have also had the privilege of serving on two select committees in the Senate, including the Senate
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
             Select Committee
            </a>
            on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Trade_Agreement" rel="nofollow">
             Free Trade Agreement
            </a>
            between Australia and the United States of America. Senator Brandis, former Senator
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cook" rel="nofollow">
             Peter Cook
            </a>
            , now deceased, and Senator Conroy also participated on this inquiry. We were privileged to hear some very interesting information on an issue which is critically important to the Australian people. I think some unkind members of the coalition referred the Labor members of the committee to the Privileges Committee about a certain press conference. I think I still have that report. Our side was very certain that a certain coalition member of the committee was backgrounding journalists and probably that provoked us to do something which I think justified reference to the Privileges Committee, but the outcome of the inquiry was probably the just outcome as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other inquiry was into the removal of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSIC" rel="nofollow">
             ATSIC
            </a>
            and the future role for an Indigenous representative body, an inquiry which I participated in as Labor spokesman on Indigenous affairs. That inquiry again allowed me to meet with and speak with some very inspiring
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
             Indigenous Australians
            </a>
            representing their communities in various parts of Australia. What I saw on that inquiry told me that if we could get the government settings right there was a great future for Indigenous Australians, notwithstanding the fact that it would take some time for it all to be put into place. I can honestly say that I came in to this place foreseeing my role as that of a hardworking backbencher, prepared to support my party and the people of my state. When I entered the Senate there was a very strong Senate team in the outgoing Labor government. Many of the remaining senators had the benefit of experience in government, and they were the ones I saw as the benchmark for success as a member of the Senate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I now look back over my career of 14 years and 283 days, as of today, and I can say that I believe I have exceeded my expectations for my role in this place. I was chosen to fill a casual vacancy left by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coates" rel="nofollow">
             John Coates
            </a>
            , whom I replaced on 5 September 1996, not many months after the Labor government had been removed, so I entered this place as a member of the opposition. Just over two years later, on 19 October 1998, Labor caucus chose me to become Labor's Opposition Whip in the Senate. On 22 November 2001, caucus chose me to become part of Labor's shadow ministry, and I remained a member of the shadow ministry until I was excluded from the incoming ministry by the Prime Minister on 3 December 2007. Caucus then chose me as its Government Whip in the Senate, a position I held until 27 September 2010.

            I will always feel honoured that caucus chose me to fill important roles for the Labor Party in the Senate and in the party's leadership positions for what amounts to near enough to 80 per cent of my term in the Senate. It has always been my view that caucus is the supreme body of my party in this parliament and it has always been my view that it is a great honour to be chosen by that body, the elected representatives of my party, to fulfil roles in this place or in the other place. It is an honour and a privilege to have been, for half of that time, a front bench member and serving in important portfolios. It is certainly something I will hold dear for the rest of my days.

            , for their help and advice over the years and for their great leadership of the Labor Party in this place and in the internal forums of the party. I think there would probably be a number of amusing stories I could tell, but will not today, about Senate tactics in opposition and about some of the comments that some individuals made—they would probably blush if I repeated them. Nevertheless, I am not going to do it now. I will hold that up my sleeve just in case.

            No-one in this place succeeds without a substantial contribution from their staff, and I would like to record my thanks to my staff. There have been a number of people over the years and whilst I have not had a huge staff turnover I will not mention them all. I particularly want to thank Sharon Burnie, Lee-Ann Patterson and Bev Catlin, from my Launceston office, whose work over the years has kept the office functioning, even while I spent many days travelling on committee or shadow ministry business in my time in the Senate. I should note that Sharon started with me on 28 April 1997 and deserves particular thanks for putting up with me and doing such a great job over 14 years. I will also thank the former member for Bass and current state member for Bass, Minister Michelle O'Byrne, who worked for me from my commencement in the Senate until her election to the House of Representatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            As Opposition Whip and Government Whip I have had a number of members of staff whose roles have been invaluable. I particularly want to thank

             Llewellyn Rees
            </a>
            for helping me as Opposition Whip, and Kay O'Leary and Maria Neill, who were two of my valued staff members in my role as Government Whip in the Senate. I am certain that they are performing a similar valuable function for Senator Anne McEwen. I want to thank them again, now, for the work they did that allowed me to do the job that I did in that role.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the variety of shadow portfolios that I had, I had a number of advisers. All shadow ministers depend on hard-working dedicated staff; often the degree of their success is proportionate to the capacity of their staff. I began my role as a shadow minister with Jack Lake as my key staff member. Later, Matthew Jose joined my staff. Both went on to work for prime ministers. On the way they were invaluable members of my staff and I want to thank them again for all their hard work and their dedication to the cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also want to make special mention of Martin Breen, who worked so hard with me to help pull together Labor's agriculture policy for the 2007 election. It was gratifying to see that much of the policy that we initiated was subsequently implemented, particularly the reform of export wheat marketing.

I know that Senator Heffernan agrees with me in that regard because he has given her flowers a couple of times, I think.

            I also want to make special mention of

             Anne Lynch
            </a>
            , who, as Mike Forshaw said, is no longer with us. Anne was here when I arrived in the Senate and gave me some very good advice. She said, 'When you start to feel comfortable in this place is when you will start to make mistakes.' It is always wise to bear that in mind, because people sometimes do get a bit relaxed and say or do things that they regret. It is also wise to bear in mind that, when you first come to this place and are scared to put a foot out of place, that is probably when you make the fewest mistakes. If you remember that, you will probably minimise the problems that you will be reflecting on when you come to make your final contribution. I do leave this place, as I say, with mixed feelings, and I have touched upon some of the reasons for those mixed feelings. I have had some tremendous friendships. I remember travell­ing to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" rel="nofollow">
             South America
            </a>
            with the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on a self-funded trip.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Ferguson" rel="nofollow">
             Alan Ferguson
            </a>
            and I formed part of that delegation and it split in two and we were on our own, effectively, going through to Peru and Chile before going back to Uruguay. Alan is great company on a trip, and I am sure many people know that. He is also a great traveller. I can recall sitting next to him on an aircraft leaving
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires" rel="nofollow">
             Buenos Aires
            </a>
            . We were taxiing to the takeoff point and I looked around and he was asleep. That was his greatest strength: he could sleep anywhere on an aircraft at any time and then when he got off he was really raring to go, whereas I was a terrible traveller and was always sleep deprived in that circumstance. Alan Ferguson, you taught me what I should have been able to do in travelling but I never could. You were great company. Although we disagreed on many things, we agreed that we could be good company, have a drink together and keep the confidence of travel in those circumstances.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have also had good relationships with former and current whips.

             Stephen Parry

             Judith Adams

            , of course, has been assisting him. I have had a great relationship with both of those senators in that role and have a great deal of respect for them in the way they manage the honourable business of whip. Someone once said that there are a lot of dark arts to it, but most of it in my view is assisted by the fact that you give your word, you keep your word and there is a balance between being able to give leave to people when they need it and not giving leave when people are trying it on. I think as long as both whips know that this place will work well.

I have to concede that my family have probably made more sacrifices than I have since I came to this place.

            . Louise, to whom I have been married for 32 years now—and I can even remember my anniversary—has been a wonderful friend, confidant and partner who has put up with extended absences, because when you are put on a committee like rural and regional affairs you travel a lot; when you become a shadow minister, you travel more. I have been doing that for most of the 14 years, nearly 15 years, that I have been in this place. Probably the greatest recognition of the load ought to go to my wife Louise. Thank you, darling, for your support over the years.

            My two beautiful daughters Dale and Erin are also in the gallery today. Dale has had me as an absent father for nearly half a life and Erin for 60 per cent of hers. They have both grown up to be wonderful young women. My trip to South America must have been a bit of an omen because Erin ended up going there, learning the language and studying there as well. Maybe that was a good influence. Dale has been a rock for our family, lives in Launceston and works in the nursing profession. She is a very loving and caring person who works in her profession, doing the things that she has been trained for and I think has done herself proud and is respected well by her employer.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are the people who have been my background. My parents died before I came here. In my first speech I set out the influence that they had on me and I hope that that influence and the support of my family have made me a person who has the respect of his colleagues. I will leave this place hoping fervently that that respect remains in the future. I thank you.

             . I stand here tonight on this side of the chamber and, I must say, it is a far better place to be than on the benches opposite, from where I gave my first speech in this place, almost six years ago. To hold government is what we all aspire to and work towards in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Labor Party
             </a>
             —to deliver on our policies, to make the best country in the world to live even fairer and more equitable and to be able to facilitate that fairness and equity for all in our community.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tonight I reflect on the past six years. I am particularly proud to be a member of the Labor government that finally delivered the long overdue apology to the stolen generations of the Aboriginal people. Tonight I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land on which we stand, the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples, and I pay my respects to their elders past and present. In fact, I pay tribute to all Indigenous peoples of Australia, as together we walk along the path of reconciliation. I do so because I firmly believe it is the right thing to do, as it is right to give recognition of our Indigenous people each sitting day in this chamber and to make the welcome to country that now forms part of each new parliament.
            </p>
            <p>
             I stand here proud also to be part of a government that was able to legislate to overturn
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
              Work Choices
             </a>
             , which took away from the Australian workforce and stripped pay, conditions and dignity from hundreds of thousands of employees, including the most vulnerable and marginalised workers. The Labor government worked to bury laws that hurt workers and their families by attacking their rights, holiday pay, public holidays, redundancy provisions, meal breaks and rights of association at work. These laws attacked the Australian belief in a fair day's pay for a fair days work, undid a century of progress in industrial relations in this country and made the words 'fairness' and 'balance' obsolete in a workplace relations context. These laws slashed unfair dismissal rights, fostered agreements that decimated the safety net and rendered the independent umpire impotent. These laws left workers without an effective right to bargain collectively and marginalised unions. They were unfair, unbalanced and, ultimately, un-Australian.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Labor government legislated for a fair work system, where each day workers can go to work knowing that a fair day's work will deliver a fair day's pay—not only equal pay for equal work but equal pay for work of equal value. This legislation restored to seven million workers the right to protection from unfair dismissal and guaranteed minimum standards, clearly outlined minimum wages, a return to freedom of association in the workplace and the right to representation in the workplace. These laws are underpinned by a strong, durable safety net of basic worker conditions and entitlements. They delivered on a promise to the Australian people of a system of fair work through the establishment of Fair Work Australia, the independent umpire with key functions including minimum wage setting, ensuring good-faith bargaining, award variation, approval of agreements, dealing with industrial action, resolution of disputes and unfair dismissal matters. They finally closed the doors on some of the darkest days for workers in this country. These days are gone, but they are not forgotten.

             I am proud, too, to be part of a govern­ment that has driven an ambitious and unprecedented national reform agenda for education. This government has introduced the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history, involving 24,000 projects in 9½ thousand schools, with new class­rooms, libraries, multipurpose halls and trades training centres—infrastructure that will benefit hundreds of thousands of young people in this and future generations. We all know that education does not end when you turn 18 or complete year 12. To deliver the best education at all levels—at preschool, primary and secondary levels and at training and university levels—and to make it affordable and accessible to all people are Labor values and goals that, as a government, we have been working hard to achieve. With education comes opportunity; education really is a window to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am also pleased to be part of a govern­ment that is passionate about our environ­ment. Early in my term here, I discussed the Climate Change Action Bill 2006 and recalled a time when there were distinct seasons in Australia—when footy was played in the rain and mud and when children could play under the sprinkler on a hot afternoon. Now, more frequently we have extraordinary weather events such as floods and bushfires, droughts and cyclones. The protection of the environment has been an enduring passion of mine and it has informed many more years of activism than the six years I have spent in this place speaking often about the climate challenge that confronts us all. We have the opportunity to do so much more. My own state,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              South Australia
             </a>
             , leads the country in terms of hot-rock geothermal energy and other renewable energy sources. This research and development is vital to our future. It is our responsibility to ensure the protection of our environment for this and future generations. I trust that the right decisions will be made in this place in the near future. I am also proud to be a member of a government that recognises the signi­ficance of one of Australia's most important and trusted institutions, our national broadcaster—a government that acknow­ledged the opportunities to be had by increasing funding to the ABC, delivering to it the largest funding increase since it was incorporated in 1983, funding that enabled the ABC to produce up to 90 hours of original Australian drama content per year, in contrast to that under the previous government, which resulted in the level of Australian drama on the ABC falling to less than 20 hours per year. This funding was also used to establish
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC3" rel="nofollow">
              ABC3
             </a>
             , which broadcasts child-appropriate contents for 15 hours per day and is complemented by interactive elements and online content.
            </p>
            <p>
             The National Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill that passed the House of Representatives in November last year will soon be considered by the Senate. The government remains committed to the legislation, and I look forward to the passage of the bill which will see the reinstatement of the position of the staff-elected director on the board—an important enhancement to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
              ABC's
             </a>
             independence, providing the board with a director who has a unique insight into ABC operations. It is for this reason that it is a position that should never have been abolished.

             and a member of the federal executive, and having sat on the University of South Australia's journalism advisory panel, I am familiar with the demands put on journalists. I listened for 10 years to journalists' concerns as the world which they knew changed significantly, seeing the impact it had on jobs as they moved from bi-media to tri-media newsrooms, and then to online journalism and single camera crews.

             Australia currently ranks 18th on the World Press Freedom Index and is one of only 70 nations deemed to have a free press; a further 70 have a partly-free press, and more than 50 are listed as not free. We need to guard and protect the freedom of our media in this country. That is why last year I spoke in support of the Evidence Amendments (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2010, which introduced protections known as shield laws. They foster freedom of the press and ensure better access to information for the Australian public. It is vital that journalists can obtain information so that they can accurately inform the Australia public about matters of interest. As

             once stated, a 'critical, independent, investigative press is the lifeblood of any democracy'. Nelson Mandela also said that the press must enjoy legal protection so that it can protect the rights of citizens, and 'it must be bold and inquiring, without fear or favour'.

             It is imperative that the Australian media behaves honourably and responsibly in its pursuit of truth and its dedication to informing the public. Those who abide by journalists' ethics are doing their profession and our democracy a great service. I encourage the more experienced journalists to mentor the younger and inexperienced journalists working among you in the significance of their role. I urge you to take the time to do this, because your knowledge and understanding will be of benefit to all. Journalists in this country should never lose sight of their role nor let their standards drop. And journalists should proceed with great caution when they find themselves creating the news rather than reporting it; the lines between commentary, opinion and news reporting should not blur.
            </p>
            <p>
             Without doubt, the 24/7 news cycle brought about by new technology is a huge challenge for journalists in their day-to-day working lives, and it is a big challenge for many of us here, too. We are dealing with a minute-by-minute news cycle now, and it does put on enormous pressure. It is an important part of democracy to keep the public well informed but, despite the incredible time pressures facing the media, these demands should always be met with the highest upholding of the Australian journalists' code of ethics and its overriding principle, the public's right to know the facts and the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             With increasing pressure to produce an endless supply of stories, there are some aspects of journalism which must never be compromised. These include ensuring that the best journalistic practices prevail, and that journalists keep sight of the ethical goalposts in their day-to-day operations, however speedily their work must be delivered. I acknowledge that it is a big ask, and at a time of enormous change in the profession, but quality journalism must prevail. We must look after the institution—the fourth estate.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is always disappointing to witness situations where members of the media create stories, or focus on irrelevant information on which to base a story they are creating, when they are out there missing the real news story of the day. It is not many journalists, because most are both ethical and diligent, but it is enough to make an impact, and I urge journalists never to take for granted the huge responsibility which has been bestowed upon them. I have defended the role of journalists for over a decade, and will continue to be an avid supporter of excellence in journalism.

             In this place, much of our time, in sitting and in-between weeks, is spent on committee work, and I have had the good fortune, unlike some others who have already spoken here today, to be appointed to the committees which hold particular interest for me: the Environment, Communications,

It is important that we listen to our young people, who are in many ways the consummate experts when it comes to technology.

             In addition to committee work, as elected representatives we involve ourselves with many groups and organisations from the community. I am co-chair of Vision 2020 Australia, and since its inception this organisation has united the eye health and vision care sector and, in partnership with government, has made great progress towards the elimination of avoidable blindness by 2020. With less than a decade remaining, it is vital that the successful work of Vision 2020 and its members and supporters continues. I have also been involved with the

Other roles I have filled in the past six years include Chair of the Australia-Vietnam Parliamentary Friendship Group; for a while, Deputy Government Whip in the Senate; and Chair of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. On a lighter note, I was a member of the first parliamentary netball team. We had a lot of fun playing against the

             and the Indian Nationals. I would have to say that the sweetest victory of them all—in fact, the only victory—was against the Canberra press gallery. It really was worth the five-degree, 7:30 am on Tuesday morning training sessions.

             Australia is a great country to live in and raise future generations. We should welcome those from other countries who want to make it their home, including those fleeing from persecution. It is my view that we must encourage all generations to come with us on the journey to a fairer, more equitable society. Whenever I stand to sing our national anthem and get to the words 'We've boundless plains to share', it really does make me stop and think.

             We all know that we do not arrive at this place on the hill without the support of many. Tonight I offer my thanks to the Australian Labor Party and the voters of South Australia. I thank all family and friends for the support Russell, Che and I have received over the past six years, particularly Che's nanna, Pamela, and Russell's late father, Kevin, my mother, Janice, who sadly passed away during the election campaign, my sister, Angelique, Dad and Ingrid, and friends, Carene, Paul, Lucy, Hannah, Debra, Paul, Wendy, Grant and Kyle. What can I say about my staff? I thank you for your commitment and I wish each of you successful and fulfilling futures. I thank Kyle, Lesley, Joan, Sharon, Grant, Carol and Shane. I intended having more of my staff here today, however there was volcanic ash and they are back in Adelaide.

             parliament. Crosschecking parliamentary sitting days—when I would be here in Canberra and you would be sitting late in Adelaide—became part of our lives. What a juggle of the daily diary it was. I thank you, and I thank you for the care that you gave to Che.
            </p>
            <p>
             Che, each night I was in Canberra I looked forward to our night-time reading over the phone, when you would lie in bed and I would read your chosen stories, which over the years became chosen novels. I also remember my first year here when an additional sitting day was added before the Christmas break. You were eight years old and were singing in the choir at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peter's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
              St Peter's Cathedral
             </a>
             . On arrival, I ran up the steps, dragging my suitcase with me and leaving it at the door of the cathedral, and slipped in quickly but quietly up the side aisle. I knelt down, our eyes met and you gave me the best smile. I had made it for the last three carols. I was so thankful, but I learnt that day that our lives had changed and I would never make a promise to you that I may not be able to keep. So tonight, Che, I make you this promise: whatever I do in the future, my base will be in Adelaide and I will be there most nights for the next five years to oversee your home work.
            </p>

To my colleagues Senators Hurley, Hutchins, Forshaw and O'Brien, who are also coming to the end of their term, I wish you all the best in your post-Senate lives. I also wish all the best to those opposite: Senators Minchin, Trood, Barnett, Troeth, Ferguson,

              On behalf of the government I would like to make a few remarks about each of the three senators who have spoken tonight. I know my colleagues share with me a sense of loss—that we lose so much experience and talent from the government Senate team. There is particularly the loss of two of our most experienced and reliable senators, Senators Forshaw and O'Brien, who I have shared the journey with. They both referred to some fairly tough years in opposition. They were great companions and great contributors during that time. We got to see
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Wortley" rel="nofollow">
               Dana Wortley
              </a>
              serve only one term, ending up in the death seat—winning one and losing one—but I know she has more to contribute. Senator Wortley, it is really good that we farewell you from the government benches. It is a small consolation but an important one, particularly for those like
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_O'Brien" rel="nofollow">
               Kerry O'Brien
              </a>
              and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Forshaw" rel="nofollow">
               Mike Forshaw
              </a>
              , who spent such long and hard years in opposition. I wish the opposition many long and hard years in opposition. I think they have already learnt how hard they are, but they need more time to really appreciate it. We look forward to them getting the full experience. In the short time available to me, I do not intend to try and canvass the careers of each government senator leaving and I certainly do not want to turn the speech into an obituary. All three have more to contribute to society and the Labor movement, and I am sure that they will all take up further challenges. Senator Mike Forshaw had the unenviable task of replacing Richo, which were big shoes to fill, but he has done it admirably. He came from a long background in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
               AWU
              </a>
              but brought a different sort of experience: not only his law degree but his degree in literature. It was great to hear him quote
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huck_Finn" rel="nofollow">
               Huck Finn
              </a>
              tonight, because he has often had a passage to recount to sum up a situation. Mike has made a tremendous contribution in the committees of the Senate and on the front bench in opposition. I think he downplayed the role that he played in taking on a heavy load representing opposi­tion spokespeople in the Senate as opposition parliamentary secretary. I always thought he was unlucky not to get more of a chance on the front bench, but I see now that he concedes it was self-inflicted, so I feel less sorry for him on that basis! Never give a sucker an even break, mate—and he clearly made a mistake there!
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator Forshaw has made a huge contribution to the Labor cause, both on the front bench and in committee work, and I think that has been recognised in recent years when he has been elected by the caucus as chair of the powerful Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee of the parliament. It is seen as probably the most important chair's role in the parliament, and Mike has done it with tremendous aplomb and has developed enormous expertise and contacts in Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I know he is highly regarded by the diplomatic corps in Canberra and has a huge level of expertise and experience that I am sure he will put to good use. He also, for his sins, was made international secretary of the Labor Party, which I think was a poorly remunerated but highly responsible role, and I know he will continue his interest in those matters.
             </p>
             <p>
              I say to Mike that I have enjoyed his company and his fellowship, and I acknowledge very much the contribution he has made. He has always been a constructive force in the Senate and in the Labor team. I know
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Faulkner" rel="nofollow">
               John Faulkner
              </a>
              and I both, in our times as leaders, have found him to be one of those people who has been a team player and has been prepared to share the load and to do things for the broader common good. He did have a terrible habit, though, whenever I made interjection in the Senate, of claiming credit for it and getting it recorded in the Senate
              <i>
               Hansard
              </i>
              as him being the author, which I am still to this day peeved about! I assume he used to go up to the Hansard reporters afterwards and claim credit!
             </p>
             <p>
              Mike, best of luck in your future. We really appreciate your contribution. You have had a very strong career in this place and have made a huge contribution. I know your Labor colleagues will miss you.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator Kerry O'Brien, like me, came out of the LHMWU. He went down to Tasmania to be their state official and became a true Tasmanian. He is now as parochial as the rest of you, Senator Abetz, and has developed a real love for and appreciation of Tasmania. Kerry came into the Senate into 1996 and has done the hard yards in a long period of opposition. He played a huge role as opposition whip and on the opposition front bench. Kerry succeeded me as opposition whip and did a fantastic job. He referred earlier to his time in Senate tactics committees, and there were some interesting and memorable times as we sought to make the attack fresh, even though we had had many goes at it. Kerry also talked about his contribution in terms of regional affairs, primary industry and local government and transport. He made himself a real expert in those areas and a go-to man for the Labor Party. He developed the interest there to great effect in terms of the Labor Party.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do not think it is widely known, but in my view Kerry was one of the best in opposition at using the estimates and questions on notice to great effect. Some others were probably better media performers in that regard, but Kerry always got good value out of his role in estimates, committees and questions on notice and he used those tools of the parliament to great effect on behalf of the Labor Party in opposition. As he mentioned, though, he always made the best decision you can make in politics, and that is to employ good staff. He mentioned a few of them, and they do make or break you in this game. Kerry and others, I know, have paid tribute to their staff.
             </p>
             <p>
              Kerry, I know you are very highly regarded in the sectors in which you worked. Some people who are perhaps not friends of the Labor Party always sang your praises in terms of the work you did in the portfolios of rural and regional affairs and transport et cetera, and I know they would have been disappointed to lose you if you moved on from that particular portfolio. You are known as someone of strong values and substance and, as I said, you were well respected by the all of the groups that you dealt with.
             </p>
             <p>
              Kerry, you referred to the fact that you did not make the ministry after the election. In my view, that was a great injustice and should not have occurred. You should have been a minister. You deserved to be one, and you would have been a good minister. I think that was an error. But your mettle was shown when you took on the job of whip and continued to contribute to the government. I think that is a great mark of your personal attributes, and the fact that you continued to serve the government and be a constructive member of the government is a great mark of your commitment to the Labor cause.
             </p>
             <p>
              On a personal level, I have enjoyed your friendship. They say in parliament, 'If you want a friend, get a dog,' but I regard you, Kerry, as a friend, and I have appreciated your support and friendship over the years. I was a bit surprised when I was having a conversation with somebody once and they said, 'Yes, that Kerry O'Brien; he is the thinking woman's sex symbol.' Then I realised it was the other Kerry O'Brien, but it was good while it lasted, Kerry! I also advise colleagues that he has terrible choice in football sides, and a tip from those who have had experience: never back one of Kerry's horses in a race. They are always beautifully named, with great Labor names, but they are very slow, generally. I have given up backing his horses in races! But, Kerry, I hope you enjoy those pursuits now that you might have a little bit more time.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know Louise has played a tremendous role in supporting you, and it is great to see Dale and Erin here, even if it might be because of the plane issues. But, as I said, I know you have more to contribute, and we look forward to you continuing to contribute to the Labor cause and appreciate very much your service. The government is very grateful for the contribution you have made in this place.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would like to acknowledge Dana's contribution over the last six years. She has been a bit unlucky to only get the one term. That is the danger of running the number three, as Mike Forshaw pointed out earlier. It is a bit like being a marginal seat member and, unfortunately, she was not re-elected at the last election. But I think Dana in her speech exemplified the contribution she had made through the passion she brings to issues and the passion she brings to her commitment to the Labor Party, be it in com­munications, education or the environment. I know she has taken the opportunity of being in the parliament to really pursue her interests in those areas and to argue passionately for what she sees as creating more opportunity for people who perhaps do not get the opportunities they should. She has been a very strong advocate for social justice and opportunity in this parliament and has really seized the opportunity that the parliament provides. I think of her as always highly passionate about her causes, and that is a great thing for us and for the parliament.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, Dana, we will certainly miss your contribution. I think you, too, will have more to offer in coming years, although I note that it will be
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               South Australia
              </a>
              n based. I know you have had to deal with the pressures we all have with being partner and parent and being away for long periods of time. I know you were very conscious to keep in contact with Russell and Che during his development years. I am not sure he will be so keen on you supervising his homework, but no doubt he will like having you home more.
             </p>
             <p>
              I note, though, that I have constantly worried about Dana's health while she has been here, because apart from the time when she is actually in the chamber she has a mobile phone stuck to her ear. I do not know if I have ever seen her outside the chamber when she has not been on the mobile phone. If there are any health issues associated with mobile phone usage, Dana will be the first to display that! So, Dana, I hope for your sake that they are as safe as claimed.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have enjoyed your contribution and your comradeship. I have very much appreciated the contribution you have made and the personality that you have brought to everything you have done.
             </p>
             <p>
              On behalf of the government, I want to acknowledge and thank Senators O'Brien, Forshaw and Wortley for their contribution. In a sense, doing a job lot is not the best way to deal with these things, but I think each of their careers stands on its own merits and the contributions they have made. I think all three gave really interesting contributions tonight that highlighted their personal strengths and contributions. It was inter­esting to see the way the speeches reinforced what I had been thinking about their contributions and interests and also brought out their own personalities—with Mike particularly keen to display his ongoing humour, which has been one of his great strengths. It is not only the capacity for humour; the capacity to laugh at yourself is very important in this job.
             </p>
             <p>
              So I thank all three of you very much for your contribution. I pass on the personal best wishes of the Prime Minister, who will come across to our function next week and put her own thanks on the record. We wish you all the best. I am conscious that all three of you have more to contribute. These are not obituaries but farewells, and we look forward to the contribution you continue to make to the community and to the Labor cause. All the best.

               Today we have heard from the first batch, if I can call them that, of departing Senators—12 of them: six coalition, five Labor and one
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_First" rel="nofollow">
                Family First
               </a>
               —whose terms expire on 30 June. If the elections were held today I would suspect a few different results, but that is not to be.
              </p>
              <p>
               All senators, irrespective of party, make huge sacrifices, as do their families, as they seek to serve our nation. Today we say farewell to three Labor senators. I confess to some mixed emotion as well. But this is a day for Labor to celebrate its people, who have served their cause in the advancement of our nation. I suspect that the bound copies of the
               <i>
                Hansard
               </i>
               that will be produced for these valedictories will be such that Labor senators would not want a necessarily long contribution from coalition senators; but, nevertheless, I do believe it is important for Australians to know the respect that we do have for those who sit opposite us, which is not necessarily accurately portrayed by the 30-second clip from Senate estimates or question time, when we sometimes let down ourselves and the people whom we seek to serve.
              </p>
              <p>
               Allow me to turn to the three senators who are leaving. I confess to being the one who commented on Senator Forshaw's follicle fastidiousness today. I suspect it was out of an excess of jealousy on my part! I did privately ponder whether he had in fact used a wide comb to get the effect—which is a good segue into his distinguished union career, which he wore with pride in this chamber, always referring to it and never letting go of his commitment to those that he had previously served in the trade union movement. I dare say many Australians will recall Senator Forshaw as being the person who fronted the cameras as the returning officer to announce Ms Gillard's election as Prime Minister, which must be one year this week or thereabouts. It must be getting exceptionally close. More importantly it would be fair to say that Senator Forshaw and I did share certain values which I must say were dear to my heart. It does surprise one from time to time that people with different backgrounds and different views nevertheless have something in common—of course, I refer to some of the social issues on which conscience votes were held in this place where Senator Forshaw and I were able to sit on the same side of the House. I also commend Senator Forshaw for his dissenting report on the territories bill which, if I might say, was both principled and gutsy. When we disagreed with his views, Senator Forshaw still had that same principled and gutsy approach.
              </p>
              <p>
               His constituent work was also legendary: something that senators can, if they want to, get away without doing and ignoring by virtue of being senators. But I think that those who do try to ignore it miss out on one of the most rewarding aspects of being a senator. From all reports, Senator Forshaw did that exceptionally well. Whilst people said that Senator Forshaw had big shoes to fill in taking over from Senator
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Richardson" rel="nofollow">
                Graham Richardson
               </a>
               , I think that senator-elect Thistlewaite will have huge shoes to fill in seeking to replace Senator Forshaw. On behalf of the coalition, I wish Senator Forshaw all the best in life after politics.
              </p>
              <p>
               I turn to my fellow Tasmanian, Senator O'Brien. It would be fair to say that I have seen more of him around the state of Tasmania by virtue of our being senators for that great state. As a result, I have had more interaction with him than with the other two senators that we farewell tonight. One of the jobs that you have to do in trying to determine what to say on occasions like this is to read the first speech. Tonight I can offer an apology to Senator O'Brien. You will recall that there was a motion for a Senate inquiry into
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
                AFL
               </a>
               to be played in Tasmania. I confess I thought that Senator O'Brien was simply doing this as a political stunt et cetera, and I made comments to that effect. Much to my horror, when I reach his first speech, he in fact mentioned that as an issue that he was concerned about. He commented on all the great Australian rules footballers that Tasmania produces. On that basis, please accept my apology. It is nice to know that you have the passion for Tasmania to have a football team.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other interesting thing I picked up in Senator O'Brien's first speech was his commentary on the 1989 state election:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               … Labor, in accord with the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                Tasmanian Greens
               </a>
               , replaced Gray's Liberal government, but Labor found itself with an impossible task. Minority government and big public debt …
              </p>
              <p>
               I will not say anything other than how history repeats itself. In relation to Senator O'Brien, I finish by saying that the task he set himself in concluding his first speech, which was to work for and with the Tasmanian community to repay their faith in him by his commitment to them, he has achieved exceptionally well. You leave this place being able to be well satisfied that you have truly served the people of Tasmania. I wish you and your family all the best and trust that you will enjoy the vineyard in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_Valley" rel="nofollow">
                Tamar Valley
               </a>
               and things Tasmanian.
              </p>
              <p>
               I can assure you that the coalition, whilst we did not necessarily like one aspect of your work—that was, as federal opposition spokesman on primary industry matters—we respected it, and you did keep the government to account on a continuous basis. That will be a great credit to you. On a friendlier basis, we appreciated your role as whip. From the coalition's point of view, common sense and camaraderie always prevailed in relation to the decisions and in relation to pairs. That is vitally important for the effective working of this place. You did it exceptionally well, so from the coalition's point of view, a big thank you to Senator O'Brien for making things work as well as they did.
              </p>
              <p>
               I turn to Senator Wortley. Unfortunately, I have known her for the shortest time. When I talked about having some mixed emotions, my mixed emotion is that we have lost a Labor senator for a Greens senator. I can say that without any Greens in the chamber and undoubtedly get unanimous support for my comment. Chances are, out of the three, Senator Wortley and I share the least in common. She has been described as being Left, and indeed hard Left from the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Duncan" rel="nofollow">
                Peter Duncan
               </a>
               faction. That is all beyond me, struggling as I do within the Liberal Party and Tasmania, let alone in offshore places such as
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                South Australia
               </a>
               . But I do note her first speech covered all the same topics that she covered this evening.
              </p>
              <p>
               You remained true and committed to those views and those principles. Those differ­ences do not stop us in the coalition recognising you as a very pleasant and principled individual who helped to make this place work. I wish you well. As you described it in your first speech, it was an honour to be elected as a senator and you said that you would treat that honour with respect. You have done that by the bucket load. We wish you well for the future.

                It is indeed a pleasure tonight to be able to say some words about my departing colleagues. I probably should get in quickly, because I know they will have a chance next week to square up. Of the three, clearly I have known
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Forshaw" rel="nofollow">
                 Michael Forshaw
                </a>
                the longest, and I want to leave Michael to the end of my comments.
               </p>
               <p>
                Senator Wortley is someone I first met when she came to Canberra. As Senator Forshaw mentioned, in the right-wing Labor Senate caucus we used to dine each Tuesday night at a place called the Hoggerama, and that is how we got to meet and get to know Senator Wortley. Senator Wortley was christened 'Dixie' by a number of colleagues. One of the great attributes of Dixie is that she is still as passionate as she was when she made her first speech—as Senator Abetz mentioned—about public broadcasting and journalism. She was still that passionate today when she made her valedictory. It has been great to watch her and to listen to and learn from her in that area.
               </p>
               <p>
                My colleague Senator O'Brien and I were in
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Labor" rel="nofollow">
                 Young Labor
                </a>
                together in
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                 New South Wales
                </a>
                , along with Senator Faulkner and a few other people that are still around. In those days in Young Labor their group used to win in the Statewide; Michael's and my group have run it, I think, for the last 15 years or something like that. It was a good training ground, and Kerry was his usual dogged self even back in those days; Kerry would never let a bone go even when he was about 18 or 19, and he still does not now at his ripe old age. As he said, we have coloured our hair together. I got to know Kerry again when I came to Canberra. In that period, I knew him as a whip, a shadow minister and an ordinary colleague in the Senate. He has been of great assistance to me. He has a lot of common sense. In our last estimates hearings, a number of department heads and people from the public sector and private industry privately and publicly bent over themselves to make a compliment to Kerry about his contribution to public policy in those areas that he has acquired a passion for. We will miss him here in the Senate.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will talk about my old mate Michael Forshaw. When we were talking about our departing speech, as I recall, Michael—as he said, we went to school together, but he was a few forms ahead of me—said we should give it in Latin, which we all had to learn. It was a relief to me tonight, when Michael got up and spoke English, that I would not have to go through and translate my contribution next week.
               </p>
               <p>
                Michael rightly said that, when we were first active in the late sixties and early seventies, our area of Sydney was heavily controlled by the Left. In fact, the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire" rel="nofollow">
                 Sutherland Shire
                </a>
                was then called the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Belt" rel="nofollow">
                 Red Belt
                </a>
                . The leading acolyte for the Left in that area was one
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Gietzelt" rel="nofollow">
                 Arthur Gietzelt
                </a>
                , who became a senator here and also a minister in the Hawke government. Arthur still lives in the Sutherland Shire, and I may make a contribution about Arthur next week, which might be interesting. As Michael said, Michael led the charge to take Young Labor over from the Left. I and my friends
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Della_Bosca" rel="nofollow">
                 John Della Bosca

                and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lee" rel="nofollow">
                 Michael Lee
                </a>
                took it over from Michael and Jan, his wife, and it was taken over from us by a fellow called Tony Iffland, who is up in the gallery this evening.
               </p>
               <p>
                One thing Michael did not mention was his contribution to the election of Labor in 1972 and to us holding the seat in 1974. I was talking to my old mate Michael Lee this evening, and he reminded me of a story
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Egan" rel="nofollow">
                 Michael Egan
                </a>
                told about Michael Forshaw running around very actively in those 1972 and 1974 elections. We won the seat of Cook in 1972 and we held it in 1974, when
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
                 Gough Whitlam
                </a>
                held power by only five seats—and we will not talk about 1975. We have not held the seat of Cook since 1975, and it is a tribute to the influence of Michael Forshaw and his family in the area that we were even able to hold the seat for that period. Michael Forshaw and in particular his father were very close to Gough Whitlam. Michael's father passed away last year. Mr Whitlam could not attend the funeral, but he did send his condolences.
               </p>
               <p>
                Michael became the general secretary of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
                 AWU
                </a>
                . We used to deal with each other as senior union officials. When
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Richardson" rel="nofollow">
                 Graham Richardson
                </a>
                decided to retire, Michael was put forward by elements of the group that he and I were associated with. In fact the general secretary at the time, John Della Bosca, wanted Michael to be the successor to Graham Richardson. I was president at the time, and I sat in with John while we talked to the other fellow who wanted the spot,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Easson" rel="nofollow">
                 Michael Easson
                </a>
                . Michael Easson eventually conceded that he was not going to get the Senate spot, left the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
                 NSW
                </a>
                Labor Council and now is a multimillionaire, and Michael Forshaw retires on a parliamentary pension.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again, I talked to Michael Lee this afternoon, and he reminded me that in 1996 he was in a very difficult count to hold onto his seat; it was thought, in fact, that we might lose the seat of Dobell. I was not here then, but I roughly recall that the decision was made to fill the vacancy in the shadow ministry. Michael Lee was re-elected, and as a result of that Michael Forshaw did stand down from the frontbench to make way for Michael Lee. Part of Michael Forshaw's contribution is that he will always do the right thing; sometimes it is with pain. He did outline how difficult it was for him to vote for
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
                 Kevin Rudd
                </a>
                over
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">
                 Kim Beazley
                </a>
                . I know that that was a terrible thing for him to have to do, but he felt he was doing the right thing. I know that he still thinks about the decision he made that day, but I know that he feels he did make the right decision. That is part of his make-up; he will do what he thinks is the right thing, despite the fact that on occasion it is he who will suffer for that decision. It is good to get in first—and I probably should tell some other stories about him but I might have to wait until the adjournment next Thursday if he replies next Wednesday night. But it is good to be here tonight to be able to compliment an old mate, the person I have known the longest in this vicinity, and to be able to say: thank you for everything you have done for the labour movement. There are many people in the workforce and in the community that owe a lot to your silent dedication and your work, which will never be forgotten by any of us. Thanks, Mike.

                 It can be adversarial across the chamber, from one side to the other. However, at times like this that is pushed to one side and there is a common element of respect and also of appreciation and value of service. I will briefly comment on my relationship with the three retiring senators who have given their valedictory addresses tonight.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Forshaw and I worked together on the Public Works Committee some time ago and we were a thorn in the side, with another couple of colleagues, of a lot of government agencies. We believed in what we were doing and the prosecution of our cause was relentless. Senator Forshaw, you and I would often chat during the breaks about where we thought the next line of questioning should go for the benefit of the Commonwealth. I really appreciated those times and travelling with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator O'Brien, you made some generous remarks about our roles as whips. It is an integral part of this parliament and it can only work if there is honesty and cooperation between the two whips. You and I disagreed on a number of issues, but when it came to the important matters of the day, when it came to giving our word to each other, sometimes against the wishes of our own side, we did that; we kept our word, and the parliament functioned far better for that cause. I did appreciate working with you and I did appreciate the way we always had the welfare of our senators probably as the paramount issue and the running of the chamber second, with our political differences coming a close third. We did run the chamber in a manner that I think befits the way the chamber should be run, and I appreciated that opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Wortley, we came in together in 2004. We were elected at the same time and it is disappointing to see that you will not be here to continue in your role. I valued our discussions together. In the early days I think we were 'union reps' together; I will not go any further, but every senator and member post 2004 understands exactly what I am saying. We did prosecute causes together as well, mostly to no avail. However, we are the dominant number now in both chambers, so I think 'watch this space' could be a very important line. Well done on your contribution in that short time. I have appreciated knowing you and also working with you when you were deputy whip. Congratulations on that contribution over that period.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To the three senators: I have appreciated knowing you and I know a lot of our colleagues have enjoyed your company. You have been here for the right reasons—philosophically sometimes not so, but for the right reasons for your constituents—and you have contributed well to this chamber.

                  On an occasion such as this I want to acknowledge the important contributions of the three senators that we honour tonight: Senator Wortley, Senator O'Brien and Senator Forshaw. I want to make some particular remarks about my Tasmanian colleague Senator O'Brien, but I will make some remarks first about Senator Wortley and Senator Forshaw.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Senator Wortley is bright, forthright and always on the mobile phone—I certainly noticed that. I have not known her that well or for that long and I deeply regret the fact that she was not re-elected. She would have continued to make a very passionate, knowledgeable and intelligent contribution. You never forget when you have had a conversation with her. All the very best, Senator. I am sure you have a great deal more to contribute.

                  I have known Kerry since 1983. I thought I knew him longer than anyone in this place, but I was not aware that Kerry knew Steve Hutchins in

                  in New South Wales. Kerry came to Tasmania in 1983 in unusual circumstances. He became secretary of the Miscellaneous Workers Union. I know all of the circumstances; I am not going to count them here, but there were unusual circumstances in Kerry coming to Tasmania for that union.

                  Quite a few things struck me about Kerry, and he has carried those attributes or observations I made of him right through to this day. He is very intelligent, very diligent, knowledgeable and utterly committed to whatever his task at hand, whether it was with the union in that period or, more latterly, during his Senate career. He is incredibly tenacious and a person of great substance. As he mentioned, he came into the Senate as the replacement for

                  shortly after we moved into opposition. It is a bit of a tradition in Tasmania, and quite a lot of us know of this, that you are expected to move to suit the circumstances of a party in Tasmania.

                    I know you know it; you have had to do it twice! For Kerry, it is a hallmark of his dedication and commitment to the Labor Party in Tasmania that he moved from Hobart to Launceston to re-establish himself and re-establish a Labor presence in that part of the state. That has always been of particular importance in Tasmania: whether Liberal or Labor, a number of us have had to put the party's interests ahead of where we have been located. I think one of the most impressive contributions Kerry made was at a time we moved into opposition and I was part of the leadership group. Frankly, we were scratching our heads as to who would deal with issues relating to transport and agriculture. There was no real standout, no obvious candidate, I have to say, in that new Labor opposition. But Kerry applied himself to that particular set of tasks. Although not the shadow minister initially, he decided to develop a knowledge and an expertise in the agriculture, forestry and fishing, primary industries and transport areas. They were not issues of immediate, obvious interest to him, but he dedicated himself to those particular areas—although I do note that, in his first speech, he did comment extensively on transport issues. So Kerry focused on that committee work, and, frankly, I do not know what we would have done without him in those areas in those early days of opposition. It was particularly tough and hard, but he applied himself with great focus, diligence and knowledge. You could always rely on Kerry to be across his brief like, frankly, almost no other shadow minister at that time. He was an acknowledged expert, certainly, in that early period and then when he became a shadow minister.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As Kerry mentioned,
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans" rel="nofollow">
                     Chris Evans
                    </a>
                    as well, when you work so long and hard as a shadow minister, in opposition, and you do not make the ministry in government, it is very, very disappointing. I can understand how Kerry would have felt. And Kerry did work his guts out in all of the areas he had responsibility for, as well as if not better than most other shadow ministers in the period leading up to the election in 2007. I certainly regret, Kerry, that you did not make it to the ministry. That is never easy. Even though Kerry was not on the front bench as a minister, he kept working diligently and he re-assumed the position of whip until just before the last election.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Kerry's other attribute, if it can be called that, is that he has a sporting and racing knowledge that I think is second only to one other senator that I have known in this place,
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ray" rel="nofollow">
                     Robert Ray
                    </a>
                    . It was pretty hard to beat Robert Ray on the sporting side. But Kerry has an amazing knowledge of sporting and racing, and I know he has a keen and passionate interest in equine matters.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Although Kerry is leaving this place, he is not retiring. Kerry, I am sure you will be able to contribute much more actively to your own areas of interest. I wish you all the very, very best. You have made a very significant contribution. I should also mention that Kerry was a leading figure within the Labor Party organisation in Tasmania for many, many years. He was on the state conference, on the state administrative committee—and you can only grimace, being on that body for an extensive period of time!—and also on the national executive of the party. So Kerry has made an outstanding contribution within the state of Tasmania and, obviously, as a Labor senator but also for and on behalf of the Labor Party. He never forgot his working-class, union focus and ethics; he carried that approach right through his Senate and parliamentary career. All the best, Kerry, to you and your family. Thank you.

                     I just want to say a few words, having been mentioned generously by a couple of the retiring senators on the other side. I will start by referring to Senator Wortley, whom I have not known as well as many other

                     n senators, because in this place you tend to get to know the people you work with on committees best of all. Although we see each other on a social basis at times, it is when you actually work with people that you get to know them really well. But, Dana, I have always admired your enthusiasm—like some others, I do not always share all of your views but I do admire the way you put them. I think, even within your own party, you have shown your enthusiasm for the causes that you believe in and brought them to the forefront. And that is why we come to a place like this: to try to make a difference. Although your time here has not been that long, I think you have made a difference. I certainly wish you, Russell and Che well in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It was interesting to hear Senator Sherry talking about Senator O'Brien's knowledge of horseracing. When I first got to know Kerry—after he had been here for a year or two, actually—we did go to
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" rel="nofollow">
                      South America
                     </a>
                     together and, as we travelled around, we had a chance to talk. At the time, I just happened to have a share in a very good horse—well, I thought it was a
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup" rel="nofollow">
                      Melbourne Cup
                     </a>
                     winner—so Kerry used to keep asking me, 'How's the horse going?' With a name like Jeune Amour, it could not help but win! But I knew Kerry was a man who was very keen on horses and, certainly, his own horses that were racing at the time, and so we got to know each other very well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I want to endorse another thing that Senator Sherry said. I rarely feel sorry for anybody on the other side of the chamber, but I did feel sorry for Kerry after the 2007 election when he was, as he put it, excluded from the ministry. At the time, there were a number of so-called high-flyers elected in 2007 who seemed to be able to find their way into jobs without doing any of the hard yards in this place. Kerry had done more hard yards than anybody I know. Throughout that period when he was shadow minister for agriculture, he and
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lake" rel="nofollow">
                      Jack Lake
                     </a>
                     were a very formidable team. They were a very formid­able team, which is probably why Jack finished up in the Prime Minister's office. Well, I think that is where he finished up; I have a sneaking suspicion he was still filtering a bit of information back this way at times!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I think that Kerry would have made a very good agriculture minister. I have said that to all of my colleagues who asked me. As a matter of fact, after today's performance, he would probably be better than the one you have got now. I should not really put that in a valedictory speech—no offence to Senator Ludwig, of course. Kerry, I wish you well. You have made a great contribution.

                     used to tell me how great you were to work with as the Opposition Whip. At times it is not easy. It is not easy to make decisions, as Senator Parry knows and Senator McEwen knows. He always appreciated working with you and I am sure he would want me to pass on his best wishes to you as well.

The longer the night went, the more we had in common. I had no idea why he was in the Labor Party. Had I asked some of my friends in the rural industries, particularly at the time of the wide combs dispute, I probably would have found there were some differences. It was about the second delegation I had ever been on and I think it might have been Michael's first. His wife, Jan, and my wife, Anne, became firm friends. The original delegation was supposed to go to Poland, Hungary and the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic" rel="nofollow">
                      Czech Republic
                     </a>
                     —I think it might have even been Czechoslovakia then, I cannot remember. At the last minute, they pulled the Czech program off, so we only went to Poland and Hungary. I was talking to Michael before we left and said, 'Bugger it, I really wanted to go on this trip because I wanted to go to Prague.' The Czech part of the trip was what attracted me. He said, 'Same here.' So we made an arrangement that when the official delegation finished just the two of us with our wives would have a little 'bilateral' to Czechoslovakia—and we did. We had the most wonderful three days being looked after there by the local Austrade commissioner and his wife. It was the start of a firm friendship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We worked on the Public Works Committee together for a considerable time. I was Senator Forshaw's predecessor as Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for eight years. I still remember after the 2000 election Senator Forshaw coming to me and saying, 'I might want to chew your ear a bit; I think I am going to get your old job.' Michael, for the past three years, has been a wonderful chair of that committee. There is an enormous amount of networking with diplomats. He is able to be diplomatic in his treatment of them and is able to understand them. I found over my eight years in the job I got enormous support from opposition people because it probably is the most bipartisan committee in the whole of the parliament, if the truth be known. In all the time I have been on that committee, which is longer than I care to remember, the only dissenting report that I can remember was written by

                     of the Greens. It was a single dissenting report. The rest of the time we seemed to be able to reach a compromise because, as I have always said in this place, unanimous reports carry far more weight than majority reports and minority reports. Inevitably, when consid­ering legislation, the government puts in a majority report, the opposition puts in a minority report and the government treats it as opposition, whereas if you put in a unanimous report governments have to take some notice. They do not always agree. Michael has shown in his time as chair that he can work with his colleagues to reach consensus. whether those colleagues are on that side of the chamber or on this side of the chamber.

                     Michael, you have had a distinguished career. I have enjoyed your friendship and Jan's. I wish you well in the future. I am sure there are many things you will do in the future that will give you satisfaction. To each of you who have given your contributions tonight, I wish you all the best in the future.

                      I too would like to acknowledge the contributions of all the senators who have spoken tonight. As Government Whip, I would like to say how much I have appreciated the fact that, despite their retiring, all of our government senators have continued to contribute fulsomely to the business of the Senate and the parliament and have been very generous in agreeing to do whatever I have asked them to do in these last few weeks. They have always worked hard and clearly they are going to continue to do so until the last moment.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I will miss their contributions, their willingness to do whatever is required and the good humour with which they adapted to the ever-changing and often mysterious program of the Senate. I also thank all of them for their very thoughtful and polite interactions with the staff in the whip's office over a long period of time.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I also acknowledge the work of the staff of the retiring senators, as I know that a number of the senators' staff will also be leaving this place. I thank them for their contribution to the work of the parliament. You should all be very proud of yourselves for your professionalism and for the dedication that you have shown to your bosses.

                      I would like to say a few words about the senators who have spoken this afternoon. Senator Forshaw: apart from your patience, good humour and fondness for lollies, I particularly acknowledge your assistance in sorting out important issues to do with committee memberships, office-holder positions and other such party matters. Your leadership and the respect that you have from all of your colleagues made it possible for you to be a trusted go-to person to sort out those issues. Those aspects of the manage­ment of our work here in the Senate may not be immediately apparent to everyone, but they are the hidden cogs of this very complex system. Your support has enabled this place to function. Your corporate knowledge on such matters and your valuable history has been greatly appreciated by whips, I know. Senator

                      Senator Dana Wortley and I have spent many hours, many days and, in fact, many years on the Senate environment and communications committee in its various incarnations. When I was chair of that committee Senator Dana Wortley was an absolute stalwart. She was always really well prepared to bail up ministers to make sure they gave the necessary assistance to the committee members. She always showed great interest in any matter the committee inquired into. She also made sure that she used every opportunity that she had to pursue her passions, which include workers' rights, industrial relations, the ABC,

                      Aside from her strictly senatorial duties, Dana Wortley also played a very important role in the life of government senators, organising on many occasions informal get-togethers in her office that involved food, music and other things. She did that especially on late sitting nights. Her contribution to social occasions has been very much appreciated. Of course, her contribution to the parliamentary sports club has been awesome. Thank you for encouraging those of us who are less active to get out and do things. Thank you for your six years in the Senate. I look forward to seeing you advocating on behalf of South Australia in whatever you choose to do next.

                      , for whom I have immense regard. I will miss him very much. He has taught me a lot. When I was first elected to the Senate I was fortunate to become a member of the infamous Rural and Regional Affairs and
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Committee" rel="nofollow">

                      </a>
                      . At that time Kerry was the shadow minister for transport and later he became the shadow minister for primary industries, fisheries and forestry. Kerry O'Brien's pursuit of the then government through the portfolio areas covered by the R

                      committee was a lesson to all of us and certainly a lesson to a brand-new senator. Whether at inquiries or at estimates he was absolutely dogged in his relentless pursuit of witnesses. He has always backed that up with his in-depth knowledge of the broad range of portfolio areas that he covered from primary industries to transport. I remember that airline safety was a passion of his and obviously still is.

                     <p>
                      In 2007, as has been said, Senator Kerry O'Brien was made the Government Whip in the Senate. It is fair to say that his work in that role provided me with a solid understanding of the many-faceted, always interesting and sometimes very frustrating role of Government Whip. Kerry was very supportive of me when I became whip and has continued to be supportive. I would like to thank Senator Kerry O'Brien for leaving me with not only many words of whipping wisdom and a few stray bottles of wine when he left the whip's office but also his truly excellent staff—Kay and Maria, who are indeed the real power behind the whip's throne.

                     <p>
                      I wish Senators Forshaw, O'Brien and Wortley all the very best. I thank them again for their assistance and support.

                       I would like to thank Senator Forshaw for being one of my five favourite people to argue with in this place. I am not sure how I am going to replace you, but I will do my very best. I enjoyed serving on the committee under your chairmanship. I found it enormously frustrating, but that was your role. You did it to the best of anyone's ability. Kerry, I have not had the chance to argue with you as much as I would have liked, but that is because you have been very busy. You both have had very different roles in this place. It would not have functioned without you. The breadth of experience that you both have brought here has facilitated making this chamber something special and what it is—a real representation of the people. I think that is great.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I would like to confine my comments more specifically to Senator Wortley, because Senator Wortley and I go back quite some way. I can expose that Senator Wortley has very poor judgment in the sense that she told her colleagues when I came here that I was all right. Yes, I am all right in the sense that there is not much Left in me, but I am not sure they would say I am all right right now, Senator Wortley. I will explain how we came to that in a moment.

                      <p>
                       Senator Wortley also had the esteemed position of leading a union of which I was once a member. This will horrify those on that side, but in a very short-lived acting career I joined the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance for a week I think. I made it to the cutting room floor and I once saw myself on German television. That was the extent of my career there. I actually owned a pub next to where Senator Wortley worked. The

                       went on strike. The workers were out the back in the lane on strike boycotting everything. In true sympathy with the people who used to patronise my business I took out hot pizzas to ensure that they were happy and healthy while they were going about their strike, hoping that they would get thirsty and come in and buy a drink. A few of them did. One particularly militant Scottish Communist—that is the only way I can describe him, and it was not

                       —came in and started giving me a lecture about taking advantage of the workers and saying that I should close my pub in sympathy with them, and things like that. I took umbrage at this because I was only trying to help them and be a good humanitarian. I made sure that every pizza that went out after that had three times the amount of salt on it so they would get very thirsty. It was a very good day of business. Dana, thank you very much for your contribution to my business in that regard.

                      <p>
                       It has been a pleasure to be with Dana because not only is she a colleague who goes back a long way with me and my family but she has been very generous to my wife, and our kids have been at school together. I wish you, Russell and Che every success in whatever you choose to do. It has been a real honour and a pleasure to be one of your colleagues here.

                        I want to rise and acknowledge the retirement of my three colleagues and make a few brief remarks about each. This place is an odd place to come and spend so much time in because often the work and the contribution that is made by individuals is never acknowledged except perhaps in these last speeches. Each of the three senators who is retiring tonight has made a very special contribution in different ways to the Labor Party and to those of us who were in opposition for so many years and latterly in government. I want to talk about their special contributions.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Firstly, the person whom I have known for the least time is, of course,
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Wortley" rel="nofollow">
                         Dana Wortley
                        </a>
                        from
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                         South Australia
                        </a>
                        . In fact, I have not worked on a committee with Dana and have only observed her work in passing. But the very special contribution that she made in this place was one of cooperation and camaraderie. Someone made a reference earlier to the fact that often in late-night sittings it was Dana's office that we attended for drinks and an exchange of views. But more special than that, Dana has the ability to bring people together because she is always first on the phone to issue an invitation and to organise a social function, particularly in those last three years when we were in opposition when she first came here.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Dana contributed by bringing others in and by binding them to a wider group and a wider organisation. She was always most helpful, most cheerful and most pleasant in those endeavours as she was always in her work in this place. She made special reference tonight to her husband and her son, and of course that was from the heart. I wish her well when she returns to Adelaide, because often when we were out to dinner of an evening she would take a phone call from her son and you could see the gleam in her eyes and the pleasure as she spoke to him. I wish her very well in her retirement.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Turning now to

                         Kerry O'Brien
                        </a>
                        , oddly enough, given the large amount of work that Kerry has done since I came to this place in 1996, I do not think we have ever worked together on a committee. Kerry chose an area of endeavour which has been referred to by others and I do not think we ever managed to share any sessions together where you get to know each other much better than you do in other ways. My own observation from when I was on the frontbench of the Labor Party from 1998 through to 2006—and I think Kerry was there in one role or another all of those years but in different areas: agriculture, forestry, fisheries, transport, tourism for a while, regional development and regional affairs—was that he was always prepared. He never spoke off the cuff. His remarks were always judicious, they were always considered, they were suited to the legitimate interests of the group he might be advocating for and, best of all, they always had a political edge. They had merit in terms of the contribution to the particular group but there was always a useful political take on whatever the issue of the day was. So to Kerry as he retires I also wish him well.

They used to be very supportive of me in various endeavours in different forums in the labour movement in that state. Through them I got to know Michael when he used to come over to Western Australia in relation to various dis­putes and various other sets of negotiations.

                        I noted back in the middle eighties that Michael was always a person who listened, a person who consulted and a person who gave consideration before deciding on a particular course of action. When I came here in 1996 he had been here for two or three years beforehand and again his strengths were along those lines. Michael is a person who has some of the strengths that serious negotiators often overlook. When he went into a negotiation he had always worked out your position, your true interests or where an outcome that would suit all interests might be achieved, and he would work towards that. He had a very useful ability to negotiate. He had a very useful ability to seek a compromise and to know when a deal was on the table, to stitch it on, get out of the room and move onto something else. In that context he always had the ability to understand what was critical or important in a particular negotiation and what was more peripheral and of not so much consequence. That was the contribution that he brought to this place.

                        As I said at the outset, each of three retiring senators from our side brought a different contribution. They brought a remarkable strength. In a lot of ways the contribution they made was not properly recognised or understood. Often it was underappreciated and undervalued, particularly in respect of Senator O'Brien who made a contribution in an area of work which is not natural to many Labor Party people but which he got on top of and worked hard at—as I said, he was always well briefed. The particular piece of bastardry that undid him under the former Prime Minister was noted by a lot of people in this place and should not go unremarked because the treatment dished out was not appropriate. But in respect of all three colleagues, I thank them for their assistance to me over the years and the time they have spent. I wish them well as they retire and spend more time with their families.

                         when I came here in 2005. I had the pleasure of sitting next to my great mate Hutcho, and to my side were Hoggie and Michael. I could not believe how Michael could come out with such witty interjections so quickly. When we came over to this side of the chamber, I escaped and went up the other end. I thought, 'You beauty, I misbehaved and I'm back down next to him still enjoying his interjections!' Michael, thanks mate. I am not going to say I am going to miss you, because I am looking forward to you coming to Perth, where we are going to have a whack of a golf ball and blow the top off a few frothies. I will also miss our conversations in question time on 'who sung that song', but that is between us. Michael, good luck, mate.

Kerry asked questions from nine o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night for four full days—and first thing Monday morning he let the chair know that he was going to have a spillover day on the Friday. I have never seen anything like it since. Kerry, we are going to miss you on that committee, and I am going to miss you as a mate. I look forward to you joining me in the Kimberley again for another sojourn in your retirement, when we can swap tall stories again.

                            As a relatively new senator, I thought this would be the appropriate time to speak. We have had three fantastic speeches tonight which reflected brilliantly on all three senators not just professionally in their time in the Senate but also personally in terms of their values, their principles and the work they have achieved.

                            As a new senator, the first whip I encountered was Senator O'Brien. He and his office gave me support in learning the ropes in this place. It is not easy for new senators to learn the ropes, but Kerry was always there to provide me with the advice I needed in terms of debates and speaking. I truly appreciate that. I too acknowledge the work that Kerry did in his shadow portfolio. When I was not in this place but working in the party office with numerous shadow ministers, I saw the hard yards he did in terms of policy development and also in terms of building relationships with key stakeholders and lobby groups. A lot of the stakeholders in the area he was fighting were not traditionally Labor people. These were people who had a long-term distrust of the Labor Party. Kerry was able to turn that around and show that the Labor Party represents everybody—not just the people in the cities, but the people in the regions and in the country as well. Kerry, I thank you for the work you did in that portfolio; you set a very high standard. I agree with my other colleagues that you deserve to be a minister, and that will not be forgotten.

                              and I have known each other only a very short time, but I think her smile lightens up the Senate. Dana, I have seen you speak on numerous occasions in the chamber. You are passionate about what you believe in. You are passionate about improving the lives of workers and people who are powerless. We did a bit of work together in the area of child protection, and I know how passionate you are. It has been lovely working with you and I really do wish you well in the future.

                              Right convenor he has done a huge amount of backroom work. He gets little gratification for that in terms of public acceptance, but the work he has done has been so effective. To me, he has been a trusted person in whom I can confide and he has always given me support. At the same time, he has been a peacemaker in this place. There are so often disputes between factions and individuals, and Michael is always the person we go to to try and resolve them. He has also been wise counsel in some difficult times over the past couple of years. Michael, we really do appreciate this—from a factional perspective but also from a party perspective. We have worked on numerous campaigns together, from the Sutherland by-election right through to the Cunningham by-election. Many we have lost, but we have learnt from those losses, and many we have gone on to win.

                              Tonight you made reference to Jan, and I know a number of other senators made reference to her. You really are a team. Jan has done so much work for the Labor Party and so much work for her constituents in Sutherland. She got the largest vote in the council election, and that is no surprise because she is someone who truly represents her community. I know you have done a great deal together and her face will be missed in this chamber.

                              As a senator, Michael, you have generously stepped back on a number of occasions. You could have taken a ministry or a parliamentary secretary position, but you have always worked to put the party first and that is something that I and everyone else appreciates. There are two areas where you will be remembered from inside the party. One is as a duty senator. Senator Abetz referred to the amount of work you have done as a senator and on the ground. You have taken that role and have pursued it seriously. You have represented so many people in your constituency, not just

                              projects that you have been to—what can I say? You are probably the best judge in the country because you have been to more BER projects than any other senator or member—and I know that firsthand. If you say it is a good program, it is a good program, because you know; you have seen it. From all the party members and constituents in those duty electorates—Hughes, Paterson, Cowper and Wentworth—thank you for the work you have done, but I know you have done a huge amount for the whole of the

                              Last is the work you have done on committees. You have done a great deal of work on all committees, but the chairman­ship of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is probably your legacy. I was a new senator who came onto that committee and I could see the workload you would undertake. The relationships you formed with ambassadors, visiting dignitaries and officers of the

                              were truly outstanding. You leave this Senate with an outstanding knowledge of foreign affairs, defence and trade and that record is second to none. That work really should be acknowledged. I know it is something you have a deep interest in. You talked before about the policy issues in the area. You have a deep understanding of that area, particularly the issue of human rights. I thank you for the work you have done in foreign affairs.

                               I join with all of my colleagues who have made remarks about the retirement of Senators O'Brien, Wortley and Forshaw. I consider all of them my friends. In some ways that might be a bit surprising. When I first entered the Senate three years ago I was appointed deputy whip and had to work with Senator O'Brien. We came from quite different factional backgrounds but, I think to our surprise, we got on like a house on fire. I very much appreciate the time I spent as deputy whip with Kerry, because he taught me lots of things. I was amazed at all the procedure he knew about the operation of the Senate and I very much appreciated the generous way in which he was prepared to pass on that knowledge to me.

                               —but everybody makes mistakes and we can forgive Kerry for that. I wish him all the best in life after the Senate and look forward to coming down and having a look at that vineyard of his and trying some of those magnificent wines he is producing down there.

                               Senator Forshaw was a factional ally. His reputation preceded my appointment to the Senate. I worked with him in a less formal Senate role as a convenor. I learnt lots about how you deal with the difficult issues and the personality issues of the parliament and found that he had a solution to every problem. That is not always easy in politics, but anybody who has that ability will no doubt do very well in life after politics and I am sure Mike will be in that category.

                               is playing right at this moment in her office. It has been tremendous working with you, Dana. I know the sacrifices you made through having a young family in coming to the Senate, but you did it willingly. You have always been the life of the party around here and you are very much going to be missed. So good luck in your life after the Senate.
