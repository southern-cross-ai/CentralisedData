        My question without notice is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . Can the minister confirm that the Howard government has slashed renewable energy research programs, closing down the Energy Research and

        </a>
        and the Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program? Isn’t it a fact that there is now almost no federal funding for research into renewable energy technologies? Isn’t this why many world-leading renewable technologies that originated in Australia, like the evacuated tubes for solar hot water, solar thermal concentrators and silver cells for solar electricity, have been forced overseas? Why has the Howard government abandoned Australia’s world-leading research into renewable energy and forced our leading scientists to go overseas?

         The brief answer to the honourable senator’s question is no, but allow me to expand on it. Comprehensive strategies are in place, underpinned by almost $3.5 billion worth of investment, contributing to an 87 million tonne a year cut in emissions by 2010. Recently announced initiatives by the Howard government have included $336 million for green vouchers for schools and $252 million for solar hot water rebates et cetera. We also have invested $15 million in the FutureGen International Partnership. We have invested $70.7 million as follows: $5 million for the Asia-Pacific Network for Energy Technology, $50 million to support further action through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APP" rel="nofollow">
          APP
         </a>
         and $15.7 million for increased regional expertise in forest management. The list goes on.

        <p>
         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         can try and make the claim, as it does all the time, that somehow it has been the champion of climate change. The simple facts are these: we were the ones who introduced the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greenhouse_Office" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greenhouse Office
         </a>
         in 1998. Thereafter, there were literally years when a full 12 months would go by without the Labor Party asking a single question about climate change or global warming. Indeed, if you do a search of
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         from 1998 up until May 2007, you will find that the vast majority of questions in this area have in fact been asked by coalition senators. The only time that the Labor Party have asked more questions on this issue than the coalition has in fact been in the last 12 months.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why I coined the phrase ‘Kevin’s come lately to this issue’. It was only with Mr Rudd that they finally decided that this might be an issue. Before that, we as a government had been developing policies and investing Australian taxpayers’ dollars to ensure that we were well positioned around the world in relation to these issues. We have done that, and we have a very good record. All I would suggest to Senator Carr is that, rather than accepting questions from the question time committee—

I ask the minister, again, if he could answer the question about the closure of these research programs and the government’s policy to force Australian scientists overseas. I further ask: is the minister aware that Pacific Solar sold the rights to its silicon-on-glass technology to a German firm which is now developing and commercialising this technology? Don’t Australians now have to import evacuated tubes for solar hot water from China, even though this technology was first developed at the

That is why we have the raft of investments that I just referred the honourable senator to. But, of course, what happens is that you have a pre-written supplementary question which has to be prattled out, irrespective of the answer that is given. That is the difficulty that the
