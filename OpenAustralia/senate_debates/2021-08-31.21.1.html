        ABETZ () (): [by video link] Some time ago, I was critical of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        's service delivery standards, noting specific examples of where Australia Post could do better. Part of the criticism was of its unilateral decision to refuse to continue to deliver perishable goods. In my home state of Tasmania, Australia Post's decision caused uncertainty, dislocation and job insecurity. Having achieved a moratorium on the decision, the small-business ombudsman,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Billson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , was called in to help develop a solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        The good news is that a solution has been found, with Australia Post committing itself to continuing to deliver perishable goods across Australia. Many jobs are dependent on getting our fine products to market. Individual purchasers' buying habits are now more internet based, with direct sales going from producer to the door. Australia Post's reconsideration of their duty is much appreciated by both producers and consumers. The decision means Tasmanian businesses like Tasmanian Gourmet Online, Ashgrove Cheese and 41 Degrees South can continue to have their highly sought after, premium-quality products delivered to their discerning consumers. Food safety issues have been worked through exceptionally carefully to ensure perishable products arrive in a manner ensuring consumer safety. Australia Post can again truly say about its service: 'We deliver.' On behalf of Tasmania's premium food sector workers, whose jobs depend on a safe, reliable service delivery, a big thank you to all involved in overcoming this impasse. It has secured jobs, families and communities in my home state of Tasmania.
