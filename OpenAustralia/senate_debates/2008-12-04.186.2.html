        Mr Temporary Chairman, the running sheet shows that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_First" rel="nofollow">

        will be moving the first amendment. But
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        has just left the chamber to get some notes so, while he is doing that, can I briefly explain where the opposition is at. We are delighted that the government has seen the sense of the amendments which both the opposition and Family First, in different ways, have proposed. We were very concerned with the bill, as it came to us, about the indexation of the fuel tax. Senators will remember that Prime Minister Keating introduced a provision for the automatic indexation of fuel tax. Fuel tax used to go up every half-year and it was a great impost on Australians. The Howard government, to its great credit, got rid of that indexation. We wanted to make sure that the Labor Party did not reintroduce it, by stealth, in the bill before the chamber. As I said, both the opposition and Family First have proposed amendments in relation to indexation and in relation to it being a disallowable instrument. We wanted to make sure that, if the road user charge were to be increased in the years ahead, it would have to come before this parliament and would be subject to disallowance. It was not in the original bill but, again, the government has picked up the amendments of both the opposition and Family First and has made it a ministerial determination—and the ministerial determination is said to be a disallowable instrument.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have just distributed a revised amendment sheet on behalf of the opposition. This follows some discussion between me and Family First and government officials. In this second set of amendments we have simply taken our amendments that will not be required off the piece of paper because we are going to be agreeing, first of all, with Senator Fielding’s first amendment and then with all of the government amendments, which pick up the issue of indexation by ensuring it is not indexed and the other issue of a disallowable instrument. The new opposition amendments are simply the old ones put differently.
       </p>
       <p>
        For explanation, particularly for Family First and Senator Xenophon, we are proceeding with our amendment which on the original sheet was shown as opposition amendment (2) but on the new sheet is shown as opposition amendment (4). We have removed amendments (1), (2) and (3) and now only have opposition amendment (4). We have done that in the hope that either the government or the crossbenchers will agree with us on one or all of those provisions, whereas they may not agree on other positions. I see that Senator Fielding is now here and I assume the Senate will be happy if we now move according to the running sheet.

        <p>
         This is about a review of the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program which the government has announced and has allocated $70 million for additional truck stops, which is good news. The amendment is pretty straightforward. It says that the minister must cause a review of the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program to be conducted and says when the review should start. It says that there must be a written report prepared and that a copy of that report must be laid before each house of parliament. That is very important so that we can ascertain how this productivity program has progressed and also have a review of it. It is a very important program and I am hoping that all senators will support this amendment as this review is important to make sure that we look at what else needs to be done in the future.

          for moving it. I think having a review of the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program is worth while. In relation to this issue I am grateful for the briefings from the minister’s office, and I have put the case that I think it is important with respect to the moneys being raised in part for a safety program for truck stops. It is important that this be rolled out as soon as possible. I put it very clearly to the minister and the minister’s office that I am concerned that in my home state of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          , which has about 8½ per cent of the population but takes up about 15 per cent of the national freight travelling through, it is important that this program be rolled out and that South Australia get a fair share of that in terms of appropriate truck stops.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the lead-up to Christmas last year I went to Bordertown to visit a number of local community groups that were running a voluntary truck stop or rest stop. A lot of them were ex-truck drivers and operators and they were quite despondent about the lack of truck stops in their neck of the woods. I commend the government for ensuring that there will be significant funds to deal with this issue on a national level and I commend Senator Fielding for moving this particular amendment.

             I also indicate that the government opposes schedule 3 in the following terms:

             <b>

            <p class="italic">
             Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000—
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             This is a bill imposing taxation within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
              The Senate
             </a>
             may not amend a bill imposing taxation and therefore, any amendments to the bill must be moved as requests. This is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first one is a minor drafting amendment describing how fuel tax credit is removed by the transport minister after the road user charge. The second one is a minor amendment that opposes item 3 of the bill, which would have formerly defined a road user charge. This reference is no longer needed given the definition that will be found in government amendment (4).
            </p>
            <p>
             The third one changes the heading and is a consequence of reverting the adjustment of the rate of the road user charge back for ministerial determination. The fourth one is a consequence of removing the ability to automatically index the rate of the charge by regulation to a determination by the transport minister. The fifth one removes the ability to automatically index the rate of charge by regulation to a determination by the transport minister.
            </p>
            <p>
             The sixth one reverts the setting of a road user charge to that of a determination by the transport minister rather than by regulation, in response to concerns by industry and by senators about indexation by regulation. The effect of the amendment is to ensure that any variations to the rate of the road user charge must be brought back to parliament for scrutiny through a disallowable instrument.
            </p>
            <p>
             The seventh one, subsection 8, replaces the ability to make regulations that may index the rate of the road user charge with a provision that allows the transport minister to determine a rate by disallowable legislative instrument. The effect of this subclause is to ensure that any variation to the rate of the road user charge must be brought back to parliament for scrutiny through a disallowable instrument. It also provides a new subsection 9, which establishes two conditions that must be met by the transport minister in making a determination to vary the rate.
            </p>
            <p>
             The eighth is a 60-day consultation period where the minister must make the proposed rates and any information used in this calculation publicly available for a period of public consultation and must consider any comments received from the public. It provides a new subsection 10, which provides that the minister may at the conclusion of the consultation period vary the rate of the charge from that originally proposed without needing to reconvene another 60-day consultation process. The clause reinserts definitions of ‘transport minister’, ‘transport secretary’ and ‘transport department’. The bill proposed to repeal them because they were no longer necessary. This amendment reinserts them because the determination to vary the rate of road user charges is to be made by the transport minister and this needs to be defined.

              As I indicated before, the opposition will be supporting the government’s amendments because they have picked up amendments that had been flagged by the opposition. We will not now be proceeding with our amendments because the government’s amendments to its amendment bill pick up those things.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
               Can I
              </a>
              just make it clear to the chamber, though, that what we are doing today is agreeing to a legislative increase of the road user charge from 19-odd cents a litre to 21c a litre. The opposition is totally opposed to any increases in taxes and we did a bit of soul searching before coming to the decision that we would support what is effectively an increase in tax by the Labor government. We have recognised that a lot of work needs to be done on the roads insofar as the transport industry is concerned. We have particularly recognised that a lot of money needs to be spent on rest areas, or truck stops—call them what you will. So, on the basis that this increase in tax will be spent appropriately to help the trucking industry, we have—as I say, somewhat reluctantly—agreed to the increase. The bill and the amendments moved by the government provide that the rate will, I think on the bill receiving royal assent, go up to 21c a litre from the 19-odd cents that it now is.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the other amendments that the opposition will continue to press, we want to make sure that, in the future, any increases in the road user charge are spent on these rest stops. I do not want to go through our amendments now, except to flag that the reason we are agreeing with the 21c is that we want the bill to say that any future increases must be spent on rest areas. We also want to provide that the road user charges do ensure a degree of harmonisation between the various state regimes, which currently are all over shop. There are some stupid examples that have been mentioned in this chamber by many senators over a long period of time. We want to make sure that that harmonisation stands. So our amendments again ensure that the government are only going to get this extra money if they help the trucking industry with some of the difficulties they have encountered.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have also agreed with this on the basis that indexation is never, ever to be used. The government’s amendments, which we support, just say that there is ministerial discretion. We have an amendment coming up later that puts it beyond doubt that, in looking at future increases, the minister must not use any reference to indexation. We are also going to move an amendment later that reflects that, in giving support for this, we want it confirmed that the transport minister will not make more than one determination a year. Hopefully he will not make any determinations—so it will not go up—but, if he does make a determination to increase it, there cannot be more than one increase a year. I think the minister will tell us later that that is the intention. My argument will be: if that is the intention, let us put it in the act so that it is clear to everyone.
             </p>
             <p>
              The third amendment we are putting forward—and I will explain it now because it is relevant to the whole thing—is an amendment that says, because this is now a disallowable instrument, we do not want the situation where the government brings in an instrument that says the road user charge is increased by 1c to 22c and the Senate and the House of Representatives have 15 sitting days to disallow that increase. The 15 sitting days, as we all know, may take two, three or four months to reach. We want to make sure that the government do not start collecting the additional 1c from day one, which they are entitled to do under the ministerial determination, and then find two months later that the Senate has knocked it off and they have to give back the 1c a litre to anyone who has paid it over that period of time. This is similar to the alcopops issue, as senators might recall: ‘If the Senate knocks these off, what do the government do with the money they have collected?’ With our third amendment we want to say, ‘If you put it up, fine, but let’s leave the collection until after the 15 days allowed for the Senate to disallow it have expired.’ Again, that seems sensible and appropriate.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have mentioned those opposition amendments because it is on the basis of those amendments that the opposition has agreed to this increase in the road user charge at the present time.

                   I have briefly mentioned what are now amendments (1), (2) and (3). I have explained them but, if the government has an opposition to them and indicates that opposition, I will perhaps take the argument further. Suffice to say, we just want it made absolutely clear that indexation will not be used. In the second amendment, we want to make it absolutely clear that the government cannot do more than one determination in a financial year. In amendment (3)—and I think we are doing this more or less to help the government in the administration of this whole scheme—we want to make sure that if the charge does go up it is not actually collected until after the 15-day disallowance period. That just seems to make good common sense and will not leave us in the situation where we would have been with the increased excise on alcopops. I hope those three amendments are relatively simple to understand, and I will not take the time of the Senate by arguing them further at this stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I will move on to amendment (4) and explain it particularly to the crossbenchers. This amendment accepts that, at the moment, the road user charge has gone up to 21c. This amendment talks about the rate of the road user charge in the future. The amendment says the rate of the road user charge must not be increased unless certain things happen. Paragraph (a) lists one of those things—what we call the net figure—and says: ‘the net figure has increased since the date the existing road user charge became effective’. I refer senators to the first paragraph of our amendment (4), which defines what the net figure is. Effectively, without going into a very technical description, the net figure is the figure that represents the difference between what has been collected from the trucking industry by federal, state and local governments over the relevant period minus what has been spent on roads by all levels of government in that same period. We are saying that we have to show that the governments are spending more on roads, fixing them up, than they are collecting in revenue from the trucking industry. It is one way—quite a clever way, I might say to those who drafted this for the shadow minister in the other house—of making sure that these funds do go to help the trucking industry.

                  <p>
                   Paragraph (b) of amendment (4) says:

                  <p>
                   I know other senators and other parties are very keen about heavy vehicle safety—the minister has made speeches about this—and the provision of rest areas. I think all senators understand that the national guidelines for the provision of rest areas, facilitated by the National Transport Commission in 2005, require a major rest area every 100 kilometres, with sufficient parking for 20 trucks. They also provide that there must be a minor rest area every 50 kilometres, with parking for up to 10 trucks, and a truck parking bay every 30 kilometres with enough space for four or five trucks so that their drivers can do safety checks.

                   Senators would know that independent government research agency Austroads recently audited Australia’s major highways against those guidelines. The report released in March this year showed that none of the audited routes met the national guidelines and 60 per cent of the audited routes had substantial deficiencies. There were particular problems in my home state of Queensland and in the

                   in the Northern Territory. Only about half of the major rest areas on the Hume and Pacific highways met the spacing requirements of the guidelines. Because we are pressed for time, I will not elaborate on that. I am sure that all senators taking part in this debate understand how awful the position is on rest areas and how difficult it is for truck drivers to get the proper rest and proper facilities that they need.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Our proposed section 43-15(2)(b) requires that an average of at least 50 additional heavy vehicle rest areas be constructed each year. Some may say, ‘How do you prove that?’ If you look down to proposed subsection (2)(e), you will see that we are requiring Infrastructure Australia—the body that has just been set up by the government and which is completely and absolutely independent, or so we have been told—to be the judge of whether 50 additional heavy vehicle rest areas have been constructed each year. It is a workable way of ensuring that the heavy vehicle rest areas, which I know all senators support, are actually built. Too often over history we have seen governments putting up taxes and charges, saying, ‘We are going to use those for good purposes,’ and the moneys just getting lost in general revenue, just becoming another revenue source, and not going to where the problem is. We want to make sure through these requests—and I do not think that the government could argue with them—that the promise to construct these rest areas is actually carried out and provided for in the act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In proposed subsection (2)(c) of request (4) we talk about the type of rest areas being ‘consistent with the goal that rest areas in the National Land Transport Network comply with the recommendations’ in the national guidelines for the provision of rest areas that I mentioned previously. In this way, we can make sure that happens. In proposed subsection (2)(d), we are saying that road user charges cannot increase unless ‘substantial harmonisation has been achieved in state and territory transport regulations, including heavy vehicle fatigue reform measures’. All state governments and the federal government have agreed that there must be harmonisation. I think that the government will say to us, ‘Look, substantial harmonisation is already happening.’ We concede that there have been some moves towards it. But what we want to ensure by this legislation is not just a state government saying, ‘Yes, we’re gonna do it; we’re gonna do it.’ We want to have some control over the fact that they actually do it, so we are putting in this provision about substantial harmonisation. You may well ask, ‘How are you going to judge that?’ Again, we are asking Infrastructure Australia to make the assessment of whether there has been substantial harmonisation. If the government are telling us that there is substantial harmonisation then they will not in any way object to this clause going in—because, as they say, it is happening anyhow. This will just give us the confidence that it is there.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The next provision of request (4) is about Infrastructure Australia having to look at the previous three things I mentioned. I will not spend any more time on that. It seems to me that that is a reasonable and practical way of ensuring that any increase in the tax is properly spent. Proposed subsections (2)(f) and (2)(g) relate not to the road user charge as such but back to proposed subsection (1)—that net figure. Putting it in shorthand, that is the difference between what all governments collect from the trucking industry less what all governments pay in construction of facilities for the trucking industry. Proposed subsections (f) and (g) are just saying that to get to that figure you have to do some calculations. We are just saying that the minister must release the details of how he came to the net figure. That seems quite reasonable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Proposed subsection (3) of request (4) says that the details of what the Commonwealth, states and territories spend on roads have to be verified by the Auditor-General. That is a reasonable request. We take the states’ words for it, providing it is confirmed by the Auditor-General. That seems to be a reasonable request. Proposed subsection (4) is simply definitions of ‘government expenditure’ and ‘government revenue’ in relation to that net figure I spoke about. It can be read by senators, but ‘government expenditure’:

                   Again, it is a doable and practical way of getting to that figure. ‘Government revenue’ is defined as:

                   I think requests (1), (2) and (3) are uncontroversial, and I would urge all other senators to support them. Request (4) is really just making sure that the extra moneys charged do not get lost in consolidated revenue but are actually spent on the highways. We also, by the same provision, want to make sure that we move towards harmonisation. The government will say, ‘We are only going to spend any increase on these things anyhow and we are going to have harmonisation.’ My urging to them is this: you are going to do it anyway, so why not put it in the bill so that we can all be assured that that will happen?

                    I indicate on behalf of the government that we will not be supporting request (1), we are happy to support (2) and we will not be supporting (3) or (4). I will briefly speak to our position on those as a collective. Request (4) has ambiguous terminology and lacks detail. For example, ‘other charges’ could be interpreted to include tolls and environmental charges that are not related to road construction costs. The

                    </a>
                    uses a seven-year averaging of road expenditure to soften the impact of spikes in road funding, strongly supported by industry. This amendment jeopardises that. It is unnecessary: all information associated with the charges, including precise definitions, will be defined in the determination and consultation process.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The government has identified rest stops as an important issue for the industry and moved to act. The government has already committed, with the passage of this bill, to a $70 million heavy vehicle safety and productivity package which will provide heavy vehicle rest stops. The minister has already written to industry and the states seeking their views as to where the rest stops should be. Those submissions have been provided. It is bad policy to link adjustment of the charge in the future to the construction of an arbitrary number of rest stops. The road user charge is determined based on all road expenditure attributable to heavy vehicles, not just rest stops. Also, putting in an arbitrary quantitative target such as 50 only encourages expenditure on smaller projects to meet the target. There is no logic or transparency to why 50 a year has been chosen.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Claiming that this bill can force the states to harmonise inconsistent transport law is an absolute furphy. There is no logical reason to link road user charge adjustment to harmonisation of transport law. This process has absolutely no impact on the states and will place no pressure on states at all. All the revenue from this bill comes to the Commonwealth. The Rudd government is pursuing national transport law in the heavy vehicle area through the ministerial council process.

                      On request (3), determinations so made have effect until they are disallowed. The minister will propose the date of effect with each determination. It is better to have the flexibility to determine date of effect. Finally, it is unnecessary. The consultation process would contain the relevant information, including road expenditure. The act already defines application of the road user charge.

                       Request (4) has got something that is fairly important in regard to additional truck rest stops or rest areas. I wonder whether the minister could give us a bit of a feel on the $70 million for the government’s heavy vehicle safety and productivity package. It may also help some listeners listening in on this. Roughly how many truck stops would that be on an average? I know some take a lot and some take a little. Can you give us a bit of a feel for that $70 million? I know it is split over the forward forecast of $10 million in 2008-09, $20 million in 2009-10, $20 million in 2010-11 and another $20 million in 2011-12. Can you outline it for us?

                        I am advised that a large truck stop can cost around $5 million and a small one around $500,000. It does vary depending on each individual site that is chosen.

                             I am trying to think ahead. This is where I have some sympathy with the opposition’s request because it is talking about additional heavy vehicle rest areas to be done before the next increase. What I am worried about is that if another increase comes no more money is being spent on rest stops other than the $70 million. The $70 million is tied to the 21c increase. If you actually increase the charge again, I would have expected the government to have some commitment to additional funding on rest areas above the $70 million. The issue is a fairly significant one, given that the Transport Commission, as highlighted before, issued a set of national guidelines about the provision of rest areas, and an audit of major highways found that none of the highways met the guidelines—none. What I am concerned about is that the $70 million probably falls very short. Even though it is welcomed and definitely the industry welcomes the $70 million, I am worried about future road charge increases and then no corresponding commitment to additional funds above the $70 million for rest stops and truck stops. This is a safety issue for all Australians who use the roads. We all get concerned about it. It is an issue that I have had people come to me about in relation to extra rest stops and truck stops. I would like to know whether the minister is going to reassure us. This is what the coalition have picked up here, the additional rest areas, and that is why they have gone for, say, an additional 50 not just for the first part of the increase but if there are ongoing increases.

                              —I think I have got it—and I would probably say that, because of other amendments, it is not just automatically indexed; it is now going to be voted on by the Senate. At this stage there isn’t a proposal on the table to increase it. It is a little hard for us to allocate money to a future increase when we have not got a future increase.

                              I think the point you are trying to make is that if there were to be an increase in the future there should be an increase in funding. I think that is the point you are trying to get to. What I would probably say is that, given that it is a disallowable instrument, I am sure the Senate would take a view about the level of funding for road stops into consideration when deciding how to vote on the increase in the charge. But it is a little hard for us to talk about future increases in money for roadside stops when we do not have a proposal for a future increase at this stage. I am not sure that there is much more that I can suggest.

                               I will give you a different explanation to the one the minister has given you. What this is saying is that we are increasing it today from 19-odd cents to 21c, so they are getting a lot of extra money. They have promised to use that on rest stops. What our amendment is saying is, ‘When you come back to us in a couple of years and want to increase that, we’re telling you now that we’re not going to increase that beyond the 21c unless you can show us that, for this year and for next year and for however many years it is until you come back to us, you have actually done what you have been talking about.’
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               You have been talking about 50 truck stops or $70 million—which we calculate to be 50. That is what you are promising to do today, and we take you at your word. But just because we are a little bit suspicious we are actually giving you notice in today’s bill not to come back to us in three years time looking for an increase unless you can prove to us that you have put in, on average, 50 truck stops a year. I say to the government: you are telling us that you are going to do that and we believe you, so why would you not agree to this being in there?
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               While I am on that, perhaps Senator Conroy is right when he says that
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                               is not the appropriate body. Senator Conroy said to the Senate that there are more appropriate bodies. You are the government, so you have a team of advisers, whereas we have practically none, so you tell us what the body should be that assesses it and I will make the amendment on my feet as we go. We picked Infrastructure Australia because it was supposedly absolutely independent. We did not expect

                               to go out with his tape measure and measure up these truck stops, but we assumed that it would have some staff and a budget and it could employ contractors to go out and measure them up. But, if it is not the appropriate body, tell me which one is and I will seek the leave of the Senate to delete Infrastructure Australia and put in its place Senator Conroy’s suggestion as to who is right for it. That would overcome that.

                              <p>
                               I do not want to take it any further except to say that we are giving them an extra 2c a litre today on the basis that they have promised us they are going to build 50 truck stops every year for the next several years. We are just giving them notice with this amendment, which says, ‘Look, brother, don’t come back to us for an increase in four years time unless you can demonstrate to us that you have done the 50 truck stops a year and you have harmonised the state regulations.’ If you come back in four years and want to increase it to 23c a litre and you do your disallowable instrument for it, we could knock it off, as Senator Conroy said, but putting it in the bill in this way today makes it indelibly clear. The minister will not even be able to put in a determination in four years time unless Infrastructure Australia, or some other body, has said to the parliament: ‘These guys were true to their word. They have done the 50 a year. They have substantially harmonised with the states and territories, so you can therefore put in your determination.’ We can then knock it off for other reasons, but what we are saying is: don’t even bother with the determination unless Infrastructure Australia has told us that you have honoured your pledge to give us 50 truck stops a year and you have substantially harmonised.

                                I will state in less than two minutes my position in relation to the four requests moved by the opposition. In relation to request (1), I see no harm in that; I see it as further clarifying what the position is in terms of definitional matters. In relation to request (2), which concerns there being not more than one determination in a financial year, I think that is fair enough and it gives, in a sense, some certainty to the industry that there will only be one determination per year. I support that measure. In relation to request (3), the amendment concerns the disallowable instrument. The difference is between not being able to raise the funds until 15 days, the time under the Legislative Instruments Act, has passed, or raising it now—the alcopops situation that Senator Macdonald has referred to. My question to the minister in relation to that is: what happens if, with respect to the government’s position, for some reason the Senate disallows that amount? Will there be a refund with respect to that? What actually happens with the funds that were already collected if, 15 days later, the Senate disallows it?

                                 s are the relevant bodies to deal with that. There seems to be a little bit of confusion that the 2c is directly linked to the road stops or the harmonisation. This is not the case. They are not directly linked. The government has made the commitment that it will build these road stops in an ongoing manner. They are not tied together in the way that Senator Macdonald is trying to tie them together. As I have already mentioned, the funding for these comes from

                                 For Senator Xenophon, a disallowable instrument is a legal instrument until it is disallowed. I have done this myself. I disallowed an accounting standard, as funny as you may find that. In the 14-odd days that it took to disallow it, one company in particular, who was a major beneficiary of the change in the accounting standard, was able to conduct its business. This actually then went to court and the judge ruled that a disallowable instrument stands until it is disallowed by the Senate. So it has full force of law until it is disallowed.

Whilst I am quite sympathetic to the opposition’s amendments moved by Senator Macdonald in relation to subclause 3, my concern is that there could be some administrative complexity with respect to that. I have discussed that privately with Senator Macdonald. We still have the mechanism of disallowing it. I am just worried about what would occur in the context of the consultation and all the steps that are required by having that 15-day period. I just think that is unduly onerous. If the Senate are minded to knock this out, they can do so well within that 15-day period. The flip side of it is that we can deal with it earlier. Presumably, if the new charges are so obnoxious, the majority of the Senate will get its act together and get onto it. So I cannot support that.

                                  In relation to subclause 4, I understand the intent of what is being moved by the coalition. My concern is that the conditions, the trip-wires, that have been set up here are simply too prescriptive. I think that the government will be judged by what it does with this money and by the commitments that are made. I think the danger is that if we are simply too prescriptive about, for example, the meaning of ‘substantial harmonisation’—this is the sort of stuff that we lawyers salivate about; it is judicial review—it will not be a lawyers picnic but a lawyers smorgasbord. I am concerned, but I commend Senator Macdonald for raising this. There are some legitimate concerns. I think, simply by raising them, it really sets on the agenda the sorts of things that need to be considered. But making it that prescriptive is something that concerns me. I can just see it fraught with a number of legal minefields. In summary, my position is that I support the first and second amendments of the coalition, but I cannot support the third and fourth.

                                   I refer back to Senator Xenophon’s last question to the minister. I think we all knew that legislative instruments take effect from the day they are signed. But I thought Senator Xenophon asked you: what happens to all the money you collect if, within the 15 days, the Senate knocks that off? Once you increase the price of the fuel, every truckie, as he goes into the servo, will pay the increase. If it is knocked off in 15 working days of the Senate, which could well be two or three months down the track, what happens to that money? Are you going to give it back to every truckie? What are you going to do? That is what I thought Senator Xenophon’s question was.

                                    Thank you on behalf of Senator Xenophon! You are probably just misunderstanding how the process works. My understanding is that you do not pay any more at the bowser. The bowser price is the bowser price. You actually claim it when you do your

                                    , whether it is on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. It is about the rebate that you get back. I think that probably mitigates on two fronts: firstly, I thought Senator Xenophon was answering his own question, to be honest, when he said that the Senate can get its act together fairly quickly; and, secondly, because of the way the BAS system works, the combination of the Senate getting its act together and the BAS rebate actually mitigates that fairly substantially, I would have thought.

                                       I will just try to bring a bit of clarity here. You could get the situation that the government of the day lowers the rebate, effectively increasing what I call a tax but what you would call a charge, but I do not want to go there. The price immediately goes up through the rebate going down. Some days, weeks or months later—it could be months—it is disallowed in this chamber. All of a sudden, there is this money that has been collected unfairly because the parliament has not actually agreed to it. You are saying it is not going to be refunded—that it must go into a generous Christmas fund somewhere. This is the problem that I think the opposition is trying to address here. We are not trying to muck around. We are trying to work out what actually happens. Whose fund does it go into?

                                        The government’s intention is to try to align the tax situation with the introduction, so there are three steps to minimise the impact. But a disallowable instrument works on the basis that it is legal. That is the way the parliament works. As I described before, one company chose to use the new accounting standard while I had a notice of motion on about disallowing it, and the court upheld that the process undertaken by the company was completely legal and the accounts did not have to be restated. The company were making a fairly major amount of money for themselves along that process. The alignment of the rebate process and the timing of it will see this potential danger become fairly minimal, in the government’s view. I am not suggesting for a moment that it will be zero. I am not trying to mislead any senator. I am not suggesting it will be a zero issue, but we believe that, with all these other measures, the likelihood of it happening will be minimal.

                                           is going to do with all the requested amendments, but he will no doubt tell us so that we do not have to have a division. I will just have one more go at request (4). I am repeating myself, but I just want to make this absolutely clear to Senator Xenophon. The tax is going up to 21c today and we are unhappy about that. We are unhappy about any additional charges on the road transport industry. But we have conceded it because the government have said, ‘We’re going to spend $70 million on it.’ You would not be surprised if I said that we do not always treat everything the government promise to do as accurate. I could give you about 10 examples of that in 10 seconds if it were relevant. We do not always accept that everything they promise is true.

                                          <p>
                                           This does not apply today. It applies in four years time. We are just saying to them that the minister cannot issue a determination: ‘Do not even think about it; do not bother about it unless you can demonstrate that you have these 50 additional rest areas a year.’ If we put that in the bill, it will make sure that it happens. The government will know that, if they ever want to get more money out of the trucking industry through the fuel excise, they will have to have done this. It will not come to a vote in the Senate. It will not be an issue. The minister will just know that they should not even try it unless they can demonstrate through some independent authority that the additional rest areas have been provided. I suspect it will be done through

                                           . I would not go for the state road transport authority, Senator Conroy. That is like Caesar appealing to Caesar. That is why I think they are good amendments. They will just keep the government to their word. If the government are going to do it, why would they possibly object? We just want to make sure that we are keeping the Bs honest, and this is an easy way of doing it.

                                            I will sum up a little bit.

                                            will support request (1), which is to make sure that there are not any formulas going with the indexation. We will support request (2), which says that there should not be more than one increase in the financial year. Regarding request (3), I have listened to both arguments. I am a bit nervous about the idea that it can be disallowed. You might come back and say that it is tough to give it back. I think I will support request (3).

                                            I am still not sure about request (4). This is about safety. That is the core of it for me. Rest areas are something that I think most Victorians and Australians would be fairly concerned about. Were you saying that the $70 million is not tied to the transport charge? I thought it was linked to this bill. I am a little bit uncertain there. The $70 million covers 14 big truck stops or 140 small ones or somewhere in that range. I think quite a number still need to be done across Australia, so the funding certainly needs to be increased. I am worried that having no set increase in truck stops is a real concern. The situation is basically: ‘Trust me. There’ll be more coming.’ At the other extreme is the opposition putting in a little too much detail. I am probably erring on the side of saying that I would rather have more road stops than not.

                                             I assure Senator Macdonald that I maintain my position. I am concerned that the requested amendments are simply too prescriptive. I admire the intent, but I believe they are simply too prescriptive. I will not go through all the matters that have been raised previously. But, for example, what does ‘substantial harmonisation’ mean? Request (2)(c), for instance, says:
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="italic">
                                             (c) the type of rest areas constructed, their spacing and amenities are consistent with the goal …
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             That is too prescriptive. That is my concern. My favourite phrase for the day is: let’s cut to the chase. The fact is that what is going to happen here is that we are going to see a substantial increase in expenditure for truck stops in this country as a result, in part, of this road user charge. That has to be a good thing. I commend

                                                   On the last question you have raised, Mr Chairman, I wish to indicate to the committee that, in relation to the questions of the bill standing as printed and the report of the committee being adopted, my instructions are that the opposition will be voting in the negative. We will not, however, be calling a division, which is why I am indicating to the Senate that the coalition is taking this view. I am particularly grateful that at least two of the four amendments have been agreed to, and I hope that the government will accept them in the other place.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   The coalition’s position is that we really did not want to have any increase in this road tax charge. We think the trucking industry already suffers heavy imposts. They do not get much for the road charges they pay. The roads around Australia are in a shocking condition, and the rest stops are not there. Regarding the question of harmonisation, we have heard time and again in this chamber about the stupidity of differences in regulations when driving from one state to the other. It has been agreed that they will be harmonised, but the question is when. For all these reasons, the coalition believes it should support the trucking industry and there should not be an increase without the guarantees that we have sought here. It is for this reason that my instructions are that the opposition will be voting against the whole bill. I wanted to put that on the record but, because of the inevitable time delay that would be involved, I will not be calling a division.
