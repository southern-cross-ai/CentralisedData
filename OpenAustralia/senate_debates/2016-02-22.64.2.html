         I thank Senator Fawcett very much for his question and particularly acknowledge his longstanding interest in defence issues and, in this instance, particularly in our humanitarian assistance and disaster relief work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our thoughts are with the people of Fiji following the devastating impact of Tropical Cyclone Winston over the weekend, which has caused severe damage in the Pacific. This cyclone is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded to make landfall in Fiji, with reports of widespread destruction and devastation and, tragically, the death of 17 people. I want to acknowledge the government of Fiji for their work in putting in place a number of precautionary measures to protect their citizens and endeavour to limit the damage. Early assessments indicate that those measures have helped to reduce the loss of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am pleased to say that Defence is working quickly with other Australian government agencies to ensure a coordinated response to this natural disaster. We are also working with our friends in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         in the response process. I can confirm that Australia will provide
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRH" rel="nofollow">

           , which is consulting with its broader membership about how they are able to assist in Fiji as it, as a country, identifies the areas in which particular assistance is needed. We have also engaged with other international partners, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, and are keeping them informed of our contributions to enable them to consider areas in which they may assist. Australia is also working in close cooperation with France through our France-Australia-New Zealand trilateral disaster relief arrangement here in the Pacific.

             I thank Senator Fawcett. That is an important question, given that the full impact of the cyclone is not yet clear, because power and communications remain down right across the country, and that makes challenging the identification of particular areas of need. As the situation becomes clearer the ADF stands ready to provide further assistance to support Fiji's relief and recovery efforts, as they may request.
            </p>
            <p>
             Australia does have some additional capabilities that may be of assistance. One of those in particular would be
