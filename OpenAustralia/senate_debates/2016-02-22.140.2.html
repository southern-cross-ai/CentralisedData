       <p class="italic">
        Under the
        <i>
         Dairy Produce Act 1986
        </i>
        and regulations, a dairy levy poll must be held every five years at a cost to levy payers of up to $1 million. This is irrespective of whether a change in levy rate is sought.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill proposes to remove the legislative requirement that a dairy levy poll must be held every five years and rather, that a levy rate will be considered every five years and a poll held only if a change in levy rate is sought.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendment will reduce regulatory burden on Dairy Australia and dairy levy payers and reduce the cost associated with conducting a dairy poll every five years.

       <p class="italic">
        The next dairy levy poll is due to be held before April 2017. Levy polls are organised by Dairy Australia up to a year in advance. Dairy Australia and levy payers have expressed concern about the cost of conducting a poll and a majority of dairy farmer levy payers participating in a voluntary poll have voted to remove the requirement to hold a dairy poll every five years. If the bill is not passed during the 2016

        sittings, it may result in the next scheduled poll having to be held in 2017. This would be an unreasonable and unnecessary additional cost to impose on Dairy Australia over such a short timeframe given that a poll was recently held to vote on the amendment.

         Narcotic Drugs Act 1967
        </i>
        (the ND Act) to facilitate access to cannabis products in compliance with Australia's international obligations. The bill will establish a Commonwealth licensing scheme that will facilitate access to regulated products derived from cannabis in a way that is secure and consistent with Australia's international convention obligations. The bill also updates and modernises existing manufacturing provisions to ensure that they are consistent with the controls applied to the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purposes and to manage the additional risk of diversion that cannabis products represent.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        currently has laws to regulate the import, export and manufacture of cannabinoids and cannabis raw material, but these do not allow the cultivation in Australia of cannabis plants for medicinal purposes. This was not anticipated at the time the ND Act was originally put in place. Further, the manufacturing provisions of the ND Act have not been updated for 49 years and are not consistent with contemporary best practice regulation. While they would allow for the manufacture of cannabinoids, they would not adequately control the risks of diversion associated with cannabis products.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As global supplies of cannabis for medicinal purposes are relatively scarce and expensive, it is anticipated that Australian cultivated cannabis will be sought for use in producing therapeutic products for research and other access schemes. Presently, the Commonwealth is unable to issue licences for the production of locally cultivated cannabis for medical use consistent with the obligations in the United Nations' Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961(the Single Convention) or the ND Act. Should cultivation of cannabis for medicinal use occur in Australia in a regulatory setting, which does not comply with Australia's obligations as a signatory to the Single Convention, then the Commonwealth would find itself in breach of its international obligations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill makes good the Government's commitment to put in place a regulatory scheme that addresses the issues dealt with by the Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill 2014, and covers the matters that are properly the responsibility of the Commonwealth. The Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended that the Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill 2014 be passed, subject to some amendment. This bill takes account of the recommendations of the Committee. It is important to proceed with this bill now to ensure that the Government is seen to be working in accordance with the wishes of the Parliament.

        Purpose of the Bill

       <p class="italic">
        To implement the parliamentary injury compensation scheme (including work health and safety support and equipment), authorise the Minister to determine scheme benefits in a legislative instrument, and confer authority on Comcare to administer the scheme.

       <p class="italic">
        Parliamentarians occupy one of the few remaining professions in Australia that has no coverage for work-related injuries. The parliamentary injury compensation scheme will provide cover for parliamentarians injured in the performance of their duties as a parliamentarian. The scheme was originally intended to be implemented by regulation and coverage was to commence on 1 January 2016. However, implementing the scheme principally through primary legislation instead, will overcome many of the practical difficulties with implementing solely through regulations.
