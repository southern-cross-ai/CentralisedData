         I thank Senator Bernardi for a question in relation to industry policy. I might have a little more to say about that over the next three or four minutes. The government is committed to delivering a strong and stable economy to provide jobs of the future for all Australians. Part of our strategy is to assist Australian industry to transition to the future needs of the domestic economy and the changing nature of the international economy. Our nation, which rode on the sheep's back for so long, is now in transition. Our manufacturing and commodity based economy is adding to it the highly technical skilled jobs of the future, which both are high value and rely on research innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last year, the Prime Minister and the minister for industry announced a $400 million Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda. This was to take advantage of the transition that is taking place. It is to build on our strengths, improve productivity, reward entrepreneurship and back business to grow. Cochlear, one of those companies that has been actively involved in this, has said this—Mr Chris Roberts said that this agenda demonstrates the importance of linking science with industry and that it is 'a win for jobs, exports and education, and a major step forward on the path to a smart Australia'.
        </p>
        <p>
         I said before that I welcome a question on industry policy from Senator Bernardi. It will be staggering to the chamber to know that, the last time I got a question from the shadow minister for industry, it was minus four overnight, we had not had speeches from Senators Leyonhjelm, Day or Muir—they had not given their first speeches—the

         s were still a happy litter and, indeed, Senator Lambie had not told us what she was looking for in a man.

          <p>
           I again thank Senator Bernardi for his question and his long interest in industry policy. As our economy transitions, this government will assist communities to adapt to changing industrial and economic circumstances. This is particularly important in locations such as Adelaide and Geelong, where the withdrawal of the automotive industry has been pronounced. The $188.5 million industry growth centres initiative is an important piece of this agenda. It will provide strategic investment sectors that have a competitive advantage with targeted investment for the best economic return. The centres will be established to support the following: fruit and agribusiness; mining equipment, technology and services; medical technologies and pharmaceuticals; advanced manufacturing; and, finally, oil, gas and energy resources. This will improve collaboration between business, scientists and researchers.

               Once you ask a question you will get an answer, my friend. It is this side that asks questions. You have not asked a question since 9 July. We have the $155 million growth fund and $50 million manufacturing transition program. They will help focus the government's approach. Our approach is strategic and is focused. It stands in stark contrast to that of those opposite. Those in Geelong and Adelaide need to know they have a government standing beside them during this transition process. They had nothing from the former government. They had nothing from the former minister. The

               trotted through three industry ministers in six years, and Senator Carr was a failure on every single occasion.
