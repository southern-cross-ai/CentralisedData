           The government will not be supporting this motion. The government is, however, highly supportive of the role of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
            TAFE
           </a>
           within the vocational education and training sector. As background, in 2012 the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments agreed to a new national partnership agreement on schools reform, to transform the national training system. Under the national partnership, states and territories explicitly agreed to develop and implement strategies to enable public providers, including TAFE, to operate effectively in an environment of greater competition. This is one of the milestones which states and territories must achieve for payment under the national partnership. The minister has asked the department to consider issues facing the vocational education and training sector, including those raised during the previous inquiry into TAFE.
