         Thanks to Senator McEwen for the question. She is a senator representing the state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , which already is feeling the impact of climate change in the lower inflows into the Murray-Darling, particularly into the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River" rel="nofollow">
          Murray River
         </a>
         . Leaders and policymakers both here and internationally have had plenty of time to get their heads around the science of climate change and why it is we need to act. We have seen a new report this week from a group of eminent scientists reinforcing that climate change is accelerating beyond expectation and that emission reductions are needed urgently.
        </p>
        <p>
         I realise that many people opposite might claim that this is just another conspiracy. This particular report,
         <i>
          The Copenhagen diagnosis
         </i>
         , includes 26 researchers, most of whom are authors of published
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
          IPCC
         </a>
         reports, and it concludes that several critical elements of climate change are occurring at the high end or, regrettably, even beyond the expectations of a few years ago. Key conclusions include: every year this century has been among the top 10 warmest years since instrumental records began, despite solar irradiance being relatively weak over the past few years; global atmospheric temperatures have maintained a strong warming trend since the 1970s, which is consistent with expectations of greenhouse induced warming; key changes in the climate system, such as sea-level rise and the melting of ice sheets, are happening faster than projected by the IPCC fourth assessment report; and measurements that now demonstrate beyond doubt that both the Greenland and Antarctic icesheets are losing mass at an accelerating rate, with widespread evidence of increasing melting of glaciers and icecaps since the mid 1990s. So, while those opposite debate and delay—

           Increases in hot extremes and decreases in cold extremes have continued and are expected to amplify further. Anthropogenic climate change is expected to lead to further increases in precipitation extremes, both increases in heavy precipitation and in drought. New analyses of observational data confirm that the intensity of tropical cyclones has increased in the past three decades in line with tropical ocean temperatures.

           I want to remind the Senate that there are those in this place who claim that the scientists are part of an apparent conspiracy. Along with them, you would have to include—if this were the case—

               Both the opposition and government should be commended for working together constructively to reach this agreement on an issue as complex and far-reaching as Australia’s response to climate change.

              <p>
               He went on to say that the agreement will enable Australian businesses to plan for and make the required decisions about investments to transition Australia to a low-emissions economy. This is not the Labor government saying this; it is the head of the
