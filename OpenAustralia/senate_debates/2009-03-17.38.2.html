        My question is also to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Water, Senator Wong. I refer to the renewable energy company Envirogen, which saves approximately 1.6 million tonnes of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
         CO2
        </a>
        each year by generating energy from waste coalmine gas. Is the fact that Envirogen’s renewable energy business will be penalised by the emissions trading scheme either an unintended consequence of Labor’s flawed policy or a deliberate attempt by the Rudd Labor government to hamper a viable green sector industry?

        </small>
        <p>
         Perhaps Senator Mason is unaware of the government’s commitment to renewable energy, which is four times greater than ever was delivered under his government. We have a commitment to a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. The legislation on that is to come into the parliament this year and will be discussed at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         prior to that. That will deliver a fourfold increase in renewable energy from the levels that we currently see as a result of the Howard government’s failure to invest in this sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, we have a half billion dollar Renewable Energy Fund, which those opposite may recall the Prime Minister brought forward to the current financial year to enable renewable energy proponents to put in applications for that fund this year. That fund is within the portfolio of my colleague Mr Ferguson.
        </p>
        <p>
         So it is incorrect to suggest in any way that this government does not understand the importance of renewable energy and the renewable energy sector. In fact, I remind those opposite that under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         renewables are projected to expand by some 30 times. If those opposite believe that they are friends of the renewable energy sector, the saner minds on the opposition benches who are not so ideologically opposed to any action on climate change might actually suggest that ensuring we drive the investment in renewable energy is a good policy and a policy that should be supported by the opposition.

           I am not sure to what Senator Mason is referring. I believe he was referring to the issue of transitional arrangements under a

            New South Wales

               Order! Constant interjection is disorderly. If you want to debate the issue, there is a period at the end of question time, which I draw to the attention of all senators, when you can participate in the debate and argue the merits of the case.

                Again I make the point: if those opposite are serious about supporting renewable energy, we look forward to their support for the renewable energy target legislation. We look forward to them changing their policy so they actually support an increase in renewable energy. And we look forward to their support for a scheme that puts a price on carbon, which is one of the key ways in which you can drive investment and growth in renewables.

                 , I ask a further supplementary question. As evidenced by Envirogen, doesn’t the fact that businesses in the renewables sector will be seriously damaged by the emissions trading scheme prove that the proposed emissions trading scheme is fatally flawed?

                  The fact is that those in the renewables sector understand the importance of a scheme which places a price on carbon and which recognises the costs of climate change for the first time. It may have escaped those opposite, but I again say: what this scheme will do is drive investment in renewable energy. That is why that sector of the economy is projected to grow by 30 times. It is interesting—isn’t it?—that they want to be both green and brown, depending on what they think suits them. The reality is that you have to have a consistent policy position, and the only thing consistent about your policy position is that it is all about Mr Turnbull shoring up his job ahead of
