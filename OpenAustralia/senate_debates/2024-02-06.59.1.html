        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. From 1 July this year, the Albanese Labor government will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. I know that Australians in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia

        have had it tough for the last couple of years, with cost-of-living pressures persisting. Can the minister inform the Senate about how many more Australians will benefit from the Albanese Labor government's tax cuts?

         I thank Senator Grogan for the question. Yes, I am very pleased to confirm to the Senate that the Albanese Labor government is delivering a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer, commencing on 1 July. Labor's new tax cuts will make a real difference to 13.6 million Australians. Our tax cuts have been deliberately and carefully designed to provide bigger tax cuts for middle Australia, to help with those cost-of-living pressures while at the same time making the tax system fairer. We know that many Australians are under pressure right now and deserve a tax cut, including those living in Senator Grogan's home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , where 89 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've found a more responsible way to ensure more people get a bigger tax cut to help ease the pressure they're under. Under our plan, working Australians will keep more of the wages they earn, and we are proud to be delivering this significant economic reform which helps to increase labour supply in crucial industries, such as the care economy, which will need more workers in the future, with female labour supply expected to increase by around 0.4 per cent. Our tax cuts deliver a bigger benefit to more than 90 per cent of taxpayers in in-demand occupations such as teachers, nurses, aged-care and disability carers, and childcare workers. Importantly, building on the first budget surplus delivered in 15 years, our tax plan delivers more relief to more people in a way that is fiscally responsible and doesn't add to inflationary pressures. Treasury's advice makes it clear that our tax changes will not add to inflation pressures because they are broadly revenue neutral, and our changes also mean that every Australian taxpayer will receive a tax cut this year.

           Thank you, Senator Gallagher. That's very helpful. Eighty-nine per cent is significant for

           . It's clear that these tax cuts have been designed to offer greater relief for middle Australia, addressing cost-of-living pressures and ensuring a fairer tax system. Can the minister outline how the adjustments to tax rates and thresholds will deliver a bigger benefit for more Australians?

                 I thank Senator Grogan for the supplementary question. Our tax reform package has been carefully designed to improve the financial wellbeing of Australians, particularly those in low- and middle-income brackets. From 1 July, the adjustments to tax rates and tax thresholds will deliver broader and more support to Australian taxpayers. We're reducing the 19 per cent rate to 16 per cent for incomes between $18,200 and $45,000, and we're reducing the 32Â½ per cent rate to 30 per cent for incomes up to $135,000, amongst other changes. This provides taxpayers with broader cost-of-living relief than under arrangements previously in place, especially those on low and middle incomes, who are more vulnerable to cost pressures. Our plan is projected to benefit over 13.6 million taxpayers, ensuring that a vast majority, including those in critical sectorsâ€”such as those in your home state, Senator Grogan, in education and health careâ€”will see an increase in their take-home pay.
