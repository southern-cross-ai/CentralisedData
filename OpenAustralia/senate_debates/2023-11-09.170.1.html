        I rise to speak on the interim report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Select Committee
        </a>
        on Australia's Disaster Resilience. Since the select committee was established in November last year, we have had the privilege of hearing responses from recovery agencies, unions, peak bodies, charities, state and territory governments, local councils and disaster affected communities across Australia. I'd like to extend my thanks to our chair, Jacqui Lambie, to my fellow committee members and to all those who've shared evidence with us to date through 16 hearings and 145 submissions that we've received. Your contributions have delivered a great deal of insight and have been invaluable to the committee's considerations. I'd particularly like to acknowledge the members of disaster affected communities who have taken the time and effort to share their stories and personal reflections with us, despite the challenges they continue to face, and also the frontline responders and Defence personnel we've heard from, whose experience and expertise have been incredibly helpful to the committee and whom I also want to thank for their ongoing service to Australia and their dedication to our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the groups that gave evidence, among many that are very much worth noting, is the Young Change Agents, whom we heard from at a hearing in Ballina. When the select committee travelled to the

        in June, we had the privilege of meeting with Jali Tan Costello, a member of Young Change Agents from Lismore. Jali became involved in the Young Change Agents program following the major flooding in 2022, which devastated large areas of the community. Jali shared her stories as a student, some of which I'll now read. Jali said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Last year my community and school experienced a catastrophic disaster that saw devastation throughout the district. After three days of being trapped on our property due to a landslide, I was able to help my family clear out my grandparents' home. This was physically productive; however, I was left feeling frustrated and disconnected from helping my broader community. However, programs of Young Change Agents offered me important opportunities to reconnect, activate my resilience and find purpose in my learning. As a class, our opinion was valued. We instigated change and our impact was far-reaching.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, Jali's story demonstrates the critical importance of engaging our community, children and young people in disaster risk reduction and recovery, particularly in response to natural hazards, before they become more frequent and intense due to the impacts of climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inquiries such as the Senate inquiry play an important role, and there are a series of other inquiries presently being carried out by the Albanese government, but I also want to make sure that people are aware there are a number of other important steps we're taking as a government. When it comes to Australia's disaster preparedness, response and recovery, the Albanese government is not sitting on its hands. We've rolled out the Disaster Ready Fund, which is providing up to $200 million per year for natural disaster resilience and risk reduction initiatives, and advanced nearly $1.8 billion in disaster payments to the states so that councils across Australia are able to fast-track local repair works.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just today we announced more funding to help the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West" rel="nofollow">
         Central West
        </a>
        region of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        recover from last year's devastating floods and build resilience for the future. The Albanese and Minns governments have committed a total of $100 million in joint funding to the Central West, where we've prioritised the most impacted local government areas of Cabonne, Parkes, Forbes and Lachlan. That includes $60 million for the Central West Recovery and Resilience Package to repair and replace critical community assets and public infrastructure and to provide legal aid assistance, and $40 million to deliver a resilient housing program for the Central West, with details of the program to be agreed following consultation with the local communityâ€”which is terribly appropriate.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's important that these announcements are set in the context of other announcements we've made. These are important steps forward in making sure that we work together to continue to strengthen Australia's disaster preparedness, response and recovery. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
