        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib. Was the minister advised of any risk issues associated with insulation operators under the Home Insulation Program and, if so, when was he advised?

            I have said consistently I was present in meetings where risks in the Home Insulation Program were discussed. I have said that. But these meetings did not include electrocution or fire. I have said on numerous occasions that we talked about the issues of fraud and the steps that would be put in place by the government to deal with those issues. Minister Garrett and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, as the line agency responsible, put in place a compliance and audit scheme. We have talked about the audit scheme, we have talked about the letters that were sent to homeowners to ensure work had been undertaken and we have talked about the targeted auditing of the system to inspect work. These were some of the steps that Minister Garrett took from inception and also as the program progressed.

                   There were many compliance measures put in place, as I have said. I have been answering these questions for a week now. In response to risk assessments that the department of environment conducted in the design phase, an extensive compliance regime was developed initially including the Installer Provider Register and the terms and conditions of registration, including a requirement for installer insurance and minimum skill or training competencies, the program’s audit and compliance regime, the nationally accredited training package for insulation installers, the referencing of Australian Standards and the

                    , they ask the questions, but they do not want to hear the answers. They talk about compliance, but when you provide them with the compliance measures that were taken they try and scream over the top. These were the measures that were taken by the government.

                     , I ask a further supplementary question, where, hopefully, we will get some specific detail. Have audits under the Home Insulation Program begun yet? If so, how many audits have found roofs with no insulation where the records clearly show that there should be insulation?

                         I am very happy to take that on notice, but, again, can I let senators on the other side know that the audit scheme is outside my portfolio. It is not part of the stimulus measures. It is not part of the nation building and jobs package. Senator Boyce, I would be very happy to try and provide that information to you. I am sure Senator Wong will have that information if you want to re-ask your question.
