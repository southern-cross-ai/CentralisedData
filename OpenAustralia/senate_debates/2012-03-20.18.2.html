           I am gracious—something many on that side are not. This is true. I am very happy to take the question from the senator. Given his reference to those two interviews, he is obviously talking about revenue projections for the minerals resource rent tax. I am always interested that Senator Cormann is so anxious to know what a tax he will oppose will raise, given that he has already said no, and continues to say no, to everything, including the tax breaks for small business. The government has published the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
            MRRT
           </a>
           net estimates in the midyear review released last year, which was $10.6 billion over the forward estimates period to 2014-15. We also have factored into the budget bottom line not only this revenue but the expenditure for the sorts of policies that we have been talking about—the tax cuts for small business, the instant asset write-off, tax cuts for the broader economy, investment through the increase in the superannuation guarantee levy and so forth. Those things are factored into our budget bottom line and that shows a budget surplus in 2012-13. I have a recollection, Senator—and I will come back to you if I am wrong—that you yourself
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
            FOI
           </a>
           ed some working figures from Treasury. I am sure you would be more across that than anybody in the chamber because you FOIed it, if I am correct—if I am not, I apologise.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would refer you to comments by the former head of Treasury,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Henry" rel="nofollow">
            Ken Henry
           </a>
           , regarding 10-year forecasts. He indicated that there was doubt as to whether they were worth producing given that they were simply too unreliable. Dr Henry, of course, advised your government and Mr Costello.

            on 14 February 2011 when they made those claims and that those costings show a $60 billion drop in revenue over 10 years? Shouldn't a competent Treasurer and finance minister be aware of those costings, or was the denial that they exist another attempt to mislead the public?

             —because we are a more transparent government than they ever were—the senator had in fact obtained some Treasury costings? I also made the point that Dr Henry said he did not think 10-year forecasts were sensible for publication because they are too unreliable. I also made the point that, unlike those opposite, we have factored in things like—

                     , on a point of order: question time is a time for people to ask questions of ministers. Senator Brandis says that they are laying charges, and Senator Cormann wants to pull a stunt. I suggest to you that you only give them the call if they are prepared to ask a question in accordance with standing orders.

                       It is the case that the government does not generally publish 10-year projections for individual measures, just as Mr Costello never did for the

                       . But I will take the attempted point of order from Senator Cormann because I think what he wants to table in the chamber is what Treasury has put on their website. It is hardly secret information, because it was publicly released. But what we rely on is what we published in our budget.

                              , with respect, the question was fairly broad, and I would make this point: with $70 billion worth of savings that they have to find, four years of Medicare is what you would have to cut—and you are hiding it from the Australian people.

                                The government are acting to ensure that the Australian people get a fair share of our resources and we are acting to ensure we spread the benefits of the boom across Australia to all corners of this nation. Last night, we saw the Senate, in what was a historic vote, vote to support the minerals resource rent tax—a great Labor reform and a reform where we really saw what the values were of those opposite. Labor senators and the Greens on this side voted to ensure that Australians got a fair share of the benefits of our resources. Those opposite voted to increase the profits of wealthy miners. We on this side voted to ensure we could give tax breaks to small business. Those over there said no and voted against it. We on this side voted to ensure we could give a company tax cut with a head start for small business. Those over there voted no. We on this side voted to ensure we can fund more superannuation for working Aust­ralians and also better benefits for low-income Australians, particularly women. Those opposite, again, voted no.

                                All they can say, in the face of these sorts of reforms, is, 'No, no, no, no.' The only thing they say yes to is higher profits for already profitable miners. I look forward to the senators on that side going back to their electorates, going back to their constituencies, and telling every small business owner in their state: 'I am voting against a tax cut for you. I'm voting against a tax break for small business. I know I'm from the party of Howard and Menzies, but I am going to vote against a tax cut for small business.' That is the new Liberal Party—the Liberal Party turning its back on small—

                                    I will take that interjection, Senator Abetz. 'They always have,' he says, because all he is interested in doing is standing up for the interests of a fortunate few—standing up for higher profits for already profitable miners. What he is not interested in standing up for is things such as the $6,500 instant asset write-off for small businesses, something that all small businesses could be entitled to whether they are incorporated or not. This is a tax break for small business that those opposite are opposing.

                                    , we on this side are also committed to cutting the company tax rate and we have released a draft of the legislation to reduce the company tax rate to 29 per cent, which includes a head start for small business with a tax cut—

                                     , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister advise if the government remains committed to using cuts to the company tax rate to spread the benefits of the mining boom to all corners of the economy? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

                                      This government is committed to delivering tax cuts for small business and for the broader economy. We have been consistent about that. We have released legislation which reflects that commitment to help Australian businesses right across the economy—to help Australian businesses not in the mining boom fast lane that are struggling with challenges such as the higher dollar. A company tax rate cut is good policy. But I just say this: the contrast could not be clearer. Those opposite have moved on a number of occasions when it comes to company tax cuts. First, Mr Abbott said last year, when he told the

                                      that they would support company tax cuts, 'We support company tax cuts.' Subsequently, Mr Abbott has not only announced that coalition MPs will be whipped to vote against tax cuts but also refused to recommit to the 1.5 per cent business tax that he promised at the last election, so he has changed position yet again.
