        Easter is the holiest time on the Christian calendar. It's not just a time for us to reflect on the death and resurrection of Jesus, but it's also time for many of us to reflect on the meaning of this event in our own lives. We know that despite the struggles and suffering which are part of everyone's experience at various stages of life, there is always hope—a hope that's based on the teachings of Jesus rising from the dead.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all love tucking into hot cross buns and chocolates, and some of us big kids at heart might even pinch the occasional chocolate during an Easter egg hunt, as I will this coming weekend, but we wouldn't have the joy of Easter without that cross. The cross does teach us that we have an opportunity to give ourselves to others, just as did Jesus did to others as well.

        This is evident to my home state of Victoria where the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Appeal" rel="nofollow">
         Good Friday Appeal
        </a>
        has been raising funds for the

         Royal Children's Hospital
        </a>
        since 1931. The appeal is a sign of the great hope of Easter, with thousands of people volunteering their time—an incredible contribution demonstrating what the power of communities coming together really does mean. And it's all about supporting a wonderful cause.

        This week, as Catholics and many Christians across the world take part in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week" rel="nofollow">

        , let us hope for a fair and just world for all backgrounds and communities. Let the celebration of Easter bring peace, especially to those who are suffering physically and emotionally. I wish you and your families a happy Easter. Please drive safely on the roads. As we say in our family: 'Buona pasqua a tutti'—
