         I am delighted to advise colleagues that the Abbott and Baird governments have agreed on a plan to roll out the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         to western Sydney, from 1 July this year, a full year ahead of schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rollout in the Penrith, Hawkesbury, Lithgow and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
          Blue Mountains
         </a>
         areas will, as I say, commence from 1 July. It will cover metropolitan, urban and regional districts. Senator Payne in particular knows that western Sydney is an area of high need when it comes to early intervention services for children with disability. This plan will bring the NDIS to 2,000 children and young people with disabilities, aged nought to 17, in these areas.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Senator Conroy

          interjecting
         </a>
         â€”
        </p>
        <p>
         I hear Senator Conroy's delight at that. Initially, from 1 July, children with disability and their families will be able to access information linkages and capacity-building supports from the NDIS and then, from September, participants will be able to access funding for the individualised NDIS plans.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
          The Commonwealth

         and the returned Baird government will work with the NDIS agency to settle the finer details of the implementation, including establishing an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p>
         We will continue to work with the

          New South Wales

         government on a rollout schedule for the NDIS across the rest of the state, from 2016. Both the Abbott and the Baird governments are very committed to a better deal for people with disability. We are committed to increasing choice and control, and this plan will see young people with disability in a high-needs area, such as western Sydney, get the vital support that they need sooner. I should in particular acknowledge the advocacy of Fiona Scott,

           Early intervention services can have a huge impact on the lives of children with disability, not just in the present but also in the future. The services which will be in place can help kids with disability to improve, for instance, their learning outcomes and, down the track, their economic and social participation as an adult. That is why we, along with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           , have prioritised children needing early intervention services as part of this rollout plan because this is an opportunity to make a real difference not just for the lives of the kids now but also to their future.

             I can confirm to the Senate that there are further bilateral agreements, which are still underway at the moment, with each state and territory to determine how we will roll out the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
              NDIS
             </a>
             beyond the existing trial sites. We are absolutely committed 100 per cent to rolling out the NDIS in full. I should make the point that I have made before that one of the reasons why budget repair is so important is to make sure that we have the money to fully support those things that are the core business of governmentâ€”things like the NDISâ€”giving people who face extra challenges for reasons beyond their control the support that they need. The NDIS is one of the most significant ventures that the federal government has undertaken and, as I say, this really is the Abbott government getting down to what is the core business of the Commonwealth government.
