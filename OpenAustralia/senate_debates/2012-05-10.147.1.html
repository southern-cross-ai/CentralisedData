       <ul>

       <p class="italic">
        Together with:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        They represent the 3rd tranche of legislation that implements the government's reforms to Australia's anti-dumping system announced in June last year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These bills are cognate and are being brought before the House together.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They contain reforms designed to provide better access to the anti-dumping system for Australian industry, and to ensure any applicable remedies are available as quickly as possible.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Substantive Measures
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This 3rd tranche of legislation includes four substantive reforms to the Anti-Dumping regime.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. All facts available provision
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        First, this bill clarifies the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_and_Border_Protection" rel="nofollow">
         Customs and Border Protection
        </a>
        and the Minister's power to take 'all facts available' into account when:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        This reform ensures that our anti dumping system better reflects the World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. Expanding CEO/Minister powers — Continuation Inquiries
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Second, this bill removes the need for a separate review of anti-dumping measures and continuation inquiries to be run in close proximity to each other.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is achieved by enhancing the powers that the CEO and the Minister have to conduct a continuation inquiry to allow for similar results to those currently available in a review of measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through this amendment, Customs and Border Protection will be able to recalculate the level of the duties of an anti-dumping measure during a continuation inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This reform will streamline the process, meaning quicker outcomes for all interested parties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3. Removing Limitations – profit and normal value
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Third, this bill implements the recommendation of the International Trade Remedies Forum—to remove the current limitation to the inclusion of profit when calculating the 'normal value' of a good in its country of origin, in certain circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This amendment improves the effectiveness of the ' particular market situation ' provisions in the
        <i>
         Customs Act
        </i>
        by providing greater flexibility for Customs to more accurately determine the ' normal value ' of goods.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These first three reforms are delivered through this b ill .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4. Additional forms of interim dumping duty
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fourth reform is delivered by the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendments Bill (No. 1) 2012 which amends the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975..
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This allows for different forms of interim duty to be applied from those currently used.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The types of interim dumping duty which could be used will include an ad valorem duty, a fixed amount of duty, a combination duty, or a floor price mechanism.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The methods for working out these new forms of interim dumping duty will be outlined in regulations to be made in support of this amendment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Release of the two working group reports
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today I am also releasing two reports from the International Trade Remedies Forum (the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITRF" rel="nofollow">
         ITRF
        </a>
        ) that make important recommendations to improve the Anti-Dumping system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The International Trade Remedies Forum is made up of 21 members representing manufacturers, producers and importers, as well as industry associations, trade unions and relevant government agencies:

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The first report examines Australia's 'particular market situation' provisions. It was prepared by the Market Situation Working Group made up of representatives from:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The report makes 16 recommendations. The government will implement all of them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of the recommendations (3.4) is to remove the legislative limitations to determining profit when constructing the 'normal value' of a good.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This reform is made in this bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Other recommendations include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The government will implement these changes administratively – through changes to the relevant guidelines, manuals and other arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The second report was prepared by the Market Situation Working Group of the ITRF, made up of representatives from:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        It made 11 recommendations—and the government will also implement all of them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In accepting the recommendations in these two reports, the Government is demonstrating its commitment to reforming Australia's anti-dumping system through reforms which improve access and reduce the time and complexity associated with making and investigating anti-dumping applications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In doing this, we also reaffirm our commitment to ensuring Australia's anti-dumping system complies with our international trade obligations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Together, the bills in this tranche of reforms and the 22 recommendations from these reports will make a number of important reforms to our anti dumping system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Foreshadowing Tranche Four Reforms
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fourth and final tranche of legislation to implement the anti-dumping reforms announced last year is planned to be introduced in the next Parliamentary sittings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fourth tranche will contain reforms in three broad areas:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will amend the subsidies provisions of the
        <i>
         Customs Act
        </i>
        to ensure they better reflect the World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes will increase the clarity of these provisions by removing long-term interpretive issues that stakeholders have identified with these provisions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Second, it will establish an anti-circumvention framework in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The framework will prevent parties involved in importing goods into Australia which are subject to anti-dumping measures illegitimately circumventing Australia's anti-dumping system to avoid duties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Anti-circumvention schemes have already been implemented overseas in the United States, the European Union,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , Brazil and, most recently, in India.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The development of an overarching framework to address circumvention practices will send a strong warning to foreign businesses which intentionally seek to avoid measures imposed through our anti-dumping system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Third it will strengthen the provisions that deal will non-cooperation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I want to ensure Australia's anti-dumping system is effective in dealing with parties that do not cooperate with anti-dumping investigations. The next tranche of legislation will include further amendments to support the Minister's power to impose tougher dumping margins for parties that refuse to provide necessary information within a reasonable period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These reforms directly address the concerns of business, workers and unions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They will implement the reforms announced in last year—and provide for a clearer and fairer system.
