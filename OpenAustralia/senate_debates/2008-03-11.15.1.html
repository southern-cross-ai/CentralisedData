        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Evans. Will the minister guarantee the retention of the $500 pensioner lump sum bonus?

         I thank Senator Patterson for her question. I know that she has had a long interest in these issues. She may or may not have been in the chamber when I indicated in an answer to Senator Bernardi what the Prime Minister said, which was that there was ‘no way on God’s earth’ that he would leave carers and seniors in the lurch. As I said in relation to the bonus system, not only will carers and seniors not be worse off under the budget, we are also working on providing certainty of payments to carers and seniors in the longer term. That is, we are looking to make sure those sorts of things are built in. I have also indicated that, while I cannot announce details of the budget—people will have to wait for the budget—when seniors and carers compare their bonus payments this year with what they received last year they will be no worse off.

          It is a simple answer to a very simple question: will the minister guarantee the retention of the $500 pensioner lump sum bonus, whichever form it takes? Will you guarantee to maintain it? The answer is either yes or no.

           The answer is not yes or no; the answer is very clear, and I will read it again for Senator Patterson. We hope to have the upgraded utility payments operating from 20 March—a large increase in utility payments over those paid by the previous government. We hope to get the legislation through in this fortnight so that they can be paid quarterly, going up to $500 per annum. As I said to you very clearly, Senator Patterson, when carers and seniors compare their bonus payments this year—when they have a look at what they get in bonus payments this year—with what they received last year they will be no worse off.
