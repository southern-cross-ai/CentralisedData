         Thank you, Senator Minchin, for the question. The government will not be commenting on the detail of proposals or speculating on the outcomes of the request for proposals processed while the report is being considered. Let me be clear: those opposite have continued once again, as I indicated in the answer to the previous question, to play both sides of the street. On the one hand, Senator Minchin has wanted to claim that the process is a farce and the process has collapsed, yet, on the other, now he is demanding that we sign a contract apparently by March. We have indicated that that is our ambition. But to speculate further, as Senator Minchin has continued to do, would undermine negotiations that are commercial in nature and go to the heart of the probity and integrity of this process. Senator Minchin should know better, because when we received the report the evaluation had occurred at arm’s length. The government had not seen the contents of any proposal, nor had it received detailed briefings on any proposal from the panel of experts.

          , I rise on a point of order. It relates to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant in his answer. What the question went to very clearly was whether there would be a regulatory framework that would precede the signing of the

           : clearly Senator Conroy has been directly relevant to the question. He has been talking about national broadband and it is difficult amongst the hubbub from the opposition but perhaps they could listen more closely in respect of the response by Senator Conroy. He has been directly relevant to the question. His answer has been about the national broadband rollout. In this process the opposition should of course listen to the question and answer. The difficulty that is always faced here is when the question is framed in such a way that it presupposes an answer, whereas in this instance they should listen to the answer being given.

             . Those opposite seek to ask questions and then ignore the answers even when they are directly relevant to the questions. I have already stated that we are not going to comment on the ongoing discussions that are taking place, because they go to the heart of commercial matters. They go to the heart of the government’s negotiating position. So—this is for those opposite—the regulatory framework goes to the heart of these commercial issues. It goes to the heart of them.

                That is exactly right, I think it was just a question mark on the end. I have already answered that question,

                . I said our ambition was to sign by March and I was not going to be commenting, as Senator Minchin will realise if he reviews the tape, rather than just getting distracted by Senator Coonan’s point of order—Senator Minchin has just demonstrated it was a point of order that had nothing to do with the question that was asked. We have made it clear: asking us ongoing questions while the process is still afoot undermines and is deliberately intended to undermine the Commonwealth’s position, and we will not be answering questions while we are engaged in these sensitive commercial negotiations.
