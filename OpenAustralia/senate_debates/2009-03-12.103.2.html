        Earlier this evening, Senator Bob Brown asked that a ruling made by Senator Forshaw as Acting Deputy President be referred to me for adjudication. Senator Forshaw ruled that a motion moved by Senator Siewert ‘that the question be now put’ was not in order because Senator Siewert had already spoken in the debate. Standing order 199(3) provides:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A motion that the question be now put may not be moved by a senator, other than a minister, who has spoken in the debate or who has previously moved that motion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Standing order 199(3) is a parallel provision to standing order 201(6), which provides that a motion to adjourn debate may also not be moved by a senator, other than a minister, who has spoken in the debate or previously moved the motion. While in practice senators have been allowed to make a few explanatory remarks before moving the closure or the adjournment of debate, Senator Siewert’s substantive contribution to the second reading debate on the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2008 could not be regarded as a few explanatory remarks. It was therefore not open to her to move the closure. Senator Forshaw’s ruling is entirely correct.
