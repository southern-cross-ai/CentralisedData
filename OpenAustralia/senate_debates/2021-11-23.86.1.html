        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Lawyers are taking the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        to court on behalf of a young former recruit. They are alleging that, on 1 October 2020, the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        aircraftman was bound, gagged and strangled by fellow recruits. In a video that appears to be of the events, the recruit is sexually assaulted. Minister, this is torture; this seems to be becoming standard behaviour in the Defence Force. It's the torture of an Australian who signed up to serve his country. When did Minister Dutton become aware of these allegations?

         I thank Senator Lambie for her question, of which I have no notice. I am not aware of the matters to which Senator Lambie refers. If the matters to which Senator Lambie refers at the beginning of her question are matters of fact, and if they are correct as she has described them to the chamber, then, in any circumstances, they would be completely unacceptable actions in any context—not just the context in which Senator Lambie has raised it. However, Senator Lambie has gone on in her question to assert that these matters are—I think, and I stand to be corrected by the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         standard behaviour or routine, or some variation of those words. I absolutely reject that. These are not appropriate behaviours, they are not supported in any context in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         and they are not standard behaviour. I will follow these matters up, Senator Lambie, and come back to the chamber with further information.

           That would be wonderful. When the royal commission goes through, I'll come back to what you just said, because that is all going to come out. Defence investigated the recruit's complaints of abuse last year, and nothing happened. What kind of investigation was held here, at what rank was it held and who did the investigation? That's what I want to know.

            Given that I've already advised the chamber that I am not aware of these matters, I have no further information for Senator Lambie. I'll take those questions on notice and return to the chamber.

              Defence have been offered a chance to see the video and have declined to use it as part of evidence. They might be going back on that now. They say they are completely unaware of this ever having occurred, and, when given the chance to see it themselves, say no. There have been dozens of complaints about the toxic culture that has seeped into this one base. Why haven't Defence done anything about these allegations?
