        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Is it true that the government has presided over one of the fastest fiscal expansions in our history? Has the minister seen the research of Dr Ken Rogoff of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" rel="nofollow">
         Harvard University
        </a>
        which shows that Australia has increased its public debt at the third-fastest pace in the world, after Iceland and Ireland, since 2007, which, surprisingly enough, was when the Labor Party was elected to government?

         If the senator is asking, 'Did the global financial crisis happen?', the answer is yes. If the senator is asking, 'Did the government go into deficit so as to ensure that we could put stimulus into the economy to save jobs and prevent the country going into recession?', the answer is yes. If the senator is asking, 'Was this government responsible for ensuring that 200,000 Australians and their families were not put on the dole queues because we chose to put stimulus into the economy?', then the answer is yes. And, Senator Joyce, your party made the wrong call on that occasion and you are making the wrong call now. The senator cannot come in here and ask me questions about debt and deficit while his side—

           while his side is busy adding to the Mr Abbott debt truck with the Mr Abbott spendathon. If the senator really cared about the state of the federal budget, he would go into the coalition joint party room, ensure that those opposite stop putting forward spending measures and argue for the support of the savings measures in the government's budget, a budget that ensures—

                . I was asked about debt, and I would make this point: Australia's public finances are extraordinarily strong by international standards. Net debt for us in the next financial year peaks at 7.2 per cent of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
                 GDP
                </a>
                . Compare this to in excess of 85 per cent of GDP for the

                 US

                in the same year or in excess of 73 per cent of GDP for the United Kingdom in the same year. But what is more important is this: the opposition cannot vote against these measures and still have the rhetoric. They cannot have it both ways.

                  It is correct that there are strong reasons to return the budget to surplus, which is why we are engaging in the fastest fiscal consolidation since the 1960s—3.8 per cent over two years. That is, of course, if those on the other side accept the importance of fiscal responsibility and vote for the government's savings measures. I am not surprised you are interrupting, Senator Joyce.

                   , I rise on a point of order on relevance. Quite simply, does the minister agree with David Murray's statement or doesn't she?

                     I started the answer by saying there are strong reasons to bring the budget back to surplus. They have been spoken about by the government, by the Treasurer, by the Prime Minister and by me. That is why the budget has us on track to come back to surplus in 2012-13, the fastest fiscal consolidation since the 1960s. Senator Joyce does not like people pointing out the double standard of asking about this and then not voting for those savings measures and voting for more debt through more spending. He does not like people pointing that out.

                        The senator speaks about the promise of fiscal consolidation. I am sure I can give a commitment on behalf of the senators on this side that we will vote for that. We will vote for those measures in the budget that ensure that there is the fiscal consolidation that the senator speaks of. We will vote for the savings measures that make sure this country is back on track to return the budget to surplus. We will do that. I would invite the senator, if he does care about these issues—if he cares about debt and if he cares about returning to surplus—to stand up now and tell us that he will also vote for the government's savings measures. If he fails to do that, his silence will speak volumes.
