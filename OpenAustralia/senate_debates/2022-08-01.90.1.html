         I thank Senator Pratt for the question and the opportunity to update the Senate on this very dangerous third omicron wave that is prevalent through the Australian community. There are many Australians who are losing their lives every day. It's a very sobering reminder that we are still in the throes of this pandemic. Our clear message to Australians is: you're not fully protected against COVID unless you have had your third or fourth dose. To those people that are behind with their boosters or eligible for their fourth dose: please go out there and get vaccinated. It will offer you individual protection but also it will offer significant protection across the community, particularly for those that are vulnerable.
        </p>
        <p>
         We understand that this is a really tough time for many Australians who are fatigued after the past two years of this pandemic, but there are things we can all do to protect ourselves and help protect others. Firstly, go and get your third or fourth dose. If you're eligible for antivirals please get them; ask your doctor for them. If you can't socially distance, then wear a mask. If you're sick, stay at home. And also make sure that you stay up to date with the latest health advice. Australians know that the pandemic is not over and people should continue to act in accordance with the health advice.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have taken action to take the pressure off our hospitals and protect the health of Australians by extending the national partnership on COVID-19 for the public hospital system. We've extended that support to hospitals, we've expanded access to fourth doses, we've expanded access to antiviral medicines for eligible recipients and we're continuing to get information out to families in the community and also strengthen protections in aged care, where COVID-19 is still such a significant issue.

            I thank Senator Pratt for the supplementary. Since expanded eligibility has been made for the fourth dose the number of people getting a fourth dose each week has tripled, from around 180,000 a week to more than 500,000 per week. Over four million people have had a fourth dose, which is up almost 1Â½ million since we expanded the eligibility. More than 50,000 people got their third dose in the last week, but more than five million Australians have still not had theirs. Data shows that people are more likely to get severe illness, be admitted to

            </a>
            or die if they're not vaccinated or are overdue for a vaccination compared with those who have had their recommended vaccinations. For those aged 50 to 69, it's around 16 times more likely. Almost three-quarters of the Victorians who died this year after contracting COVID had not had their third dose.

               Thank you, Senator Pratt. The Labor government has now made COVID-19 vaccination rates of aged-care residents publicly available, to drive the uptake of vaccinations as part of the government's winter plan. We have 78.8 per cent of eligible residents in residential aged-care facilities having received a fourth dose, up from around 50 per cent on 9 June when Minister Wells and Minister Butler wrote to providers to ask them to improve that rate. From today the aggregated data for each residential aged-care home will be available in both a list and an interactive map, and this data will be updated weekly on the Department of Health and Aged Care website. The Labor government's winter plan to boost vaccination rates is already working. At the start of June, less than 50 per cent of residents had had a fourth COVID-19 dose, but vaccination rates have now increased to 78.8 per cent.
