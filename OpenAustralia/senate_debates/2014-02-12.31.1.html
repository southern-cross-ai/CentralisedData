        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health. I refer to the minister's answer in question time yesterday when she informed the Senate her chief of staff has 'no connection with the food industry'. I also refer to her additional answer in the Senate last night, when she informed the Senate that her chief of staff was the former chair of the food industry lobbyist Australian Public Affairs and 'because of that previous position, he has a shareholding in the company'. When and how did the minister realise that she had misled the Senate?
