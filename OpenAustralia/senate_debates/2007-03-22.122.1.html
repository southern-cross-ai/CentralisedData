As a member of the Australian Industry Group, this company had been informed of potential changes to ANZCERTA ROO through the Group’s newsletter in December 2004, but apparently chose not to comment during the Government’s industry consultations.

         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RVC" rel="nofollow">
         RVC
        </a>
        method of calculating ROO under the current ANZCERTA for tariff line 3402.20 before the Amending Agreement comes into force.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Act 2006 entered into force on 1 January 2007 and brought into effect a new CTC-based approach for the ANZCERTA ROO. This change was overwhelmingly supported by industry as it will simplify the rules for trans-Tasman duty free trade, reduce compliance costs for business, enhance transparency and efficiency in the administration of the ROO and contribute to increased trans-Tasman trade. It also brought ANZCERTA ROO into line with Australia’s more recent free trade agreements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government was approached by one company raising concerns regarding changes to ANZCERTA ROO tariff line 3402.20 only after consultations with industry and negotiations with New Zealand had been completed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of these concerns, the Government undertook further consultations with Australian industry associations and found that there was no consensus in favour of retaining the regional value content (RVC) method of calculating ROO for tariff line 3402.20.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government nevertheless raised this case repeatedly with New Zealand at Ministerial and other levels. The Hon Mark Vaile MP (then Minister for Trade) and the Hon Ian Macfarlane MP raised the issue with the Hon Phil Goff at the CER Ministerial Meeting on 20 September and requested that the RVC rule be retained exclusively for tariff line 3402.20. This request was reiterated to Mr Goff in a letter from Mr Vaile dated 26 September and by Mr Truss in person in the margins of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
         APEC
        </a>
        meeting in Hanoi on 14 November. Mr Goff replied consistently that New Zealand was not in a position to renegotiate at such a late stage a final agreement representing a finely-balanced package which both countries could accept.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to monitor the matter as a possible issue to be raised with New Zealand, as part of the formal review of ANZCERTA ROO which is due within three years.
