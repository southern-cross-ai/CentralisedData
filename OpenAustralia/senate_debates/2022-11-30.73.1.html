        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Gallagher. Contrary to the claims of Labor Senator Pratt this afternoon, clinical evidence shows that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones used to treat adolescence diagnosed with gender dysphoria cause negative long-term health outcomes such as reduced bone density and impaired fertility. Does the Albanese government support these treatments' being administered to young Australians?

         I thank Senator Hanson for the question. I didn't hear Senator Pratt's contribution earlier, but I know that she understands this issue and she has a level of knowledge on the subject that probably exceeds that of most people in this place. Even without knowing her comments, I have no problem in aligning myself with them. I would also say that the—

          On this issue, on which I have talked to Senator Pratt, and she has educated me, I take that unusual step. On the broader question you raised on gender dysphoria and the Albanese government's position on it, our position is that every child and every young person should have access to all of the necessary supports that they need to ensure they access appropriate health care, regardless of the reason for which they might be seeking that care. That is our position. That is a responsible, mature position.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a matter between young people, their families and the treating health professionals, whatever they might be—doctors, psychologists or other health professionals. That is the position that we would take. We also think that, every time issues around this are raised, people listen and they hear, and it affects them. So we also think that there should be a level of responsibility in this chamber to deal with these matters sensitively and carefully, because young people's wellbeing depends on it.

They have no say whatsoever. They are listening to children under 18 years of age. They have no say; they're children.

              <p>
               I'm not familiar with the article that Senator Hanson refers to, but I would go back to my original answer, which is that if young people and their families are seeking support and assistance for health care and health advice, through whatever means, and if there is an increase in that, that is not necessarily—in fact, that is not a bad thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               We want people to be accessing the services and care—health care, legal advice, mental health support, whatever they need—in order to get the services they want and need and should receive. These are really difficult and complex situations that young people are navigating, and they need access to the full range of support. If they are accessing those services, good on them. I hope their families are getting the right support as well and that they are able to receive the care that they need from a country that provides that kind of support for them.

                 (—) (): As responsible leaders, we all want the best evidence based outcomes for young Australians. Will the minister support the referral of these matters for inquiry so the Senate may investigate the causes of this increase in gender dysphoria and explore the long-term health impact of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatments on Australia's young people? Regardless of the fact of what Senator Pratt has said, it's about having an inquiry so all Australians can hear what's being said by parents, by children, by the medical profession as well, so it should be—

                  I understand that a motion will be moved later today, and our voting intention will be made clear when that question is put. I haven't specifically looked at the referral closely. It doesn't fall under my area of responsibility at this stage, but we will have a voting position that is clear on that. Again, I would say that these are not necessarily matters that the Senate is best placed to determine on access to healthcare services. I think the responsibility of the federal government is to make sure that the service system is there and that young people and their families are able to use them if they need to in a whole range of healthcare circumstances.
