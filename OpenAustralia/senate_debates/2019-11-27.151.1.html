        (iii) transvaginal mesh devices were not properly tested for safety before being allowed onto the Australian market, though Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the associated companies, were aware of the potential for serious complications and they aggressively promoted and marketed them as a cheap and a relatively risk-free way to boost profits,

           Since issues were first identified, the government has taken strong actions to improve the way mesh products are assessed, regulated and monitored, including strengthening premarket assessment by up-classifying all surgical mesh products from certain classes to another class, enhancing postmarket surveillance to make it easier to report adverse events to the TGA, introducing new Medicare Benefits Schedule items for the surgical repair of pelvic organ prolapse and the removal of mesh, introducing a range of resources to improve clinical practice, improving patient information by mandating that all device companies supply leaflets and cards with details of each device implanted, and launching the new TGA web hub as a central point for consumers and health professionals to find information on transvaginal mesh. The Australian government supports recommendation 13, but notes that its implementation is a matter for state and territory governments and the healthcare profession itself. The government has written to the states and territories to progress implementation and will table an update in the Senate shortly.
