             I thank Senator Coonan for that question. As is evidenced by simply picking up the newspapers today, you can make yourself aware of which projects are in danger because those opposite have decided to irresponsibly behave like economic vandals. There are actual businesses who have identified themselves as needing refinancing in the morning papers, Senator Coonan—through you,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

             . So let us be clear: the Rudd government have said from day one that we are not going to wait till after the train wreck; we are going to put in place a safety net. We are not prepared to gamble with the lives and futures of Australian families and workers while we sit on our hands and do nothing. Those opposite advocate the ‘sit on our hands’ policy approach. It is consistent with their entire approach since this irresponsible and politically expedient Leader of the Opposition took over, and that is reflected right across the front bench opposite: cynical, short-term politics at the expense of Australian families. You can get up tomorrow and explain to those families why their breadwinner is coming home without a job—because those opposite are only interested in their own jobs. The Leader of the Opposition particularly is only interested in one job. He is being stalked by the member for Higgins and 28 other members of the front—

                      The answer that was being provided in no way, shape or form dealt with the very specific question asking the minister to advise which foreign banks he understands will be withdrawing their existing Australian commercial property loans.

                         It is clear that Senator Conroy has been answering the question, advising the Senate about foreign banks which may be forced to withdraw from Australia. It is an important issue. You should listen to him because the actions of the Liberal Party in this area are disgraceful. In answering the question, it is appropriate to hold the Liberals to account in respect of what their position is on the matter while remaining directly relevant to the question.

                            , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the minister has been unable to name one foreign bank threatening to exit Australian commercial property loans and the total lack of transparency surrounding the need for a big, fat, taxpayer-funded fund to prop up commercial loans, what possible justification can there be for exposing hapless taxpayers to the risk of yet another $28 billion of debt to guarantee the operations of the Australian Business Investment Partnership?

                             The only hapless persons are those on the opposite side of this chamber because a disorderly deleveraging process could force many commercial property projects to sell their assets immediately at whatever price can be obtained—in other words, a fire sale. Such a fire sale could destabilise the entire commercial property sector and create a vicious cycle where falling prices trigger further fire sales. That is what those opposite are advocating. ‘What justification?’ Senator Coonan asks. I could draw on the

                                  , I ask a further supplementary question. Senator Conroy earlier mentioned jobs. As the government has now spent $80 billion of taxpayers’ money claiming to create or protect jobs when in fact Australians are losing jobs and unemployment has jumped to 5.2 per cent on the Labor government’s watch, why should Australians then be asked to believe that risking yet another $28 billion for Ruddbank will miraculously shore up 150,000 jobs, as claimed by Treasurer Swan?
