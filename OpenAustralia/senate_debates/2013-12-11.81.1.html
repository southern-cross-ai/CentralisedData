           will be aware that in the 2013 election the coalition went to the election with a very, very clear suite of policies. On 7 September the public of Australia cast their vote, and they cast their vote in favour of the coalition's policies. We committed to the Australian people that we, unlike the former government, would implement policies that would break the people smugglers' business model, which the other side had continually fuelled whilst it was in government.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those on the other side would know that they failed Australians in relation to border protection like no other government has ever done in history. This government was elected with a very clear mandate to implement Operation Sovereign Borders and I am pleased to advise the Senate that we have made a difference from day one. There has been an over 80 per cent reduction in the number of boats coming to this country since Operation Sovereign Borders commenced. In relation to the offshore—

             . In relation to offshore processing, the Abbott government is fully committed to offshore processing, unlike the former Labor government, which used the term but failed to do anything with it. In relation to the rapid transfer process, I can advise the Senate that this is happening and the majority of people are being transferred within 48 hours to Nauru or

             We have, of course, taken off the table the people smugglers' business model, which is the promise of a permanent protection visa. Our policy is very clear: no person that comes to Australia under the Abbott government will receive a permanent protection visa. This government has the right policies in the right hands—

                 It is a fact, and Australians know it, that any federal government has the sovereign right to control its borders. We on this side understand that. Those on that side failed to understand that whilst in government. The Australian people, in casting their vote at the federal election in September 2013, clearly cast a vote in favour of the coalition's policies. It is only by delivering on our strong border protection policies that we will stop the chaos, the tragedy and the bill, of in excess of $11 billion of taxpayers' money, that was irresponsibly racked up by those on the other side because they failed Australians when it comes to protecting Australia's borders. To relinquish control of your migration program to the people smugglers is one of the most fundamental mistakes a government can make.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister advise of the dangers to Australia of not pursuing a strong border protection regime?

                   The greatest danger presented by not pursuing strong border protection policies is that, like the former Rudd government, the former Gillard government and the former Rudd government, we will continue as a government to outsource our border protection policies to the people smugglers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This government is completely aware of the risks that people take when they attempt to make the dangerous journey to Australia. It has been confirmed that under the former government's policies over 1,000 people lost their lives while attempting to come to Australia by boat. This government is committed to stopping the boats, to stopping the people smugglers from peddling their promise of a permanent visa and encouraging vulnerable people to get on boats and risk their lives. This government has the right policies. They are in the right hands, and those policies are delivering results.

                    My question is also to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Projection. I refer to my question last week regarding the number of individuals currently in detention centres and the documents she tabled in response, dated 31 October 2013. Why is the minister so contemptuous of requests by the Senate that she is tabling documents that have been in the public arena for over a month rather than addressing the substance of the question that was actually asked in question time?

                            Order! Order on both sides! Senator Cash and Senator Wong, there is no point debating it across the chamber. Senator Moore has taken a point of order correctly. When there is silence on my left, I will proceed—and on my right. At this stage there is no point of order. The minister has one minute and 25 seconds left on the clock to address the question.

                             In relation to content, as I was saying, this government on assuming office determined that it would recommence publishing the statistics in relation to immigration detention, because the former government had made a decision not to publish them. The longest period of time being five continuous months in which the department did not put up on any website the statistics, I asked at estimates time and time again for them. What was the responses that I got? 'The department is currently not putting up the statistics.' So Senator Wong, when you stand up in this place and you accuse someone of being contemptuous, that is the pot calling the kettle black, quite frankly, based on your government's record in relation to the provision that the Australian public—
