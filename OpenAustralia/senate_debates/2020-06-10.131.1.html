         The speech read as followsâ€”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agricultural exports are an economic powerhouse for Australia and are expected to be worth around $43 billion in 2019-20.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are one of the top ten agricultural exporting countries in the world, exporting around two-thirds of our agricultural production each year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Strengthening the competitiveness and productivity of Australia's agriculture sector is a key commitment of this Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We want our agricultural industries to be able to capitalise on the opportunities that flow from growth in our region and globally, and we want to support the National Farmer's Federation goal to grow Australian agriculture to $100 billion by 2030.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To help us achieve this, we need to ensure we have appropriate regulatory settings to enable exports to grow and in turn to help drive productivity and increase returns at the farm gate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will facilitate agricultural exports for the emerging medicinal cannabis and hemp industries. It will remove unnecessary regulatory barriers and ensure legitimate exporters of narcotic goods are supported to access emerging export markets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will allow certification of legitimate exports of narcotic goods. It is critical that our trading partners continue to have confidence in the safety and integrity of Australian produce.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will enable the growth of export markets for hemp and medicinal cannabis industries. The Bill will support the initiatives of the Government to reduce red tape, bust congestion in regulation and enable agricultural industries to come out firing, after the threat of COVID-19 has passed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For Australian farmers, reliable access to overseas markets means increased profitability and certainty for further investment in their properties and people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the Australian economy, it means more jobs, more exports, and higher incomes in a competitive and profitable agricultural sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For Australians, it means stronger regional communities and a more prosperous and productive Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill is just one of the initiatives that the Government is progressing to modernise the systems that underpin our very valuable agricultural exports. This is a crucial step that removes unnecessary regulatory barriers and supports the Australian agricultural sector as it continues to grow.
       </p>
