        My question is to the Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts, Senator Coonan. I am sure the minister is aware of media reports alleging that the government is failing to prohibit the carriage and transmission of child pornography and child abuse material on the internet and via mail. What is the minister’s response to those reports? I ask her to inform the Senate what the government is doing to prohibit such activities. Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Patterson for raising this very important matter and for her strong concerns about protecting Australians from abhorrent material such as child abuse material and child pornography. This is a scourge that demands both a focused and a determined approach from every person in this chamber and a collaborative relationship between state and federal governments—and increasingly international law enforcement cooperation. The government has a consistent track record of regulation, legislation and education to combat child pornography.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over seven years ago the government introduced the online content scheme, which requires internet service providers and hosts to take down offensive and criminal material from their systems and provides significant penalties including criminal penalties for any failure to do so. Similarly, it was this government which made it an offence punishable by up to 15 years in jail to procure or groom a person under 16 years of age online for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government’s criminal code already prevents the transmission of child pornography and other abhorrent materials through the post by making it an offence for any person to use the postal service in an offensive way. Child pornography and child abuse material clearly fit within that general prohibition, which aims to cast a net as widely as possible to ensure the maximum reach of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a critical area of national concern that cannot rely on legislation alone; it must also involve the use of technology to beat paedophiles at their own game as well as educating about both the benefits, which are considerable, and the significant risks of the internet. The Protecting Australian Families Online initiative includes a national filter scheme, at a cost of $93.3 million over three years, to provide every Australian family with a free personal computer based filter or a free filtered service and funding to allow every public library in Australia to set up child-safe internet terminals. I am currently in the final stages of industry consultation on a package of new safeguards which will protect from inappropriate or harmful content on devices such as 3G mobile phones.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Patterson has asked me about alternative policies, and I am aware of media reports that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         , after dragging its feet and opposing the online content scheme, is now proposing, via Senator Ludwig this time, a private member’s bill relating to the carriage of child pornography or child abuse material in the mail. While I am prepared to consider all and any sensible proposals to address the menace of child pornography, this gesture will be seen for what it is. Simply replicating what the government is already effectively doing is an empty gesture designed to achieve nothing more than political grandstanding. In the meantime, the Australian public can be confident that this government will do whatever is necessary to maintain our tough stance on child pornography and in dealing with criminals who exploit young people, both here and overseas.
