        My question is to the Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister provide an update to the Senate on the Gillard government's investment and action to assist Queensland to rebuild after the 2010-11 flood and cyclone?

         I thank Senator Furner for his continued interest in repairing and rebuilding Queensland after those devastating floods. One hundred per cent of the state was declared a disaster area. All can remember the terrible loss suffered at Grantham, where devastating floods caused much devastation and loss of life. In
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Far North Queensland
         </a>
         , within a very short while of the floods, Cyclone Yasi struck, impacting Cardwell and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Beach" rel="nofollow">
          Mission Beach
         </a>
         along the Cassowary Coast.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Gillard government are spending close to $6 billion rebuilding Queensland. Most of the funds are for the reconstruction of essential public and community infrastructure such as roads. In fact, we took the unprecedented step to advance $4 million so Queensland could get on with the job of rebuilding the state. This meant that local councils could start the rebuild with their costs being able to be covered quickly, not waiting for reimbursements. It meant that councils like Brisbane, then headed by Mayor Campbell Newman, could get on with the job of rebuilding their communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reconstruction in Queensland is progressing. All 418 affected schools have been fully repaired and $47 million has been provided through personal hardship assistance. And there has been a range of work carried out through the help of both individuals and small businesses, who pitched in to do the clean-up work. State roads have been repaired—7,300 kilometres of damaged roads. But only 25 per cent have been fully reconstructed; a further 40 per cent need to be constructed. Much more work still needs to be done. When it comes to the work, former Premier Anna Bligh stepped up—

          , I ask a supplementary question. As a Queensland senator, I know many people were affected by the flooding and the cyclone, particularly Imogen and Alyssa in Townsville. Can the minister inform the Senate how important it is to have close cooperation with the Queensland government during the reconstruction phase and how important national partnership agreements are in delivering the best results for Queenslanders?

           I thank Senator Furner for his interest, and it seems from the interjections that those opposite appear less caring. When it comes to rebuilding a state, politics should not matter. In response to the disaster events of 2010-11, the Queensland government—

            Their interjections really highlight what I said, quite frankly. The Queensland government established the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, the QRA, and that was the right thing to do, to ensure that the work that could be coordinated across departments continued. The QRA was charged with reconnecting, rebuilding and improving Queensland communities and the economy after the natural disasters. It was work at all levels of government. The reconstruction of Queensland required a significant coordination between local councils, state government and the federal government.

                  I thank Senator Furner for raising this issue because, as a proud Queenslander, I can say that I was distressed to read this morning that the Newman government has plans to abolish the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. I would expect those opposite, including Senator Macdonald, to fight for the retention of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority while there is still $3.4 billion worth of reconstruction projects in the pipeline.
