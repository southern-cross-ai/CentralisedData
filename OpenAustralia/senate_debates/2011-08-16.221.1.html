         5 Heritage value changes over time—an item that may be assessed as having no heritage value at any given point in time could later be assessed as having major heritage value and significance. Different people will also hold different views about the relative importance of items and their priority for preservation. The challenges associated with determining heritage significance are identified in work done under the auspices of the Collection Council of Australia's
         <i>
          Significance
         </i>
         Methodology1 (Attachment A). The Significance Methodology is now widely used across the cultural heritage sector, and within DPS, and was refined over a ten-year period (originally released in 2001, and then substantially reviewed and re-released in 2009). The methodology provides a standard set of criteria for defining "the meaning and values of a cultural heritage item or collection". However, the authors also note that significance is "relative, contingent and dynamic".
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         6 There is a very broad framework of governance and policy and procedural documents that apply to this asset and heritage management role for DPS. These documents range from 'whole-of-government' instruments—such as legislation, regulations, Finance Minister's Orders and Department of Finance guidelines—through to specific DPS policies, procedures and guidelines. A number of these are outlined in more detail in the responses that follow.

        <p class="italic">
         7 This governance and policy framework is not static. The approach across the Commonwealth to accounting for and managing assets—including cultural heritage assets—has evolved over the past decade or so.

        <p class="italic">
         8 There are a number of control mechanisms in place to support this governance framework. DPS is audited annually by the

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit_Committee" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         9 DPS takes its asset management role very seriously, as well as its responsibility for upholding heritage values inherent in the building (and embodied in moveable objects within the building). The resource implications of managing and maintaining this extensive collection of assets are significant. Judgements will always have to be exercised about the relative priority of the range of tasks to be undertaken, as well as the relative value of the assets requiring our care and attention. This is particularly difficult in the context of an operating budget that is progressively diminishing in real terms and the expectations of the community about prudent financial management in the public sector. DPS must also strike a balance between the sometimes competing requirements of managing heritage issues and satisfying building occupants' requirements for a functional, efficient and safe workplace.

         (a) rotational art collection;

         13 Classification and listing of other items that might have heritage or historic value has been an iterative process, and, in many cases, DPS (and the previous Joint House Department) inherited responsibility for items that were not registered as assets, or items that were registered as assets but were very poorly described and controlled. Over a number of years, there has been significant work done to improve the quality and accuracy of asset registers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         14 Decisions about the retention or disposition of assets with some historic or heritage significance require an awareness of the resource implications and sustainability of retention of the material. In particular, classification of items as cultural heritage assets carries an obligation to store and preserve that material for indefinite periods in accordance with relevant standards. This incurs a significant cost for the Commonwealth. This issue is reflected in the Finance Minister's Orders [see para 10(f)–(g) above]. In the last decade or so, this point has also been reinforced by the ANAO in its 19983 (Attachment B) and 20054 (Attachment C) performance audits relating to safeguarding national collections. In particular, the 1998 audit report made the following note.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <i>
          The ANAO recommends that, in order to ensure the continuing quality of their collections, all institutions allocate a high priority to identifying items for possible disposal, except those items covered by legal deposit obligations or equivalent.

         16 Since 2006, DPS has made useful progress in managing cultural heritage items and other building related assets, including the following.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Systems and procedures have been progressively developed for management of the Parliament House Art Collection (including the Historic Memorials Collection and Official Gifts Collection, and art furniture). Many important items were either not previously listed as part of the collection, or their listing was incomplete or inaccurate. Artworks and gifts have been fully catalogued and described; independent formal valuations have been conducted; and policies and guidelines relating to their care and use developed and implemented. This has also led to better conservation and maintenance outcomes, and improved inventory control for these items.

         18 Nevertheless, we recognise the need for continual improvement and have taken the opportunity—following the May Budget Estimates hearings—to initiate a number of new measures including an internal audit investigation into the disposal of two billiard tables; a review of asset disposal policies; and a survey to identify and assess items with potential heritage values (beyond the Parliament House Art Collection). These activities will supplement work that DPS had already commenced to finalise a Heritage Management Framework for Parliament House.

         DPS has education and awareness programs aimed at developing an awareness of what desirable behaviours are and how to encourage a culture of respect, as well as an awareness of what negative and unacceptable workplace behaviours are (ie bullying and harassment) and the consequences of the inappropriate behaviour.

         (b) The PHAC De-accessioning policy (Attachment R) defines procedures for PHAC disposals. The PHAC is independently re-valued every four years (most recent valuations—in 2005 and 2009—were conducted by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVO" rel="nofollow">
          AVO

         ).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) The PHAC De-accessioning policy states that: "Where appropriate, the Presiding Officersmay require any person or organisation arranging the sale of the de-accessioned item to keep its provenance confidential."
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) The Art Services section of DPS maintains a collection management system (catalogue database), which records comprehensive details about the PHAC (including sub-collections such as the Historic Memorials Collection, Official Gifts Collection, commissioned Art Furniture, and archival materials designated for retention as part of the PHAC). Collection items are registered in the system by staff at the time of their acquisition (whether by purchase or gift) and updated as appropriate (for example, movement/location details are updated every time an item is moved). There are currently over 6000 records in the database; but not all 6000 records represent individual items. Some records represent 'parent' and 'child' components of items; and some items are listed for tracking and information management purposes, but are not assets that belong to DPS. Examples of these are the Tom Roberts painting, which is owned by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Collection" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Collection
         </a>
         ; and the Yirrkala Petitions, which are owned by the Department of the House of Representatives. The PHAC itself encompasses around 5000 artworks assets that are owned by DPS.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) A sample stocktake (equating to 10% of the Collection) is conducted each year by Art Services staff. The last 100% stocktake of the collection was conducted in 2005. The practice of undertaking annual 100% stocktakes of the PHAC has been discontinued, as it was very resource-intensive relative to the levels of risk, and had a major impact on normal service delivery.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         An additional factor considered in moving to a sample approach is that the PHAC has very high mobility/visibility (eg high volumes of movement of artworks such as after an election). This process serves as a substantial stocktake and it can be quickly noted if items are missing—or some 'missing' items can be found to have just been mislocated (see table below). The sample stocktake approach is consistent with findings by the ANAO in the 2004–05 Audit Report

          Safe and Accessible National Collections

          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         , which was cited by the ANAO (in the 2004–05 audit report) as representing best practice.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Stocktake results for the last five years are summarised in the table below.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (f) Details of items disposed of or de-accessioned from the PHAC since 2000 are summarised in the table below. Many of the de-accessioning actions listed date from between 2003 and 2005—this relates to the progressive introduction (between 2001 and 2004) of a comprehensive catalogue database of items in the PHAC, and implementation of more rigorous stocktake procedures. Consequently it was identified that a number of items had been 'registered' in the collection prior to (or in) 1988, but had either been missing for sometime, or had never been physically transferred to Parliament House (some were also listed in asset registers of other cultural agencies).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In addition to items listed in the table below, there are a number of items that are currently listed as 'pending' for de-accessioning by DPS Art Services. These items include:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i) a glass plate and a ceramic bowl that have been damaged beyond repair;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii) three items that were identified as missing in the 2002 and 2004 stocktakes (one craft item, one photograph, and one furniture item); and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (iii) a number of items that have been identified as highly suitable for transfer to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Australian_Democracy" rel="nofollow">
          Museum of Australian Democracy
         </a>
         at Old Parliament House. These items originate from Old Parliament House (and some are physically located there), and records suggest they were never intended for permanent transfer to the new Parliament House, but final decisions were held off until the ongoing status of Old Parliament House was resolved.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Items that are identified as 'pending' de-accessioning will be referred to the Presiding Officers for consideration in due course, in accordance with the PHAC de-accessioning policy.
