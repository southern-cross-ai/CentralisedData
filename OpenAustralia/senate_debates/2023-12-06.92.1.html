        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, Senator Farrell. After a decade of delay and dithering on housing, the Albanese government has committed to an ambitious housing reform agenda to boost the supply of housing and help get more Australians into a house. Can the minister provide an update to the Senate on what the Albanese government is undertaking to improve the affordability and accessibility of housing in Australia?

          Well, if you listen, I'll give you the answer. The $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will deliver 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes. The National Housing Infrastructure Facility was expanded with up to $575 million and a commitment for a further $1 billion for even more social rental homes. The $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator will deliver around 4,000 new social homes right across Australia. We've delivered the largest increase in Commonwealth rent assistance in over 30 years. National Cabinet has committed to a better deal for renters to harmonise and strengthen renters' rights across Australia. More than 86,000 people have been helped into homeownership since the election of the Albanese government through the Home Guarantee Scheme. We now have introduced legislation for our Help to Buy shared equity scheme. This life-changing legislation builds on programs like the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee and the expanded Home Guarantee Scheme, which are already helping tens of thousands of people into homeownership. At every opportunity, the Albanese government has added to its housing agenda, and it will keep delivering to ensure more Australians have a safe and affordable place to call home.

               Thank you, Minister, for that answer. It's encouraging to hear the Albanese government is showing national leadership and offering support to make sure that Australians have an affordable place to call home. Some people think it's funny, but I don't. Can the minister provide more information to the Senate about the Albanese government's significant investment in the Help to Buy scheme and how it will bring homeownership back into reach for more Australians?

                I thank Senator Urquhart for her first supplementary question, and, yes, I can answer that question. She knows that, for Australians trying to buy a home, Help to Buy will be life-changing. Help to Buy supports eligible homebuyers with just a two per cent deposit through an equity contribution, bringing homeownership back into reach for thousands of Australians, particularly renters. Disappointingly, we saw those opposite team up with the Greens to delay this life-changing legislation in this place, causing meaningful delays to renters wanting the stability and security of their own home. I can assure Senator Urquhart that, despite the efforts of the Greens, the Albanese government has helped 1,120 Tasmanians into homeownership. With Help to Buy, we will help even more.
