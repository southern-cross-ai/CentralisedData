        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the 75th report of the committee, entitled
        <i>
         Treaties tabled on 11 October 2005, 28 February and 28 March 2006

        Report 75 contains the findings and binding treaty action recommendations for the Committee’s review of seven treaty actions tabled in Parliament on 11 October 2005, 28 February and 28 March 2006. I will comment on all the treaties reviewed.

         The Convention

         The Committee

        is supportive of research in the area of marking, tagging and detecting plastic explosives, but remains concerned that this technology is not yet scientifically exact. The Committee also believes that the Convention will provide additional impetus for technological development and international technology sharing in marking and detecting plastic explosives. Further, acceding to this treaty will signify Australia’s continued commitment to combating the threat of global terrorism and serve to strengthen Australia’s reputation as an authority on counter terrorism initiatives in the Asia-
