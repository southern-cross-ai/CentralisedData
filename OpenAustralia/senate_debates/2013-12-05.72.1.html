         I thank Senator Ruston for that question. The biggest pressure on the budget is the bad and reckless approach to budget management by the Labor Party. They were bad enough over six chaotic, dysfunctional and reckless years in government, but they are even worse now in opposition. We saw that Labor was bad under the leadership of Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard. They are even worse under the leadership of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
          Bill Shorten
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         We inherited a budget in very bad shape, with a $30 billion deficit this year and deteriorating, $200 billion worth of government net debt and deteriorating, government gross debt heading for $400 billion and beyond. Who was one of the main culprits of the bad waste and mismanagement and reckless fiscal approach under the previous government? It was none other than Senator Wong. In Senator Wong's three short years as finance minister she presided over budget blow-outs of more than $107 billion. In fact, it is the $107 billion Wong black hole that we are dealing with today.
        </p>
        <p>
         But that is not enough. Labor was not only happy to leave the budget in a mess with a $30 billion budget black hole; Senator Wong banked savings. Labor took a $2.33 billion cut to higher education. She banked the savings but did not implement them. She did not do the hard yards by legislating them through the parliament. She banked savings from not proceeding with income tax cuts linked to the carbon tax but again she did not do the hard yards. Now Labor recklessly and irresponsibly is standing in the way as this government works to clean up the mess that Senator Wong and Bill Shorten left behind. Senator Wong, you should get out of our way. Mr Shorten should get out of our way. You should let us clean up your mess—

           As a direct result of the bad decisions made by Labor in government, our economy is growing more slowly than it otherwise would have. The Labor Party year after year added more and more burdens into our economy. They imposed the carbon tax which we were never going to get. They imposed the job-destroying mining tax. They imposed more than 21,000 new pieces of costly red and green tape. And they scrubbed the Australian Building and Construction Commission—

             As a direct result of the bad decisions made by the Labor Party over six years in government, our economy is growing more slowly than it otherwise would have. That is bad for the prosperity of people across Australia but it is also bad for the government because it means that we are raising less revenue as a result of the bad decisions by Labor.
