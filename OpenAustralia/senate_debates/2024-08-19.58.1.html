        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Gallagher. The current shortage of saline
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
         IV
        </a>
        fluids in Australia poses a very serious risk to the operations of our healthcare system. Last week, you confirmed the government had known about an impending shortage since May 2023. Overseas drug regulators including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDA" rel="nofollow">
         FDA
        </a>
        , the

         European Medicines Agency
        </a>
        and New Zealand's Pharmac have confirmed that they have minimal to no issues with their national supplies. Minister, now that it has become apparent that this shortage has resulted from your government's lack of action, will you correct the record and admit that this is not, as the health minister has falsely claimed, a global shortage and finally take responsibility for a crisis of your own making?

         I thank Senator Ruston for the question. I know you'd like to blame everything that happens around the world on the Albanese government, but I think it is a bit of a stretch to say that the shortage of

           These matters are managed, and they're managed very effectively in the health system, as they are across a wide range of medications should there be a shortage. There are well-established mechanisms to manage these shortages, and the health minister met with his colleagues on Friday. They released a joint statement on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
            IV
           </a>
           fluid shortages, including the steps being taken to address supply in Australia by the national IV fluid response group as well as reassurance to the Australian public that health services are continuing. I know the TGA, as I said last week, is also managing a number of steps to ensure that we are doing everything we can to increase supply of fluids for use across our hospital and health system, and all of those steps are being done as well. Of all the systems there are, the health system manages shortage of supply of certain medications—in this case, IV fluids. They have well-established systems. They do so appropriately and so they can continue to operate the services that the Australian people expect.

             I'm not sure Australians in hospital would suggest that you've been managing this effectively. Minister, Australia has sovereign manufacturing capability of saline

             fluids and your government was given a significant warning of the impending shortage. Since the minister became aware of the issue last year, what discussions has he or have the Albanese government had with Australia's saline manufacturer, Baxter, to see how they could support them to expand their capacity?

             <p>
              I know that the health department has been engaging with all of the suppliers that exist in Australia, including Baxter, about how they can work to increase the supply, and they've been working with the TGA. It is expected that supply will continue to be constrained for a little while yet, but all jurisdictions report that they do have supply and that there is supply remaining while further resources are put into securing additional supply.
             </p>
             <p>
              Queensland and Victoria are currently the most affected, with other states having more supply than those. South Australia's position is improving now they have access to overseas supply through some of the arrangements that the health department has put in place. So everybody is working together to ensure continuity of the health system and to maximise the opportunities to alleviate supply. I'll come back if there is anything further I can give the shadow minister on Baxter.

                At the height of the COVID pandemic, Australia faced a global supply crisis of key medical equipment with barely any warning at all. Instead of deflecting to the states, the coalition government used the National Medical Stockpile to guarantee our supplies and provide them to state jurisdictions. Minister, why has the Albanese government refused to show similar leadership on the national shortage of saline
