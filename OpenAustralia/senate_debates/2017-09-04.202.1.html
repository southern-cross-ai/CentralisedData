           One thing that's really come out in this debate is that the government are making out that they're looking after vulnerable workers, but that argument has fallen over time and time again. If they were really sincere, this is where they would support these amendments, because these amendments are a simple package dealing with how we can recover the unpaid amounts for franchise employees. That's the essence, surely, of what this legislation is about. We're talking about vulnerable workers and we're talking about them being ripped off. Surely we should be doing something about it. This doesn't just put some airy-fairy measures in place; it gets to the heart of the issue—getting the money back to them. Considering the lateness of the hour and my voice, I will leave it at that, but I move these amendments and urge all senators to support them.

            The government opposes the Greens amendments outlined in item (1), which would extend the bill to cover related bodies corporate and remove the control test in proposed paragraph 557A(2)(b). This amendment would extend the coverage of franchisor obligations to also include related bodies corporate of the franchisor. This amendment would potentially capture all kinds of arrangements that have only a loose connection with a franchise business—for example, a subsidiary of a franchisor operating an entirely unrelated business. The proposed amendment fails to target those with a responsibility to identify and rectify underpayments. It ignores that businesses in the best position to address noncompliance with workplace laws are those with control and influence over the affairs of the underpaying entity. For that reason, the government opposes the amendment.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to the amendments outlined in items (2) and (3), which impose joint employer responsibilities on franchisors and franchisees—so in practice both would actually have the same employment obligations—this amendment would allow franchisee employees who are underpaid to demand that the franchisor rectify the underpayment. The amendments impose a presumption of guilt on franchisors and could simply incentivise struggling franchisees to underpay workers and pass the buck to the franchisor. This is obviously bad for workers, bad for business and bad for jobs. The government does not support imposing direct liability on franchisors for their franchisees' wages bill. Franchisors that take reasonable steps to prevent contraventions of workplace laws should not be subject to further regulation. On that basis, the government will also be opposing those particular amendments.

             just indicate that the opposition will not be opposing these amendments. Senator Rhiannon is clearly motivated by ensuring that the working class in this country are not ripped off. Senator Rhiannon's got a long history of being engaged in protecting workers whenever workers are under attack. I've been on many picket lines with Senator Rhiannon. I have been involved in many discussions and debates about workplace laws. I have been to anti

             campaigns with Senator Rhiannon. One thing I can say about Senator Rhiannon is that she stands up for the working class in this country and she understands the issues that affect working people far better than Senator Cash ever could.
            </p>
            <p>
             We think that this bill has just about been talked out. Senator Rhiannon is doing what she always does, and that is to attempt to ensure that workers are not exploited and to ensure that there are checks and balances in the system that will give fair and reasonable workplace laws. We are of the view that Senator Rhiannon is always genuine about workplace laws and always out there supporting the trade union movement and supporting workers far better than anyone else. As I said, I have known Senator Rhiannon for decades. She's been on more picket lines than even I can poke a stick at, and she's always genuine in her view. On the basis of that, we will not oppose these amendments.
