        My question is directed to Senator Coonan in her capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware of reported comments from former Chief of the Defence Force Peter Cosgrove that it is ‘pretty obvious’ that the ‘protracted war’ in Iraq is energising the global jihadist movement? Does the government agree with General Cosgrove that the war in Iraq has served to motivate terrorists across the globe? When will the government be making a full statement to parliament on the security situation in Iraq and whether there is now any prospect at all for peace or stability in that country?

         I thank Senator Faulkner for the question. I would say in response that the timetable for withdrawal and the conditions under which Australia would withdraw is not calendar based. Australians, as Senator Faulkner would be aware, have an important new role in supporting Iraqi security forces in two new provinces—
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Muthanna" rel="nofollow">
          Al Muthanna
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhi_Qar" rel="nofollow">
          Dhi Qar
         </a>
         . Indeed, we welcomed the transfer of security responsibility in Al Muthanna province on 13 July; it was the first province to which security had been transferred. This government is extremely proud of the role that Australia has played in Iraq in training and preparing the Iraqi army over the past year and we remain fully committed to security and stability in Iraq.
        </p>
        <p>
         Different people have expressed different views as to the potential effect of actions in relation to Iraq, but this government takes the view—and it is a very firm view—that there is still a job to be done in Iraq and to leave now would be to abandon the vast majority of the Iraqi people to both terrorists and insurgents. That is not an outcome that this government would welcome and it is certainly one that we will do everything to avoid. I think it is important to say that whilst a range of views has been expressed over the past few days—I do not particularly refer to the statement by General Cosgrove—certainly a lot of publicity has been given to the comments of the new United Kingdom Army Chief, General Sir Richard Dannett. I also understand in relation to Sir Richard’s comments that he has said he was taken out of context. So, without necessarily knowing what response General Cosgrove may have made to such comments as Sir Richard Dannett may have made and how they were to be regarded, it is certainly the case that it is very easy for people to put certain emphasis on comments that was not necessarily intended.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is extremely proud of what it has achieved in Iraq. We will not be leaving before the job is done; that has been made extremely clear. Whilst we certainly deeply regret civilian deaths—one is too many—we have to understand that there is a job there to be done and we will not shirk from doing it, Senator Faulkner.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, you have raised the issue of General Dannett in response to my question about General Cosgrove. Can you now confirm to the Senate that, in fact, General Dannett, who is the current British Army Chief, said last week that the United Kingdom should withdraw from Iraq some time soon because the presence of foreign troops is exacerbating security problems in Iraq? You have also said in answer to my question, Minister, that the withdrawal of troops is not calendar based. I ask you, Minister: can you assure the Senate, in fact, that all decisions about the future of Australian troops in Iraq will be made on the basis of the very best military advice and not on the basis of politics, which has been the overwhelming consideration to date?

           I thank Senator Faulkner for his supplementary question. In fact, I can say that Sir Richard subsequently clarified his comments on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" rel="nofollow">
            BBC
           </a>
           radio by saying, ‘They were taken largely out of context; we have a responsibility to see this thing through’—they are Sir Richard’s words. He also issued a statement saying:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The point that I’m trying to make is the mere fact that we are still in some places exacerbates violence from those who want to destabilise Iraqi democracy ... We will remain in southern Iraq until the job is done—we’re going to see this through.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Faulkner knows—because I have said so in response to his primary question—that this government takes its responsibilities seriously. We do think that in the circumstances we have an important role and we have a new role. We will not shirk our responsibilities and we will not be leaving until the job is done.
