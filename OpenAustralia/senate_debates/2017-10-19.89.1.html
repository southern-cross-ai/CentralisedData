        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. What criteria does the minister use to determine who announces individual grants under the Community Development Grants Program? On how many occasions have non-government senators been authorised to announce such grants on behalf of the government?

         I thank Senator Chisholm for that question. I don't make decisions on who announces government grants. Let me say that the Australian government, of course, provides funding and supports the development of important community infrastructure projects all around Australia. Community development grants are provided to projects based on their merit. The projects that Senator Chisholm is no doubt asking questions about are projects in Ipswich and Townsville, which are high-quality community projects that enjoy broad community and cross-party support. In fact, I believe that the local Labor member of parliament supports the Ipswich project in particular. The decision to allocate the funding was a decision of the federal Liberal-National coalition government, having received the relevant application. As is the case for many local community projects across Australia, a number of local and federal representatives made representations in support of these projects. Every individual senator, every individual member of parliament will look at opportunities to maximise political capital for themselves. I don't think that is anything that is partial to—

           You can laugh, but you were not asked about the advance to the finance minister. You were asked about the Community Development Grants Program and on how many occasions non-government senators have been authorised to announce such grants on behalf of the government.

             Mr Wilkie was very proud to announce a $4 million grant in his electorate of Denison which was funded by Senator Wong. No doubt it was the very effective representations of Senator Abetz that would have persuaded Senator Wong to provide that $4 million grant. It wouldn't have had anything to do with Mr Wilkie being a crossbencher in the House of Representatives in a minority government! We all can try and suggest that we don't receive representations from members right across the parliament.
            </p>
            <p>
             These two projects are high-quality projects. We support them and we're proud to be funding them.

                Firstly, I reject the premise of the question. I'm not responsible for announcement strategies by non-government senators. Whatever non-government senators decide to do is a matter for them. The government made a decision to allocate funding. The government communicated that to the applicants in the appropriate way, as is usually the case.

                Senator Chisholm asked, 'How much?' There are two projects, in Townsville and Ipswich. From memory, it was about $13.9 million between the two of them. Now,

                in Lyne received a total of $360 million in federal grants for projects under the Rudd and Gillard governments. I wonder: why did Mr Wilkie receive a total of $340 million in grants? I wonder: how much did Mr Windsor receive? Mr Windsor received $120 million to redevelop Tamworth Hospital—

                   The first piece of advice I would give to Senator Chisholm—through you,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                    Mr President
                   </a>
                   —is not to believe everything you read in the newspaper. The second thing I would say is that the winners of this are the communities of Ipswich and Townsville, which have benefited from a decision by the Liberal-National Party government.

                   -National Party government is very proud to support high-quality community infrastructure in communities right across Australia. Is the Labor Party saying it doesn't support the grants to the Ipswich project? Is that what you're saying, Senator Chisholm? Is Senator Chisholm saying that they're bad projects? If you think that, say so. If you think that they don't deserve that particular grant, I think you should say so.
