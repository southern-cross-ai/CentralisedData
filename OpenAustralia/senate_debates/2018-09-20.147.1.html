        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Yesterday, the Legal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Affairs_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Constitutional Affairs Committee
        </a>
        tabled its report, which found that Minister Dutton had a 'clear personal connection and existing relationship with the intended employer of the au pair in the Brisbane case.' What action will the Prime Minister take in response to Minister Dutton misleading the House of Representatives?

         Firstly, I reject the premise of the question. The Labor-Greens inquiry was nothing more than a cheap political stunt. The Labor Party, quite frankly, should be embarrassed. After all of this carry on, after spending weeks on end telling the world that this was going to be the end of Minister Dutton, well, Minister Dutton is alive and well. Your pursuit of Minister Dutton, you might as well have chased him with a wet lettuce leaf. Honestly, you should be embarrassed for relying on the fabricated evidence of the disgraced former

            That is not a point of order. Resume your seat, Senator Pratt. I asked senators at the beginning of question time when raising a point of order to at least commence it by addressing an issue of order or the standing orders, not simply to turn to a political statement.

             . Mr Dutton is, of course, a very effective minister, protecting our borders, keeping our nation secure. He has cancelled 3,763 visas of non-citizens who have committed crimes, including, 684 convicted for assault, 270 child sex offenders, 69 murderers, 193 for violent offences and 194 outlaw motorcycle gang members. The Minister for Home Affairs has cancelled more visas of non-citizen criminals in the last 12 months than Labor did in 12 years. You know what? I am being asked questions about interventions by Minister Dutton. Minister Dutton has used his intervention powers on 4,816 occasions in the nearly four years since December 2014. Do you know how many times Mr Bowen and the member for Gorton used their powers in just two financial years? 23,000 times. The Labor Party are completely hypocritical in relation to this. The Labor Party are the Olympic record holders when it comes to the use of—

                  In the last month it has been revealed that the minister's walking buddy Minister Dutton intervened within hours for two au pairs on tourist visas, misled the parliament, influenced cabinet decisions despite having a conflict of interest and may not even be qualified to be a member of parliament. Why is the Prime Minister continuing to support the Minister for Home Affairs?
