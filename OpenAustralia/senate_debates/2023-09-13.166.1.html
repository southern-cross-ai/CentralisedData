        by leave—Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend Senator Payne's valedictory this afternoon as I'll be travelling to the Pacific Island Forum Foreign Ministers Meeting. When I said this to Senator Payne, she said, 'I know how that feels.' But I did want to make some brief contributions before I left, to place on the record my respect for her contribution to this place over the past 26 years.

        is the longest-serving woman senator in Australian history. That's an extraordinary achievement, and it speaks to Senator Payne's determination and to her fortitude. I think all of us here know how hard it is to earn and retain preselection.

         That was said with some understatement, right? We all know that. We also know what it is to live under intense scrutiny, away from our loved ones, and the personal toll it can take. It speaks to Marise's courage and resilience that for so many years, particularly in the Howard government, she was prepared to stand her ground on issues she cared deeply about, regardless of whether that benefited, or did not, her personal career advancement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Payne, you will be rightly remembered for your commitment both to the Liberal Party and to liberalism, particularly at a time when many might have seen those positions as being in conflict. And in doing so, you demonstrated your commitment to your principles. I said in my public statement after Senator Payne indicated her resignation that I respected her love of country and her belief in our institutions, particularly the Senate. Along the way, Senator Payne has held senior cabinet roles: Human Services, Women and Defence—indeed, she was Australia's first woman defence minister—again, another historic achievement. And then of course she held foreign affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is special responsibility in this portfolio to put the country above any other interests. I think that those of us who have had the high and rare privilege of serving as Australia's foreign minister are acutely aware of that. The political environment clamours for binaries of black and white, but foreign affairs is a portfolio that requires an ability to chart a course through complexity and ambiguity. I would say that Senator Payne sought to do this—perhaps even when others took a different tack. This is to her great credit and to our country's benefit.
        </p>

         has sought to be a leader for women and girls, and to encourage as many women and girls as possible to get involved in politics.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that Senator Payne's retirement makes me the longest-serving female senator. I do not thank her for making me feel old, but I do thank her for her contribution. On behalf of the government, I congratulate Senator Marise Payne on her 26 years of dedicated service to the people of

          , Minister Wong, for her thoughtful and generous remarks today. I appreciate them very much. This is overwhelming a place of adversity, but when it is not, it is at its strongest. In coming into the chamber today you, like me before you, are making yet another trip in support of Australia's interests and those of our partners. I really do appreciate you making that statement, Senator Wong. Thank you very much.
