         I thank the senator for his interest in this government's efforts to meaningfully engage with our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          First Australians
         </a>
         . Never before have such political energies been focused on turning around the disadvantage in Aboriginal and Islander communities. We have a Prime Minister who is prepared to accept the accountability which goes with being called the Prime Minister for Aboriginal and Islander people. We hear the clutter from the other side. They and their Leader of the Opposition snipe from the sidelines whilst this government gets on with the job of engaging with our First Australians with real results.

         , the Prime Minister will work alongside Yolngu people to listen and take part in practical activities that will directly benefit the community and the Prime Minister's understanding of issues that face them. This is no empty gesture. This is a government that is rolling up its sleeves to work with and listen to Aboriginal and Islander Australians. They are doing it on their terms. The fact that this Prime Minister is prepared to do so is nothing short of extraordinary.

             This government has certainly made a significant commitment to the extent of tens of millions of dollars to lift school attendance rates in remote schools through the Remote School Attendance Strategy, and I am pleased to report that that strategy is taking effect. It has been rolled out in 73 schools in the

             . Early signs show a sustained upward trend, and this is delightful news for those communities. The average attendance rate is up by 5.1 per cent compared with term one in 2013 in the 40 communities participating in stage 1. Importantly, we are already getting an unprecedented level of data and cooperation through all the participating jurisdictions. I take this opportunity to congratulate everyone who is involved and supporting us in this important initiative.

               Sadly, there does not seem to be a completely bipartisan approach. Instead of congratulating the Prime Minister on his commitment to live and work amongst the Yolngu people, along with the groans from the other side the Leader of the Opposition has used this opportunity to attack the Prime Minister. As the Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, I make it my business to speak directly to Aboriginal and Islander people across this nation. I know it is important to talk to them on their country about their solutions. I know they want to be part of the solutions, and they are sick and tired of being seen as part of the challenge and as failures. The Leader of the Opposition might sit in comfort in his office in Canberra or in leafy

               in Melbourne, but from there he casts negativity on the Prime Minister's visit to North-east
