         The reason we're in the committee stage is the opposition rightly requested, and put forward a motion today, to rearrange the government's business to ensure this opportunity was given to us tonight. Had we not put forward that motion, we would currently be heading towards a guillotine of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law" rel="nofollow">
          Family Law
         </a>
         Amendment Bill 2023, one of the most important bills to come before the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Senate
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         We had a number of questions that were asked yesterday in relation to the objects of the bill. I will commence my time in committee by putting a few remarks on the record for the benefit of the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         and for the benefit of my Senate colleagues. As I said, unfortunately this is not the committee stage we would have liked. It is an incredibly complex bill. It has an impact on the lives—in fact, it's one of the few bills that actually has a personal impact on people because thousands upon thousands of Australians are confronted with separation each year, and some of them have the unfortunate reality of having to go through the family law system.
        </p>
        <p>
         When Australians look at this debate, as they may well one day, I would like them to know where the coalition stands on this bill. I have circulated, on behalf of the coalition, nine separate sets of amendments to the bill; I will be moving them tomorrow. But I would like to speak to them, and then interrogate the minister further in relation to the government's aspects of the bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first set of amendments, on sheet 2066, relates to the objects and principles of the parenting framework and the factors a court must consider in determining the best interest of the children. It restores the objects clause of the parenting framework. Quite frankly, based on the answers we received from the minister yesterday, I cannot see how anybody in their right mind looking at the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         record from yesterday could possibly object to this. When you ask questions like, 'How does a mum or dad who are going through the family law system, who are going through one of the most distressing periods in their life, get guidance?'—because Labor are taking the objects out and are merely referencing, by incorporation, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child" rel="nofollow">
          Convention on the Rights of the Child
         </a>
         —the answer from the minister is, 'It is online.' I would have thought, in the first instance, that it makes no sense to remove the objects. Secondly, given the contempt this government clearly has for mums and dads out there who quite frankly won't even know what the UN convention is, let alone that they've got to go to it to work out what the objects of the family law system are in determining their case in relation to access to their children—as we heard yesterday, when they actually get to the convention online there are 54 separate articles they need to then work through to actually work out which ones will then apply to their case. Our amendments will restore the objects clause of the parenting framework. They say that basic principles like 'parents should agree about the future parenting of their children' should appear on the face of the legislation. These are important signposts for unrepresented litigants and for separating couples who never get to a court at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         This set of amendments also restores sense to the factors that determine the best interests of the child. It would require the courts to consider the benefit of a meaningful relationship—as we heard yesterday, the Australian government, through the Attorney-General,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus" rel="nofollow">
          Mark Dreyfus
         </a>
         , has removed the word 'meaningful'; we will have that restored—with the child's parents where it is safe to do so. It fixes a drafting error which would potentially encourage parents to coach their children. That is the evidence that has been presented and one of the issues that now arises. It also addresses significant legal concerns that the current drafting risks excluding information that is highly relevant to parenting orders. These changes are not controversial. They have been recommended by pre-eminent academics in the field, like Professor Patrick Parkinson, and bodies like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Law Council of Australia
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The second set of amendments, on sheet 2067, which I have circulated on behalf of the coalition, adopts the ALRC's recommended drafting on the best way to address misunderstandings of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility. It accepts the evidence—as I said, the ALRC put this forward—that the presumption as currently drafted can often be confused with equal time. That is accepted. The coalition's amendments also accept the independent expert conclusion reached by the ALRC:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The ALRC supports the idea that a presumption of shared parental responsibility serves as a good starting point for negotiations between parents and recommends that the concept be retained.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Attorney-General was not interested in what the ALRC said in relation to that.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ALRC also said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … the wording of the presumption should be clarified to avoid the confusion surrounding the term 'equal shared parental responsibility' and the conflation with equal time.
        </p>
        <p>
         One might say this is practical, not ideological, but obviously not according to the Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus.
        </p>
        <p>
         The third set of amendments I have circulated, on sheet 2068, improves the drafting around the reconsideration of final parenting orders. It reflects the considered view of bodies like the Law Council of Australia by allowing the court to take account of the kind of matter that a parenting order deals with when determining whether to reconsider. Again, this is appropriate. The threshold should be higher for revisiting major issues, like a child's religion or the city they live in. For less significant issues, like variations to the amount of time a child spends with a person, it should be lower.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fourth set of amendments, on sheet 2069, invites the government to start over in its simplification of the enforcement regime for parenting orders. It omits schedule 2 of the bill. We agree that the regime needs to be simplified, but the profession has been unimpressed with the legislation that the government has put forward and the proposal that the government wants the Senate to agree with. This is what one bar association—quite seriously, this is about Attorney-General Dreyfus's legislation—said to the Attorney-General: 'It replaces one complex mess with a different complex mess.' Well, that is great! I thought the whole point of the reviews that have been undertaken was to actually simplify the family law system. One complex mess has merely been replaced by the Attorney-General of Australia with another complex mess.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fifth amendment, on sheet 2070, addresses the unintended consequences of the government's change to the definitions of 'relative' and 'member of the family' for Indigenous children. As drafted, the government's bill would significantly expand notification obligations, but only in relation to Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         families. What would then happen is that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Family Law Act
         </a>
         would become more onerous for that group than it is for any other Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sixth set of amendments, on sheet 2071, removes a provision that discourages any lawyer from taking on independent children's legal work. Why would you want to discourage lawyers from taking on this work? As drafted, the bill contains an implied threat that any lawyer doing such work could be subject to a hearing about their own conduct, adding an additional step in the litigation process and meaning additional time and costs for families.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will return to the balance of the amendments when I'm next able to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday, I was turning to the best-interests factors and a meaningful relationship with the child's parents. I'd again ask the minister to set the record. Do you agree it's in the best interests of a child to have a meaningful relationship with both parents where it is safe to do so?

           It would appear that we're going to be on the roundabout again of one particular answer being given all night. As we explore that answer, unfortunately, we do not seem to get any further down the path in terms of an explanation for the poor mums and dads who will be going through this process. Unfortunately, when we hit 8.30 it will all be over for this bill.
          </p>
          <p>
           The seventh amendment that I've moved on behalf of the coalition, on sheet 2702, adds an overarching objective to the practice and procedure provisions. As drafted, the objectives would allow an approach that is safe, quick and cheap—and entirely destructive of whatever is left of the family relationship. The amendment says that the court should also aim to minimise acrimony. I would have thought that that is exactly what you want to do. If you're in the Family Court system—let's be honest—it is a highly, highly contested situation. I would have thought that the amendment, providing that one of the court's aims should also be to minimise acrimony, is one that the government would be able accept. It also adopts a clear recommendation from the profession.
          </p>
          <p>
           The eighth amendment, on sheet 2073, opposes the entirety of schedule 8. The only purpose for that schedule—and you've got to love the Attorney-General, seriously—is to provide a trigger for the Attorney to demerge the family courts after the next election. I note that, in an article written a few weeks ago, regarding this part of the act and whether or not this was a path the government was going to go down, a spokesperson for the Attorney-General, or it may have been the Attorney-General himself, basically said that was a matter for the government. If you are not going to do it, (a) why would you put it in this bill and (b) why wouldn't you come out and say, 'No, that is not the intention of this schedule.' And yet what we know, from the limited committee inquiry, is that it is a purely political decision that came out of the Attorney-General's office. I am still unable to find any evidence that it was recommended. As I said, it's a political decision that came out of the Attorney-General's office.
          </p>
          <p>
           The ninth amendment, on sheet 2706, requires a review of this bill in its entirety. We have shown good faith here and required that the review be independent. Unfortunately, the Attorney was not prepared to match that commitment. Instead of acting in the best interests of families, he has set up an option to find a friendly reviewer that will recommend what he wants to hear so he can further pursue his ideological family law agenda—again to the detriment of those thousands of families who, unfortunately, are going to come into contact with this system.
          </p>
          <p>
           Without the amendments that we propose, the bill itself can only have a very sad ending for so many. These are sensible amendments. The amendments that we have put forward reflect the considered view of independent bodies and experts—including, as I said, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Law_Reform_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Law Reform Commission
           </a>
           —in particular, in relation to the total removal of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, another frolic of the Attorney-General. There's no evidence that the Attorney-General took into consideration the recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission. As I said, they are sensible amendments that take into account the considered views of independent bodies and independent experts. I would ask that, as senators are looking at these amendments, they—even the government—do so in the spirit of bipartisanship. All we want to do is improve the bill. We acknowledge that a deal has been done. Obviously the bill will go through, but I would just ask the government to reflect on our amendments and the fact that they have been put forward, as I said, in a genuine effort of bipartisanship and to actually make the bill better.

           Minister, in March, the Attorney-General published a piece in the

             Herald Sun

             Courier Mail
            </a>
           </i>
           in which he said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           For most children, it is overwhelmingly in their best interest to have a meaningful relationship with both parents after separation. The proposed amendments recognise this.
          </p>
          <p>
           But Professor Patrick Parkinson—and, on any analysis, he is a leading expert in the field and a key architect of the existing legislation—said in his submission that 'the new bill essentially removes from the act almost every single reference to the importance of both parents being involved in children's lives after separation'.
          </p>
          <p>
           In fact, directly contrary to the Attorney's claims, the government, in the legislation we have before us, has quite deliberately—it is a deliberate act—and expressly removed any requirement to consider a meaningful relationship at all. I go back to the Attorney-General's quote:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           For most children, it is overwhelmingly in their best interest to have a meaningful relationship with both parents after separation. The proposed amendments recognise this.
          </p>
          <p>
           They are actually the Attorney-General's words. You then have the evidence of one of the leading experts in the field who points to the bill itself and says that this is not reflected in the bill. The Attorney-General's claim that interest proposed amendments recognise that it is overwhelmingly in the best interests of children to have a meaningful relationship with both children is misleading, Minister.

            Thank you, Senator Cash. Unfortunately, I have not seen the article that you are referring to. I do try to follow the actions and media articles of the Attorney-General as best I can, but I have not seen that.

            But, in terms of the removal of the term 'meaningful', as I think we touched on briefly yesterday, the ALRC recommended the removal of the term 'meaningful' in the best interests factors. There is ambiguity about the meaning of this word, and the government's proposed drafting emphasises that the sort of relationship that will benefit the child is a question of fact to be determined in each case.

             Unfortunately, even the answer would appear to indicate that what the Attorney-General said in the published piece is inconsistent with the bill we actually have before us and the amendment moved by the opposition to add back in or to restore the word 'meaningful' was probably more of a reflection of the Attorney-General's quote.

             I will now turn to 'any views expressed by the child'. I want to take you to proposed section 60CC(2)(b). This is the provision that says that, in determining what is in the child's best interest, the court must consider 'any views expressed by the child'. If a parent maliciously coaches a child to say something hurtful or untrue, under this drafting, the court would need to consider that, wouldn't it?

              It is a fact that some parents will seek to manipulate or pressure their children to express certain views in family law matters. This is a complex problem. However, it is not a reason to deprive children of their human rights. Not allowing children to be heard in matters affecting them so significantly as the creation of orders about who they live with and where and where they get to see each of their parents can have devastating impacts on them. It can disempower and frustrate them, it can exacerbate any trauma they have experienced and it can lead to the creation of orders that are not in their best interests and, in the worst cases, unsafe. It is not anticipated that any of the reforms will lead to a higher degree of parental alienation or pressure from parents on children in the family law system.
             </p>
             <p>
              Key measures in the bill focus on enhancing the practice of professionals in the family law system. Over time, these are intended to contribute to ensuring that more fulsome evidence about the context of a child's relationship with their parents is provided to decision-makers, including to identify circumstances where a parent may be seeking to pressure or manipulate a child. This would enable decision-makers to consider the implications of such conduct in relation to any views the child has expressed, as well as how the conduct might be weighted in determining a child's best interests. These measures include codifying the requirement for independent children's lawyers to meet with and seek the views of the child and establishing powers to improve the standards of family report writers. The courts will also continue to have discretion around how much weight to place on the child's views in the circumstances of the case.

               Minister, with all due respect, in response to your answer to my question, let's be very clear: no-one is proposing depriving children of their rights. That was (a) not the question I put and (b) certainly not the proposition I was referring to. So no-one is proposing depriving children of their rights. This is just about bad legislative drafting. It may well be it is unintentional, hence the amendment that the coalition has moved. So I ask you again, specifically in relation to the section and the way it is drafted. The provision says:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               … in determining what is in the child's best interests … the court must consider …
              </p>
              <p>
               …   …   …
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               (b) any views expressed by the child …
              </p>
              <p>
               My question is: if a parent maliciously coaches a child to say, for example, something hurtful or untrue, under the current drafting—it is a very simple question, with a yes-or-no answer—the court would need to consider that, wouldn't it?

                The ALRC recommended removing the criteria stipulating the weight a court should give to a child's views. The simpler provision makes the importance of considering a child's views clearer on the face of the legislation. The court will still have discretion to consider a child's views in light of the child's particular circumstances and determine how much weight to place on them. It is anticipated the court would need to consider the child's views which are not relevant to the parenting proceedings and determining what is in the child's best interests.

                   Thank you for that clarification. The issue I have with the way it is drafted—and again this has been raised by way of feedback and certainly in submissions—is that it doesn't accord with the recommendations of professional bodies like the Law Council. What I put to you is that there is nothing in the drafting proposed by the government that requires a court to take into account the child's maturity, level of understanding or any other factors that it considers affect the weight the court should give to the child's views, is there?

                       That's even more confusing than when we first started out, and that's the whole point. 'The court must consider any views expressed by the child.' I think we both agree that is exactly the wording of section 60CC(2)(b). The point I'm making—and this is made in good faith, trying to make better what I believe is just bad drafting; that's all it is—is that 'must' means they must consider any views expressed by the child. Unfortunately—and this is where it goes to our amendment—there's nothing in the drafting proposed by the government that requires a court to take into account the child's maturity, level of understanding or any other factors in assessing the weight it should give to the child's view. We've agreed that there's not. The provision you just quoted, section 60CC(2)(b), does not expressly give the court any discretion. As I said, I'm doing this in good faith. If it is bad drafting, this is the reason we've put forward the amendment. In your evidence yesterday, you agreed that there would be unrepresented litigants coming before the court. To an unrepresented litigant reading the law, there's no express indication there, or even on the face of the provision, that there should be some attempt to assess or give weight to the child's views, is there?

                        The objective of the bill is to simplify the existing complex framework of considerations when a court determines what is in the best interests of the child. As under the existing framework, the courts will still need to consider the views of the child and will continue to have discretion as to the weight they give those views. What is changing is the level of prescription about the considerations judicial officers must undertake and the detail they must provide in the reasoning for their decisions. This will ensure focus remains on what is in the best interests of a particular child and is in accordance with recommendation 5 of the ALRC report.

Again, they're trying to make this legislation better; they're not disagreeing with the section. I'm saying there's bad drafting. They have called for the inclusion of a provision allowing the court to assess or give weight to a child's views. They said, 'This is significant as parents often take the view that a child's views should be determinative even at a young age.'

                           Again, I accept that answer. The provision in section 60CC(2)(b) says, 'In determining what is in the child's best interests the court must consider any views expressed by the child.' I hope that, in working through it quite genuinely, you may consider an amendment, or even supporting an amendment. To respond to, for example, the

                            Family Law
                           </a>
                           Practitioners Association of Queensland, you might consider putting in the legislation in explicit terms—for parents who are having to flick through this piece of legislation, who just don't know what they're doing and are looking at 'any views expressed by the child'—that the court has a discretion to take into account the child's maturity, level of understanding or any other factors that would affect the weight the court should give to the child's view. That is all I'm seeking the government to consider overnight. It just makes what I believe, and what others who have submitted believe, bad drafting better. And, if the whole point is simplification, this is a positive step in the right direction.

                             The issue that I'm having is this: in good faith, I am putting forward an amendment and I'm asking the government to seriously consider a way to improve this drafting. The clause is there; I understand what the clause means. The issue I have and the issue others have is: it says, 'the court must consider any views expressed by the child'. What it doesn't do in that particular clause, to give clarity to parents who are actually looking at this, is literally then say to the court that 'the court is required to take into account the child's maturity level of understanding or any other factors that it considers affect the weight the court should give to the child's view', and we've established that's not expressly there.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             What I'm saying is: an unrepresented litigant opens a piece of legislation and they will only see the words. The words don't contain that additional part which says to them that the court can also take into account these additional factors such as the maturity level of understanding et cetera.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             So, what I'm asking is: do you accept that, when someone opens the legislation, all they're going to see is the words. The way it's written creates a problem, because the impression it creates is that the child's views must be given weight no matter how young or immature the child is, and this has a particularly strong impact on people who are acting in the shadow of the law.

You have the child that is growing over this period of time—their maturity levels and separation from it.

                                       . A lot of the complaints we heard in the inquiry from parents were that there was no communication between the ICL and the children they were supposed to be representing. That is a big problem. ICLs were biased towards one client or another, and the children's best interests were not taken into consideration. It should not be up to the discretion of the ICL to determine how often they meet with the child, and once is not good enough.

                                       Also, if they say they want a support person there with them, children have that right to ask for that support person, and it should not be up to the ICL to determine whether or not they allow that support person, because the ICL can turn around say, 'They are a hostile person.' Maybe that's not up to them; it is up to the child to determine if they want a support person. I would like to see this put in the legislation so that we are protecting, as you keep referring back to all the time, the best interests of the child. Therefore, this would be in the best interests of the child if they were allowed to call on the support person that they require. Will you review this in your legislation?

                                         Sorry, but a lot of Australians wouldn't agree with you on that. As I said, court cases can go over a lengthy period of time. In the time they are in that courtroom, a child may go through from being seven up to about 10 years of age. Their opinions change. To say once only is a terrible response. That determination in this bill, I think, is poor. It is pathetic when you can't answer anything. My question was about the best interests of the child, and you tell me they only need to meet with the child once? Well, sorry, that's not good enough.

                                         s. My amendment on sheet 2131 is about ICLs needing to have better training. It says:
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic">
                                         (2A) If a lawyer has not previously been appointed as an independent children's lawyer, the court must not appoint that lawyer under subsection (2) unless the lawyer has undertaken training under an approved program.

                                         (2B) If a lawyer has previously been appointed as an independent children's lawyer and has regularly performed the functions of an independent children's lawyer for a period of 2 years or more, the court must not appoint that lawyer under subsection (2), unless:

                                        <p class="italic">
                                         (a) a period of at least one year (the interim period ) has passed since the lawyer's last appointment as an independent children's lawyer ended; and
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic">
                                         (b) during the interim period the lawyer has undertaken further training under an approved program.

                                        <p>
                                         I state this because a lot of these children's lawyers are just caught up in the system, and it's a revolving door. They just keep going with the same views. I believe that they should need updated training. Get them out of the system to do more training and then come back, so they are aware of the children's needs. A lot of these children's lawyers have not been required to even meet with the children. They've never met with the children. A lot of them wouldn't even have had the psychological training to understand a child or to interview a child to see how they feel about it. That's another thing that I need to ask you, Minister. What training do these ICLs have to have when they're dealing with children, and the psychological impacts on children, to make the best decisions to advise the courts on what's in the best interest of the child?

The training program covers topics on child development, child trauma and other matters that are essential to ICL work. ICLs also undertake additional training as part of ongoing professional development and may access guidance materials and professional support in the court of their work. The Guidelines for Independent Children's Lawyers and the Independent Children's Lawyer Practice Standards and Guidelines also provide guidance to ICLs on how to undertake their duties and safely and appropriately engage with children. ICLs may work with support from social scientists, such as psychologists employed by the legal aid commissions, or may use other sources, such as a school counsellor or a psychologist, when meeting with children. This will depend on the child's needs.

                                           Minister, can I go to the point now about recordings. If a children's lawyer is going to have an interview, and if it's up to their discretion as to whether they'll allow the child to have a support person in that meeting, should that meeting with the child be recorded? All you're relying on is that children's lawyer, who is going to put in a report to the judge, which the judge really takes into strong consideration in making their determination. Wouldn't it be in the best interests for that recording to be made available to the parents so that they know what's been put before the judge? None of this is being recorded and reported back to the parents, and I think they should have the right to have a recording.

                                             It's for the protection of the child, right? Also, why aren't interviews between parents and court reporters recorded for quality assurance? Parents should have a chance to rebut their reports. They can't do it if they can't see the reports. You have court reporters that are putting in their reports to the courts as well. Parents have no idea what is being put before the courts. Why shouldn't they have a right to have that recorded in these court reports? It's been known that some of these court reporters are not doing their jobs properly. They're putting their biased opinions to the court system, and the courts are ruling on things that are not true. It's been brought to my attention that a court reporter was putting in the same reports for different cases. They weren't even doing their jobs properly. They were just using information from a previous case. Shouldn't the parents have a right to be able to record the meetings that they have with the court reporters and have a copy of it to know what is being presented to the judge?

                                               To regulate them? You didn't answer my question. Are you going to look at giving parents the right to record the interview with the court reporters so they know what is going to be said to the judge? They have every right to know what's being put across.

Senator Hanson raised some issues in relation to the ICL, particularly in relation to discretion. That's actually not in the legislation we currently have before us. That was the point Senator Hanson was actually making. You have then said it is in the guidelines. Senator Hanson might want to explore further what those guidelines are, where those guidelines are and when those guidelines are going to be printed. Is there an amendment being moved by the government to address this, because it actually was bad drafting and there was an issue with that particular section?

                                                          The committee recommends that the Australian government removes proposed section 70NBE from the Bill to avoid duplication of the court's discretionary power to award costs in family law matters.

                                                          That recommendation is addressed through government amendments to remove proposed section 70NBE, amendment (23); adding a note referring to section 117 costs, amendment (16); and making the necessary consequential amendments as a result.

The point Senator Hanson was making was that there may be a requirement to meet more than one time. Just so we're all on the same page here, can you take us to the wording that actually shows it's not a requirement to meet once but that you could meet—
                                                            </p>

                                                             That's what I'm trying to now find out because it has got very confusing very quickly. Can you find the section that's going to be put in and read it out just so that Senator Hanson and I are both confident that the question that she asked has been addressed correctly? If not then we can pursue it some more. Where in the legislation does it say that the ICL has discretion to meet more than once?

You've got a note on that which says: 'The independent children's lawyer must perform the following duties, not necessarily at the same time: meet with the child, provide the child with an opportunity to express any views in relation to the matters to which the proceedings relate. Note: a person cannot require a child to express the child's views in relation to any matter under section 60CE.' What do you mean by that—'You cannot require a child to express the child's views in relation to any matter'?

We all know who are the main people who really are upset about this. I'm not disregarding mothers, because they've been denied the right to see their children too, but a lot of my grievances are coming from fathers who, for what they feel is no apparent reason, are denied the right to have contact with their children or see their children at all. They've actually been broken by this. These are loving families. There's no violence—or there may be false accusations brought against them which haven't been proven—but they are denied the right to see their children. A blog article entitled 'A father's impact on child development', which is on the website all4kids.org, has the subheading '10 facts about father engagement'. I'll just read out a couple:
                                                                  </p>
                                                                  <p class="italic">
                                                                   Children who feel a closeness to their father are: twice as likely as those who do not to enter college or find stable employment after high school, 75% less likely to have a teen birth, 80% less likely to spend time in jail, and half as likely to experience multiple depression symptoms.
                                                                  </p>

Non-resident fathers can have positive effects on children's social and emotional well-being, as well as academic achievement and behavioral adjustment.

Many theories have been explored to explain the poor state of our nation's children. However, a factor that has been largely ignored, particularly among child and family policymakers, is the prevalence and devastating effects of father absence in children's lives.

It goes far beyond this. Parents should have an involvement in their children's lives. It goes beyond even what school they go to and their education. It also goes to our nation's problem with gender dysphoria. Are you going to allow one parent to have complete control over the child and say whether they can go and have puberty blockers or mutilation or whatever, while the other parent has no say in it whatsoever? That's virtually what you are doing here. You are taking away a parent's right to have a say over their child's future and their wellbeing, and you are going to let the courts decide this.

They can have step-parents, by all means, but they only have one mum and one dad. You are denying these parents their rights, by taking this out of the legislation. You are going against the

The proposed amendment does not address the misunderstanding associated with the terminology, that equal shared parental responsibility means equal time rather than relating to joint decision-making on major long-term issues. Further, this amendment does not address the fact that the evidence shows that the presumption is currently regularly applied in the presence of safety concerns, despite the legislation specifying it should not apply in cases of abuse of a child or family violence. The retention of any presumption detracts from the focus of the best interests of the child.
                                                                   </p>

                                                                    In terms of some of the other broader points you made, Senator Hanson, I disagree with a lot of it and I don't think it did your arguments any favours to go to some of the culture wars, as you did. The intention of these amendments is not to see less custody for fathers. What is changing is a formulaic reasoning process which has contributed to a misconception that parents are entitled to equal time with a child rather than focusing on what is in the child's best interest. Where it is in the child's best interest, the outcome will be that both parents will be making decisions jointly and in equal time or a substantial and significant time arrangement. For a small number of children, it will be in their best interests that one parent will be making decisions and that there is with the other parent. These reforms will ensure that the best interests of the individual child are considered.

The government's approach is that the full repeal is the most direct approach to addressing misunderstanding about this issue amongst the general public. Any presumptions about parental responsibility can take the focus away from the child's needs. They can encourage parents to negotiate in their own interest or to agree arrangements despite their safety concerns because they think this is required by law. They are also an additional step in the court's decision-making process, adding time and cost to proceedings.
                                                                     </p>

It is widely misunderstood as creating an entitlement for parents to have equal fifty-fifty time with their children. The joint select committee recommended the government urgently release exposure draft legislation to amend section 61DA to address the current misunderstanding that equal shared parental responsibility equates to equal time with children.

The ALRC suggested rewording it to be 'a presumption of joint decision-making about major long-term issues'; however, the government considers that renaming the presumption would not sufficiently address the safety concerns associated with this application. For example, the

This is a strong indicator that the presumption is not working as intended even when matters are determined by a court.

The fact is that the presumption of parents is that they have a fifty-fifty right. Isn't it funny that one day both parents can be in a house looking after their child and the child's best interests, and then, just because there's been a separation and they're not living under the one roof anymore, you want to deny the other parent the presumption that they can have that as a starting point. If it was a starting point, at least they'd get fifty-fifty shared responsibility in parenting rights with their children. But all of a sudden that's out the door. It's: 'Sorry. You moved out of the house. You've lost your rights to be a parent to that child anymore.' Things were alright the day before, but within a matter of hours you want to take that full responsibility away from them. How are these parents supposed to feel? Shouldn't you give them some hope that they are going to at least be listened to? Your bill is taking that right away from them.
                                                                      </p>
                                                                      <p>
                                                                       You talk about the safety of the child. All of this is presented in the courts. This is going to be presented by the lawyers. If there are real concerns for the wellbeing of the child, they will be taken into consideration by the courts. These parents should at least go into the courtroom thinking that they're going to have a fair hearing, that they will have some time with their children. I don't know if you have many people contact you about the problems they've had with the family law courts and being denied the right to see their children. I've got fathers who haven't seen their kids for years. I've even had some mothers contact me to say they can't see their children. I can tell you about one case. A woman contacted my office and said, 'The
                                                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICL" rel="nofollow">

                                                                       </a>
                                                                       '—this is an ICL, mind you; they can be biased—'declared a mother to be negligent because she hadn't had a COVID vaccination and neither had her two teenage children.' Do you know what the ICL's recommendation was? The ICL reported to the court that she was a negligent mother, and, hence, the court ordered that she couldn't see the children. Even to this day she can't see the children. It was the ICL's decision, just because she hadn't had a vax and the teenagers didn't want to have the vaccination, and she was denied the right to see her children.
                                                                      </p>

They have a right then to defend their case before the courts. They don't know the reports that are being put up before the judge. They don't know what they should be answering to the judge in some sort of defence. This woman has been denied the right to see her children based on an ICL's biased opinion as to whether or not someone should have a vaccine. I think that's absolutely disgraceful.
                                                                      </p>

People have a right to have a recording of the court reporters and of the ICLs with the children. They have a right to know what's being said behind closed doors. Some of these biased people with their own views are not giving parents a fair go in the family law court system. That's why we have more problems going on now, because people are distraught. Suicides are happening. This is why we have the harm that is happening among males and females who are fed up with the family law court system. They're finding no justice there. That's why we have the problems that are happening, the murders that are happening. It is all because of the family law courts. It is because of sheer frustration. They've had a gutful of it and they can't take it anymore. Until you get this right and give people a fair go, you're not going to change anything. You're making it worse.

Paragraph 65DAAA(2)(b) of the bill stipulates that, when deciding whether it will be the best interests of the child to consider a final parenting order, the court may take into account whether there is any new material available that was not available to the court that made the final decision. The proposed amendment removes the word 'new' from this subparagraph in response to stakeholder feedback that the inclusion of 'new' could lead to legal arguments about what 'new' means. This amendment makes it clear the court may have regard to material that was in existence at the time of the court proceedings but was not considered by the court at the time.

I just want to clarify some of the responses given to Senator Hanson. The evidence the minister gave was that none of the major inquiries recommended the full repeal of the presumption.

The government's approach on full repeal is that is the most direct approach to addressing misunderstandings about the issue amongst the general public. Any presumptions about parental responsibility can take the focus away from the child's needs and can encourage parents to negotiate in their own interests or to agree to agreements despite their safety concerns because they think this is required by law. There is also an additional step in the court's decision-making process adding time and cost to proceedings. None of the major inquiries into the family law system have supported the presumption in its current form. It is widely misunderstood as creating an entitlement for parents to have equal, fifty-fifty time. I mentioned that the joint select committee recommended the government urgently release the exposure draft. I mentioned the 2017 House Standing Committee on

This is a strong indicator that the presumption is not working as intended, even where matters are determined by a court.

The committee believes that the Parliamentary intention could be significantly reinforced if courts were required to consider the presumption of shared responsibility in each case that they consider.

The point that Senator Hanson and I are exploring is the fact that, in this legislation, the government repeals it in its entirety. Do you now accept, as the Labor Party did in 2003, that the presumption was a response to the outcomes of many, many years of Family Court cases that were decided without any kind of legislative guidance on the value of shared parenting?

I think your view of the Attorney-General is colouring your analysis there, Senator Cash. The removal of the presumption is supported by evidence that shows that orders for shared parental responsibility are made in the majority of litigated matters and in the presence of these family violence and safety concerns.

They are not my assessments; they are the assessments of Professor Parkinson, based on the available data. The Attorney-General clearly stated, in his articles in the newspapers that I referred to:

Although he was critical of the 2006 reforms for delivering, in his words, 'prolonged litigation and conflict', that, in fact, was not borne out by the evaluation of the reforms conducted by the

That research, prepared by Kaspiew and others and published in December 2009, concluded, among other things, that, while safety concerns were present for some, the Howard-era care reforms resulted in, 'better quality inter-parental relationships'.

Stakeholder feedback on the exposure draft also reaffirmed this misconception can lead to vulnerable parties agreeing to unsafe and unfair parenting arrangements.

You've taken it from a joint House inquiry into this. I can tell you, Minister, that I was deputy chair of a Senate inquiry. We did haven't the expertise. We didn't understand. We were just guided by the evidence that was given to us to try and understand it. Here you have professional people that have advised you that it should not have been taken out completely but possibly reworded. With regard to this, at what point did you have discussions with the chief justice or the deputy chief justice of the family law courts to get their opinions?

We're talking about the most important part of this legislation, which my phones have been ringing hot about, and you're telling me it's confidential. We're not going to hear what they have to say about it? I think that is a poor answer on your behalf to the people of Australia. You won the election—well, you didn't win it, on 32 per cent, but you run the government—and the whole fact is that you're telling me that you're open and honest with the people of Australia? You were going to lead a government that would be there for the people—that would be accountable to the people. I'm asking you for something that's important to the people of Australia, and you can't give it. Do you know why? I believe it's because it's not there. I think you have misled this chamber. I don't think you're being up-front about it and I don't think the chief justice was actually consulted. I tell you what, if they had consulted the minister, if they made this comment about consultation and advice then that would have been on the record because it would be very important. If they had stated that it should be taken out then you would be forthcoming with it, but you are not, so I don't believe that you're being up-front about this. You can reflect on that unless you want to answer me. I'd be quite happy to hear your answer to that one. Have you got anything to say, Minister?

Your answer to my question, 'Did the Attorney take the report into account?' was that the joint select committee had taken into consideration reports as listed. The issue I have is the Attorney-General can't have taken that report into account because the way Justice Chisholm described his recommendations was as follows:
                                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                                              These recommendations are intended to retain the essential ideas of the Hull Committee in 2003, while removing difficulties and unintended consequences that appear to have occurred as a result of the way the original idea has been translated into legislation.
                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                             <p>

But the Attorney expressly decided to ignore advice given to his government when it was last in power. Isn't that correct?

Again, I will try to get a copy of those and come back to you—or you may be able to provide the answer shortly. As I mentioned before, the removal of the presumption is supported by evidence that shows that orders for shared parental responsibility are made in the majority of litigated matters and in the presence of family violence and safety concerns. I mentioned the

They supported the removal of the presumption, as they stated in their Senate submission. Again, stakeholder feedback on the exposure draft also reaffirmed that this misconception can lead to vulnerable parties agreeing to unsafe and unfair parenting arrangements and can provide ongoing avenues for continued coercive and controlling behaviour between partners where family violence is an issue.

The answer is: it wasn't, because the reports didn't make a recommendation to repeal the presumption. The reason I'm going through it report by report is that we're talking about a body of evidence here and the weight of evidence. The point that I'm making—and I believe Senator Hanson, through the evidence she is reading into the record, is also making—is that the Attorney has represented to the Australian people that there were more than two dozen inquiries into the family law system and has implied that the repeal of the presumption was supported by those inquiries. Based on the evidence that I'm going through—and we will continue to go through more evidence—this is, I argue, both untrue and misleading.

What we're establishing here as we go through report after report after report—some of them bipartisan and unanimous and, in fact, heralded at the time as landmark reports—is the true basis for the repeal. Everybody agrees that it needs to be redrafted. Everybody agrees that it needs to be simplified. But the government has gone much further than that. It has been redrafted completely to remove it, so it is no longer there. We are establishing that the true basis for the repeal is an ideologically motivated policy decision of this Attorney-General.

So we can just throw out all of the reports and the recommendations, as long as we can find a submission—and that's easy to find; the government just directs someone to put in a submission that supports the government's position. This committee has taken a very, very bizarre twist tonight because it would appear that it doesn't matter what report Senator Hanson and I put to you, if you don't like the recommendation you'll just find a submission that supported the view you've put forward, even though in the final recommendation it does the exact opposite.
                                                                                                                             </p>

I'll make it a rhetorical question, because you're clearly not going to refer to the actual recommendation. You'll refer to submissions that back in the Attorney-General's position. That's not what the recommendations said.

On 14 March 2018, it released an issues paper that expressly referenced the committee's suggestion of removing the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility as a potential reform to the decision-making framework in part 7 of the

But, in fact, after the ALRC did its due diligence, in its report it recommended the wording of the presumption be changed, and it even prepared draft legislation to do so. Isn't that correct? Please ask the advisers. I don't expect you to know.

This is a strong indicator that the presumption is not working as intended, even where matters are determined by a court.

                                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                                The ALRC supports the idea that a presumption of shared parental responsibility serves as a good starting point for negotiations between parents and recommends that the concept be retained. The ALRC also agrees in principle with the existing exceptions to that presumption, but recommends redrafting the exceptions as set out in Appendix G.
                                                                                                                               </p>

The ALRC recommends that, to reduce confusion, s 61DA be redrafted to refer to 'joint decision making on major long-term issues'.
                                                                                                                               </p>

In our view, that is a strong indicator that presumption is not working as intended, even when matters are determined by a court. The Australian Institute of Family Studies, from the very first evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms after the introduction of a concept of equally shared parental responsibility, found that there was a common misunderstanding that the presumption related to shared care time and, further, the study noted that this confusion has resulted in disillusionment amongst some fathers who find that the law does not provide for fifty-fifty custody.

So that is part of the government decision-making.

And, as I mentioned, stakeholder feedback on the exposure draft also reaffirmed that the misconceptions led to vulnerable parties agreeing to unsafe and unfair parenting arrangements, and can provide ongoing avenues for continued coercive and controlling behaviour between partners and where family violence is an issue.

You've got Professor Chisholm who's actually said it. Professor Patrick has also said it. It should be included in there. You've taken from advocacy groups. Minister, I asked you the question, and you said self-interest groups have advised you to actually take this out. Is one of the groups the Greens?

I refer to that where there is any new material. That concerns me. Do you understand which paragraph I'm at—whether there is any new material available that was not available to the court that made the final parenting order? I'm going back to that because, after a case has been settled, what if there has been something that's happened, perhaps with domestic violence, in that period of time? By taking the word 'new' out, you're not allowing them to bring new evidence to the court; it has to be based on evidence they had previously in court because you've taken out the word 'new'. I don't understand—if you can please clarify this for me—why you have taken out 'new'. If the case is a year or two old, or even a few months old, if anything has happened, what evidence are you going to limit them to presenting to the courts again because circumstances may have changed?

Subparagraph 65DAAA(2)(b) of the bill stipulates that, when deciding whether it will be the best interests of the child to reconsider a final parenting order, the court may take into account whether there is any new material available that was not available to the court that made the final parenting order. The proposed amendment removes the word 'new' from this subparagraph in response to stakeholder feedback that the inclusion of 'new' could lead to legal arguments about what 'new' means. This amendment makes it clear the court may have regard to material that was in existence at the time of the court proceedings but was not considered by the court at the time.

You referred me to section 117. Besides that, under the current legislation what you've got now is the general capability of the court towards costs. What's been correctly highlighted is that you've now got rid of the fact that the contravention of orders is evidence that is unsubstantiated highlighting the fact—they can't award costs against the person. You've gone back to general capability for the costs to be awarded. By changing the legislation people who bring evidence before the courts are not going to have costs awarded for them, against the litigant. My understanding is that, by changing this now, people who have claims to make or contraventions of orders are not going to get costs awarded to them, which is going to stop this in the court system.

The review, as proposed by this bill, is the preferred approach by the government that allows for the most appropriate review mechanism to be decided in due course. In addition, with regard to the matters that you raise around legal fees, the scope of the review that we propose in the legislation would be settled in due course.

                                                                                                                                                As I said, that's a huge disappointment because that was one of the main things that was raised. People have lost their homes over this and are paying off debts years afterwards. They then have to pay child support on top of this—what has been awarded against them. All they are fighting for is the right to have contact with the children. So that's another blow to them. They thought there might be some justice and they would be able to rein in what these lawyers are charging, the overservicing and keeping cases going. What is happening is just outrageous, and you've turned a blind eye to this and are not listening to what the Australian people said in their submissions to the last inquiry that was held by the joint committee. I have another amendment that I will be putting up. It is about the family violence orders. It says:
                                                                                                                                               </p>

It is a matter for the court what weight is given to any evidence put before it. The government has proposed amendments which ensure the court must expressly include consideration of the history of family violence abuse and neglect in any family violence orders when determining the parenting arrangements that would promote the safety of the child and their caregivers.

Surveys have been held—and this has come out from the judges—about what is happening in the court system. In 90 per cent of these hearings, the judge found no risk of sexual harm to the child or children. In 25 per cent of these cases, the allegations were found to have been deliberately misleading. In another 46 per cent of these cases, the allegations were mistaken. This has been happening in the court system. I'll also refer to Family Court judge

He said that most of the allegations made to the court, over the 14-year period he was there, were for the parent's own gain and were used as a tactic to stop their partner from getting the children. Also, 90 per cent of the parents alleging child sexual abuse in contested hearings from 2012-19 were the mother. The fact is this is used. It was part of the inquiry as well. A lot of the evidence and submissions were about allegations of sexual abuse, which are being thrown around like confetti by too many people out there, and no proof is warranted.

If a witness is a protected witness the Court will consider making orders in accordance with Annexure C of this direction. If no orders are required a trial date will be set at the review mentioned and the matter will progress in the ordinary way.

In fact, if a person is unrepresented in a court the judge cannot bring a case against them. The judge does not have to inform the court about the person who doesn't contest it.

If they have legal representation, they are advised by their lawyers to contest without an admission to it. If you understand what I'm saying, they contest without an admission to it—that's if they have legal representation. I'll leave it up to Senator Cash while I find my notes.

Therefore, they have been put into a position where the courts take that into consideration. If you don't have legal representation, the courts cannot accept that. So they are then protected more. I'll tell people watching: 'Do not consent without admission. That can do you more harm in the court system. You should not consent to anything.' That is the problem.
                                                                                                                                                   </p>

We have no definition of domestic violence. There are numerous types of domestic violence: physical domestic violence, coercive domestic violence and other forms of domestic violence. But this is what I said to you yesterday: if you're going to present allegations of domestic violence in a family law court then, if there is proof of it, charges should be laid and it should be determined in another court, and then it can be presented to the family law court, not just put in an affidavit or said in the court on the spur of the moment to enhance a person's case. Will you look at putting this in? As I say again, my amendment is to protect people against false allegations. A number of judges have raised this point. They need protecting, because a lot of people use it as a defence of claims that are not true or of which there's no proof.

Obviously, the issues you're talking about there would largely be dealt with by states and territories. The family courts deal with the most difficult cases, with less than three per cent of separated families coming before the court. Those matters often concern significant allegations of child abuse and exposure to family violence. The government's information-sharing bill will be critical to ensuring that judges have the best evidence and information available to them so that they can make well-informed decisions about the risk of maltreatment. This is also why these bills place children at the centre of the family law system so that decisions can be made in their best interests and to keep them safe. So, to reiterate, we won't be supporting your amendment, Senator Hanson.

He is very happy to refer to the very many reviews of the family law system that have taken place extensively over a number of years when it comes to equal shared parental responsibility, but none of the major reviews I have referred to actually recommends the repeal. Despite the Attorney-General implying to the Australian public that he has taken on board their feedback, the legislation that we have in front of us in no way accords with what those recommendations are.

I want to explore this, because the courts know—it is set out in the legislation—that the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to suspect abuse or violence. The courts also know, as is currently set out in the legislation, that the presumption is a rebuttable presumption. Therefore, presumably in all of the cases that the Australian Institute of Family Studies referred to, the courts would have had to consider the evidence and must have therefore concluded, given that (a) it's a rebuttable presumption and (b) it doesn't apply in the event, as I said, if there is a suspicion of violence or abuse, that there were no reasonable grounds to suspect violence or abuse. So, in your answer, Minister, this isn't, as you have put to Senator Hanson, an indicator that the presumption isn't working as intended. It is an indicator that, while safety concerns may well have been raised in the courts—they would have been duly considered—the courts have nevertheless found it appropriate to make an order for shared parental responsibility. So the evidence that you have given in response to Senator Hanson's line of questioning, the only way that your reference to the Australian Institute of Family Studies' evidence can in any way justify the repeal of the presumption, is that you are saying that the courts have consistently got it wrong.

That is the evidence you gave to Senator Hanson. The point I'm making is that is what you are in part basing the Attorney-General's stance in relation to the repeal on. What I'm putting to you is we have a small issue with what you've said, because the courts know the presumption doesn't apply if there are reasonable grounds to suspect abuse or violence. They also know presumption is rebuttable. If you accept that, and I put it to you that you have to because its in the legislation, even if these issues have been raised and the courts have due duly considered them, they have then taken them into consideration and therefore have decided that, despite this, it is appropriate to make an order for shared parental responsibility. So, again, I put to you: the only way your reference to the AIFS evidence can in any way justify the repeal of the presumption is if you're saying the courts have got it consistently wrong.

They and other stakeholders also found that people didn't raise allegations because of a misunderstanding of the presumption as well.

It is completely at odds with what the evidence shows in relation to what the courts take into consideration. Unfortunately, we have all of 35 minutes left and we are going to hit a hard marker.

The presumption itself was introduced with the support of Labor, following a detailed, unanimous and bipartisan consideration of the actual issue. It's worth again being clear on exactly what the presumption is. The presumption the court applies is this:
                                                                                                                                                         </p>

It does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65DAA).

'The profession' are people that read the law, I would hope apply it, get to understand it and then act on behalf of people in court. They are saying that we had one mess and—guess what!—you've replaced it with another mess.

However, a number of stakeholders raised specific concerns about the operational cost orders in the enforcement regime and the duplicity of a cost order provision being contained in this division, when the courts have a general power to make orders for costs in section 117 of the act. This has been addressed by adopting the Senate committee recommendation 3 to remove cost orders from division 13A.

Why do I say that? Because, for anybody listening in and for anyone who is involved or has been involved in family law proceedings, you will know that this deals with the enforcement of parenting orders. This is an incredibly important part of the bill because there are consequences in relation to you breaching one. Failures to comply with parenting orders are often some of the most difficult and damaging parts.

Don't be fooled by the Attorney-General of Australia's submission to you that says, 'Hey, guess what, I'm simplifying the system and making it easier for you,' because that's not what the ACT Bar Association says. And in response to what the minister said to me about the evidence of the Law Council of Australia, let me just reiterate what the Law Council itself says:

You're probably, quite frankly, better off with the current system. At least people understand that it's a complete complex mess. All you're going to be doing now is trying to interpret another complex mess.

Could 50 people be in a kinship system? Could 100 people be in a kinship system? I will assume that the department does have the answers to those questions, because this is an incredibly important potential consequence of the changes. What is going to happen to those people who are now included in this kinship system? There are actually potential legal consequences for them.

                                                                                                                                                                        In addition, this broadened definition would result in an extension of the notification provisions for disclosing involvement with child protection agencies. This imposes a more onerous notification requirement on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, which could effectively include all interactions between any member of the kinship group and child protection authorities. If this is not the intended purpose of the legislation, the Law Council recommends the inclusion of a provision clarifying that the notification requirement does not extend to certain persons within the kinship group who are not connected through the particular circumstances of the case.
                                                                                                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                                                                                                        So the effect of the change as introduced was to apply the notification obligation to a much wider group of people. You would have an obligation to notify the court even if the people involved were not raising the child, but you'd never need to raise it for a non-Indigenous family. I accept that your government's amendments belatedly change the definition to deal with the obligations to notify the court about family violence—I personally don't know why it took you so long—but how does your amendment deal with the risk of people being subpoenaed, as raised by the Law Council?

So that means that, in relation to one of the most important bills to ever come before the Australian parliament, we do not have an appropriate time to actually interrogate it. I would have thought that—based on the questions that are being asked, the body of evidence that has been provided and the insufficient answers that are being given—anybody listening in would know we are not going to be doing justice to this bill.

Every year, thousands of Australians will find themselves going through the pain and sadness of separation, and, in a small proportion of those cases, disputes will be decided by a judge in Australia's family law courts. As a nation, we should aim for a system that resolves those disputes as quickly and cleanly as possible. Regardless of the circumstances, if children are involved, we should at all times prioritise their best interests.

In 2003 we recognised that outcomes in the family law system were not meeting community expectations, and we worked for years to build the bipartisanship that led to the historic, landmark 2006 reforms. Those reforms changed the approach to family law to reduce litigation—that is a fact; I've read out the evidence—and improve outcomes across the family law system. In 2019 we recognised that the Family Court system had become inefficient and slow, burdened by a dual court system that was drawing out the pain of family law litigation for too many families. The courts merger under the former government, which finally went ahead in 2021, has been a stunningly successful project—the evidence shows this—that has drastically reduced the wait time for Australian families.

We have been consistent in this. Throughout this debate we have said publicly and repeatedly that we recognise that many of the issues this bill seeks to address are problems in need of a solution. We have been constructive. We have followed the recommendations of bodies like the

We do not agree with the solutions adopted in many places in this bill. It is not a bill that has been worked through over many years. It is not even a bill that has been subject to proper scrutiny. There are actually more schedules in the bill than there have been hours of committee inquiry. It is embarrassing. Even with the small amount of scrutiny that we have been able to give, it has become increasingly clear that the government consistently puts its ideological agenda over the best interest of Australian families. Let's face it: yesterday the government started falling apart after just 90 minutes. We come in here today and find that this debate is being guillotined.
                                                                                                                                                                             </p>

In its changes to the parenting framework, we have the absurd situation of the Attorney deciding to remove every piece of guidance from the objects and principles, and we went through that in detail. By removing those provisions, the government sends a disturbing message: the parenting framework is no longer intended to achieve outcomes like parents cooperating in the care of their children.

In fact, it's the exact opposite. It has only confirmed what so many have said: a political and ideological approach of a left-wing Labor government. We have the Attorney-General of Australia ignoring the recommendations arriving from the years of careful reviews, which acknowledged that the drafting could be improved—which, as I said, we agree with—but repeated that the principle of equal shared parental responsibility is sound. Instead of the measured approach that adopts the work of independent and expert bodies, as I have outlined tonight, the Attorney-General has adopted the preferred ideological approach of three Labor backbenchers.

What is this going to do? One, it's going to act as a disincentive. Why would you bother? Two, it adds time, cost and delay.

As we know, the change to schedule 8 is a political decision, recommended by no-one. But we have had the minister here tonight telling us how the Attorney-General relied on different pieces of evidence. The change to schedule 8 is a political decision that is intended to give Mr Dreyfus a trigger to demerge the courts after the next election. This is despite the body of evidence that shows that the merger of the two courts has had positive benefits for families in Australia.

We could have made the bill better. But, at every step, Labor has put ideology over the needs of Australian families. Australian families would do well to remember the arrogance and intransience of this government and, particularly, of this Attorney-General. As I said, there are parts of this package that we agree with, and there are other parts where it is pretty obvious that there are problems. It is not just the opposition saying there are problems; it is a body of evidence, experts, saying that there are problems. The government has been warned.

In fact, I might actually see if Senator Hanson wants to make any comments. There are nine minutes left, Senator Hanson. I've made my final statements, if you'd like to make any comments.

When I referred to the legal costs, I forgot to say what the committee said in the second interim report about legal costs. I put this in my amendment and I ask you to look at it because the legal fees are killing a lot of families. The committee recommended a legislated limit on the fees a legal practitioner may charge a party to a proceeding, set at either $50,000 or 10 per cent of the combined value of the asset pool, including superannuation, whichever is higher. The recommendation provides that greater fees may be charged in exceptional circumstances with leave of the court.

This is a complex issue, as there are a number of contributing factors to the cost of family law matters, such as delays in court processes, the issues in dispute, the behaviour and attitude of the parties, timely access to support services and alternative forms of dispute resolution, the duration of proceedings and the number of court events.

You keep saying 'it is in the best interests of the child'. It is in the best interests of the child that their parents actually do have a roof over their head and don't lose that roof in the court system to the cost of lawyers' fees and charges. Some people were saying that the fees were around $200,000 to $300,000. One family paid over $1 million in court costs. So I am asking you again: will you consider capping legal fees, which was the committee's recommendation? The other thing that you've taken out are the costs that can be awarded for false allegations of domestic violence. Why did you take out the costs to do with domestic violence?

Anyway, we're down to five minutes and I'm just going to sum up how I've assessed this whole lot. I appreciate the fact that, when we put this extension of time forward to ask you the questions, the crossbench and Senator Pocock actually supported this extra time that we have been given to have this debate tonight.
                                                                                                                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                   The answers that I believe that I've got out of the minister tonight have been poor, pathetic and unprofessional. I don't believe he's really across the brief and he doesn't know exactly what he's doing. It's very good that he has his team of advisers there to tell him what to say and do. I'm here by myself. There are no advisers around me. I'm trying to deal with this, trying to get my head across this piece of legislation. I've had to get my head across a piece of legislation that they've drafted, but, at the end of the day, there are pages and pages of amendments to their own bill which they couldn't even get right. I'm trying to go through these amendments to their own bill, and they couldn't even get it right in the first place.
                                                                                                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                   The biggest thing that I found tonight that we've spoken about as part of this legislation is the fifty-fifty shared parental responsibility, and they have completely taken it out of the bill. It was recommended by the ALRC to actually not take it out but to reword it. The minister stood and said it was confusing—that was their excuse! It is confusing to people. They thought they had fifty-fifty per cent of custody over the children. That was determined, and it's up to the legal people to explain to them what it is about.
                                                                                                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                   As I have said, the people in the courts who are actually going for custody—all they're fighting for is time to see their own children, to be involved in their children's lives. You're actually cutting them out of that now. You're going to leave it up to the court system to give full responsibility to one parent. You're cutting the other parent out of their life. Do you know the psychological damage you are going to be doing to these children, because who knows that that one person is going to make the right decisions for that child?

                                                                                                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                   Then, what happens? I'll tell you of a case where the mother got custody of the child and she didn't want the father to see the child until the child was 13 or 14 years of age. We're talking about a child who, at that time, was four years of age. She didn't want the father to have anything to do with the child, but the courts didn't say that. They said, 'No, the father can have contact with the child every second weekend.' So what happened was, she was given full custody of the child as far as schooling, education, health—everything. Guess what? She couldn't handle the child. By the time the child was seven years of age, she rang up the father and said, 'You can take him.' Now the father has the child, but she's got the full responsibility of controlling the healthcare card, the schooling, the education and all the rest of it or there are threats. So what does the father do then? You've taken away the shared parental responsibility so the father has ended up with the child. This mother said, 'No, you can't see her until 14.' She couldn't control the child anymore—it was disrupting her life with the new boyfriend. So she's actually dumped the child on the father. This is not just an isolated case. This is what's happening.

                                                                                                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                   I'm just saying: Review this legislation. Have a look at these couple of things that have been raised here tonight because they're important. It's not just my point of view. I'm speaking on behalf of a lot of parents out there—not just men. I stand and fight for men's rights, by all means I do. I also fight for women's rights, but I think men have copped a raw deal in our court system because I think a lot of people have lied about domestic violence issues to gain support for their own case, and this is so wrong.
                                                                                                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                   This is so wrong, so I'll tell the parents out there: You brought that child into the world. You are both parents to that child, and it's about time you get rid of your selfishness and your vindictiveness and you actually start treating that child not as a piece of equipment or an asset that you can pass around and use at your convenience. It's about you conversing with each other, communicating and, as the government says, what's in the best interests of the child. That's my main concern; it's about the child. Many people want to be fantastic, good parents out there, but you're denying them that right.
