        Minister, you heard me asking about consultation in my second reading debate contribution. There was a roundtable held by Treasury in 2018. They invited the big banks along. They invited the big players along. That's not in question; I'm not seeking an answer on that. I just want to understand why the government hasn't engaged some of the co-ops and mutuals in relation to this. What was the logic behind doing that—only sticking with the big banks?

         Apparently the proposal was in fact shared with COBA members. The issue of access to patient capital for small and medium enterprises was flagged in separate reports in 2018 from the

          Just to clarify my understanding of your answer, I do understand that Treasury and, indeed, the Small Business Ombudsman had produced a report. I am just talking about direct contact. We all live busy lives and we don't all have time to keep a watch on what the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
           Reserve Bank
          </a>
          governor or the Small Business Ombudsman are putting up on their websites. There's that old scene from

           to the Galaxy
          </i>
          , where they said, 'Yes, of course, there was consultation. It was down the broken stairs in the locker room where the lights didn't work, in a safe with the doors shut and the combination lock twisted; of course, there was consultation'. I am really trying to get to the level of consultation that took place with those smaller banks.

More importantly, as I said in my last answer, the proposal was in fact provided to COBA members in February 2019—and perhaps they're still down the end of the corridor in the back of the safe—and the Bank of Queensland and Rabobank also participated in the

              I would like to ask a follow-on question. The Australian Shareholders Association have written to the committee and to senators saying that they're very concerned that the Business Growth Fund could lead to the disenfranchisement of retail investors by excluding them from investing in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
               SME
              </a>
              s that otherwise would have been conducted by initial public offerings on the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASX" rel="nofollow">
               ASX
              </a>
              . We heard evidence last Friday from a company specialising in offering
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPO" rel="nofollow">
               IPO
              </a>
              s. Why haven't you consulted with the stockbroking fraternity on this, given their clear concern that, due to the prudential advantages, which have been outlined in our second readers, from the taxpayer funding, the Business Growth Fund will have an unassailably low cost of capital that no other investor will be able to match?

               The Business Growth Fund is designed to fill a specific gap in Australia's equity finance market. As I said earlier, there were separate reports from the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
                RBA
               </a>
               and Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman that identified that specific gap in the long-term patient equity capital market. The gap is not directly addressed by venture capital and neither is it addressed by private equity. That patient capital can provide entrepreneurs with the finance that is needed to expand without relinquishing control of their businesses. Equivalent funds have been established in the UK and in Canada, and they have shown that there is in fact a need for this type of finance and that patient capital investment can be very profitable for investors while supporting new businesses. It is important to note that there are around 40,000
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
                SME
               </a>
               s in the target market for the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGF" rel="nofollow">
                BGF
               </a>
               and that, when fully matured, the BGF will invest in around 30 to 50 SMEs per year. So it will not compete with private equity or venture capital.

                Minister, there is growing concern from the Australian people that our industries and manufacturing businesses are being bought out by foreign investment. This bill states, as the Treasurer said in his speech on the floor of parliament on 5 December:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Established Australian businesses will be eligible for long-term equity capital investments between $5 million and $15 million.
               </p>
               <p>
                Minister, is it in the bill that they have to be Australian businesses—Australian owned businesses?

                  Yes, they are operating in Australia, but we're looking at an input of $100 million from the Commonwealth government, $100 million from the big four banks and $20 million from each of the smaller banks. That's a total of $540 million. If we're going to put that money into businesses here in Australia, people would like to know that it's going to be propping up Australian owned businesses and companies in Australia. We're now selling a lot through foreign investment. A big concern is selling lines to the Chinese milk company. Look at the sale of the

                  </a>
                  . Under the foreign trade agreement, the Chinese agreed to inject $100 million into that investment. That never happened. They're now asking the government for a handout to the tune of $100 million. Would that company now be eligible under this bill for that loan, considering it is a Chinese owned dairy company that exports two plane loads of milk back to China every week?

                   The intention of the Commonwealth with this bill is that it will be for Australian-owned and majority-Australian-owned businesses. This will be fleshed out in the shareholder agreement, which will be finalised very soon. It's absolutely the Commonwealth's intention that this fund will support Australian-owned and majority-Australian-owned businesses. In addition, the bill specifically refers to its objective being to increase investment in small and medium Australian enterprises. That's specified in section 3 of the bill.

                    I direct my comments to the chamber—Senator Patrick, this amendment would fundamentally alter the proposal to make it strictly an underwriting fund with no ability to make direct equity investments. While Labor believes there may be merits to the fund underwriting investments, we do not believe that altering the bill via legislative amendment is the right approach in this instance.
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
                     The Commonwealth
                    </a>
                    is only a minority shareholder in the proposed fund, which means any substantive change would need to be renegotiated by the remaining shareholders, and the proposal has not been subjected to sufficient analysis or stakeholder consultation. Labor has sought, and been provided with, undertakings from the government that it supports the fund's potential to underwrite investments that are consistent with the investment mandate.

                         Actually this is a fund where we're spending $100 million of taxpayers' money. I presume you're suggesting here that the chamber not be allowed to see what that investment mandate is. If it exists, even in draft form, it would be proper for you to table it and make it available for people to see.

                           At this point, what exactly is not ready about it? We know that this fund will take some time to set up. We know the banks are considering it. There's work going on. It begs the question: why would you ask the Senate to vote on it when we are blind as to the mandate? Indeed, if there is a draft mandate that is in existence that you've provided to Labor, why would you simply not table that in draft form, understanding all the caveats around that, and provide it to the Senate?

                                 I have some questions in relation to competitive neutrality. It is an issue that was raised at the economics committee. There clearly would be some concern in respect of the government breaching its own competitive neutrality policy. It's a longstanding policy. It's been around since 1996. What due diligence have you done in relation to that? When did you do that due diligence? What is the contingency the government has in circumstances where the complaints office finds that it is a breach of the policy?

                                  would be subject to competitive neutrality policy. That agency has not yet considered whether the design of the BGF is consistent with the policy. In a full assessment of any competitive neutrality complaint, the AGCNCO would hear from all parties and consider all the evidence in coming to a judgement.

                                   That just clarifies that it does fall within the jurisdiction of the complaints office. The latter part of my question—and I appreciate that it was a long question—went to the government's contingency in respect of a complaint being made and the office making a finding that indeed the growth fund does breach the policy. In the future, it's clearly a possibility. Would that mean that the government would cease to engage in the fund? What's likely to happen? What would your response be to a negative finding?

                                    I think that it's very hard to anticipate what that claim of breach of competitive neutrality would look like in advance. Of course, you would have to consider it at the time. More importantly, though, an amendment has been put forward by the opposition to review the Business Growth Fund within a period of three years, and I would imagine that that would be one of the major considerations that would come up during that review.

                                     Minister, can I have clarification over your comments about Australian businesses. As you may have seen, I've circulated an amendment to this bill.
                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">

                                     's amendment is to, after 'enterprises', insert the words 'which are enterprises that are either Australian owned or majority Australian owned'.

                                     As I said before, we are seeing a lot of these companies here in Australia—and I understand they employ a lot of Australian workers—that do not pay tax in Australia. I have a problem with this. A lot of these people come out here, buy up Australian businesses and don't pay their fair share of tax in Australia, which I have been on about since 1996. The government has done a little about addressing that. I think you addressed it and you pulled in an extra $125 million in taxes from foreign companies in Australia. Here we are, expecting the Australian taxpayers to put out $100 million to prop up businesses. One Nation is very supportive of small to medium-sized businesses, and that's why we supported your corporate tax cut—up to $50 million turnover. What I want is an assurance from the government that their moneys will not go to propping up foreign companies that, at the end of the day, do not pay their fair share of tax in this country. That is One Nation's amendment. I want a guarantee from you to the Australian people that these will be Australian owned or majority Australian owned companies that this money is going to. Is it written in the bill?

                                      The objective of the bill is quite explicit in section 3. It says:
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      The object of this Act is to increase investment in small and medium Australian enterprises by the Commonwealth participating in, and investing in (together with other persons), the Australian Business Growth Fund in accordance with this Act.

                                      That is quite explicit. However, I understand your concern. We are working out how to make that more explicit as part of the shareholder agreement, and I think that should be an adequate response.

                                         here. Minister, if you'd been here for the endless debates we had around the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and other international trade agreements, you'd know you'd be in breach of those agreements if you did that and no doubt would attract a state-to-state dispute or an investor-state dispute if you were to give any preferential treatment in the financing of Australian businesses over foreign interests—which, by the way, I voted against because I didn't support this raft of trade deals that actually tied our hands behind our backs in being able to look after Australian businesses. I'd perhaps ask that you go away and consider that, in terms of your response to Senator Hanson.

In both of those countries, the government played a critical role in getting those business growth funds off the ground.

                                                       Minister, for those in the chamber here today who are here to witness the Senate doing its job, which is scrutinising government legislation and holding you to account, I note that you can't even provide some of the most basic information that we need to make a decision to pass this legislation today. You can't even, for example, tell us how many

                                                       s weren't able to access capital that's required to, for example, expand their businesses. You've said that there's a need for patient equity or patient investment in SMEs, yet we don't even know how many SMEs have been asking for that patient investment. I understand if you don't have the information. You can choose not to answer the question, or you can just stand up and say, 'Senator, we haven't assessed what the market failure that we're trying to address here actually is.' But I think you've got to be honest, and fundamentally honest, with the Senate about this. We are about to give $100 million of taxpayers' money at a time when your government is riddled with scandals from pork-barrelling—using public funds for your own personal and electoral benefit. You're about to take $100 million of taxpayers' funds and put it into a private equity fund that will have enormous power in this country. It is essentially going to be run by the big banks at a time when we have worked as a chamber over many years to breakdown the power of the banks and the concentration of the banks in Australia. Why give them a leg-up, by essentially giving them control of an enormously influential private equity fund in the area of small and medium enterprise financing?

They will not be able to compete. They are providing capital to hundreds, if not thousands, of small businesses already, and successfully providing capital. They have rung the loudest alarm bell you could possibly ring about your fund.

                                                       We all know in here why this is happening, because this government made an election promise that they would put in place a business growth fund. The amendment we have before us today from Senator Patrick is a very sensible amendment. When I first heard about this—it's been very rushed; I didn't know anything about it—my immediate assumption was that the
                                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">

My immediate assumption would be this would a lender of last resort facility for those SMEs and others who couldn't access finance. My second thought was they'd be very high risk. They'd be very high risk SMEs if everyone else had knocked them back. But there are valid reasons why some Australian businesses won't get finance in a tough environment. And, yes, it's true, APRA, ASIC and others have been a lot tougher, as they need to be for our systemic market risk. Why are we not considering, as a chamber, Senator Patrick's amendment that would at least make this fund provide finance, or be in a position to potentially provide finance, and funding as an underwriter to those SMEs that can't access finance? Where's the information on where that market failure is?

                                                       The numbers we've seeing here are that up to 30 per cent of SMEs—the best small and medium enterprises, the ones with the best balance sheets and the best investment propositions—are going to be cherrypicked by this bank-funded, massive private equity fund of enormous influence. The benefits of that are going to flow straight back to the big banks. It'll give them more money and more power and the SMEs that actually really need the funds aren't going to get anything. Those investors out there at the moment—be they the concerns of the Australian Shareholders' Association, be they stockbroking companies—those that provide private equity are going to get left with the SMEs that are the highest risk and potentially lowest return, while this massive private equity fund, that we're essentially giving to the banks through your initiative, is going to cream the profit off the top, to use the name for Senator Patrick's dissenting report. It doesn't make sense. Minister, you have a background in finance. I know you understand this stuff better than most people in this place so I know that you can answer these questions.

                                                       I wanted to clearly put it on record today that you can't tell us how many SMEs have even applied for funding. You can't tell us how many have been knocked back from funding, be it a debt funding stream, be it a private equity funding stream, be it an IPO stream through initial public offerings on the share market. We don't know what benefits the UK

We have never really got a response from your government and Treasury as to why banks only put aside 25c in the dollar. Why is the very sensible proposal to make the Business Growth Fund an underwriting fund not being considered, rather than this flawed current proposal? It's also not being considered by the Labor Party either. I'm very surprised about that after what we've been through. I don't think we would have seen the Labor Party supporting it and giving the big banks more power and more money in the last parliament.

                                                       I'm very troubled by the idea that Labor will support this proposal today. This is a proposal to give it to the big banks and many of them are reluctant. It has been reported in a number of media articles that at least three of the big banks are reluctantly participating. We've heard from the minister today that they're still working through the details with those big banks. They're not quite sure exactly what that participation is going to look like. Minister, have you had personal conversations with those banks about their doubts and will you be able to provide the chamber today some background as to why even some of the banks that we're giving more money to—and the Australian public are giving another leg up to—have concerns over this fund?

Indeed, how much do you anticipate this will cost on an annual basis?

What deal has been done with the government? What are they going to get in return for their money? It doesn't state here what the rate of return is, so I'd like to know why banks are getting involved in this with the government to prop up businesses in the country, when, if a business goes to them, they are reluctant to loan them the money.
