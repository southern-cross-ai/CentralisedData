        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR" rel="nofollow">

        Nicholls Society in which he begged forgiveness that the Howard government’s extreme industrial relations changes did not go far enough? Is it not the case that the industrial relations changes, which take effect today, have already removed protection from unfair dismissal and crushed Australian workers’ ability to bargain for better pay and conditions? Given his recent comments, can the minister now explain how much further he wants to go? Which of the few remaining rights does the minister now want to strip off Australian workers?

         I thank Senator Wong for her question. Indeed I do recall having a very convivial evening with my friends at the

         is well known for its long campaign to reform Australia’s industrial relations system to give workers more choice and more freedom in the workplace and to advance the cause of ordinary Australian workers by removing the shackles of the outdated, antiquated and old regulated industrial system that we inherited from the Labor Party.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indeed, our focus on this issue is a reflection of the fact that on this side of the chamber we are focused on policies that seek to advance the interests of ordinary working Australians. I point to the extraordinary improvement in real wages that has occurred under this government: a substantial improvement in real wages for ordinary Australians under the policies put into place by this government and against the opposition of the Labor Party. There was no improvement in real wages whatsoever under the Labor Party, because of its antiquated approach to this issue of industrial relations—a most important issue in terms of Australia preparing itself for the 21st century to ensure that we can maintain a strong economy able to sustain high growth, high jobs, low unemployment and increasing real wages. So we make no apology for the very sensible reforms which begin today and which herald a new era of economic reform for this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think it is a signal of how moderate our changes are that the HR Nicholls Society and others think that we should have gone further. We have not gone as far as they and others think we should. We think our proposals, and the package that comes into force today, are very moderate and reasonable and take account of the fair interests of all workers but ensure that they can have choice in the workplace that will enable them to improve their wages and working conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Labor Party has to understand, like Mr Blair understands, that this is a whole new world. It is an extraordinary fact that when these changes take full effect Australia will still have a more regulated workplace than either Mr Blair’s United Kingdom or

         </a>
         . Both of those leaders, Labour prime ministers, were sensible enough when they came into office not to roll back the reforms made to their industrial relations arrangements by their Conservative and National predecessors respectively. They, as enlightened Labour leaders, recognised the virtues of the changes brought in by their conservative predecessors. The changes that they made, and which those Labour leaders have kept, have ensured that New Zealand and the United Kingdom have enjoyed sustained high growth and high living standards. This government is committed to ensuring that this country continues to have high living standards for Australians. We are very proud of the changes that come into place today.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I again refer the minister to his speech in which he indicated the need for another wave of industrial relations reform. Can the minister indicate which of the few remaining rights of Australian employees not removed by the government’s current extreme industrial relations laws he proposes to target in the future? Will it be sick leave, minimum wage, annual leave, hours of work or parental leave? How many more Australian workers, in addition to the four million who have lost their unfair dismissal rights today, will have their right to challenge an unfair dismissal removed in the future? Minister, are there any rights for Australian workers that the Howard government is not prepared to destroy?

           We do have in progress preparation for the introduction of legislation to protect independent contractors from the ravages of the trade union movement, and we will proceed with that. It is an amazing fact that there are now more independent contractors in this country than there are union members, and the Labor Party ought to wake up to the changes going on in the workplace. We will proceed with that legislation, but the Prime Minister has made it clear that we will not be taking any further major changes to the next election.
