        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Smith. On Saturday I was very pleased to announce the Turnbull government's comprehensive and holistic media reform package. It aims very deliberately to support the viability and the longevity of Australian media. I am sure I speak on behalf of every colleague in this place when I say that we might not always like what those in the media might write, print, broadcast, stream or post about any of us here, but we all recognise the important role that the Australian media plays in underpinning our democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a package which is unabashedly pro Australian media. It is pro journalism, it is for Australian stories and it is for Australian voices. Notably, the package has the unanimous support of the Australian media industry—we are talking channels Nine, Seven, Ten,

          ASTRA
         </a>
         . I think those who have worked in this area know that getting that degree of unanimity is something that is very rare indeed in this industry, and I commend those in the sector who have looked beyond their own legitimate organisational interests to the broader interests of the media sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         As colleagues would be aware, we are going to abolish broadcast licence fees, which are from a bygone era, and put in their place a more modest spectrum charge. The good news is that this provides the opportunity for a community dividend in the form of further restrictions on gambling advertising across all platforms, which we will be aiming to have in place by March next year.

               who, when we put the 75 per cent and two-out-of-three rule legislation to the parliament, referred it off to Senate committee for many months. We then had the election and introduced it again, and they then again referred it off to Senate committee for many months, saying it was piecemeal. What we are putting forward here is a very broad package, and guess what Labor are saying now? They are saying that what we are putting forward as a government is just housekeeping. What we were putting forward before, apparently, was piecemeal, and this—which is comprehensive—they are now saying is housekeeping. I think it is time to put aside the arguments of the past and support Australian media.
