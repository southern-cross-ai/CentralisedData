        , Senator Ruston. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Morrison government is informing families at risk of violence about the support services that are available, especially during these difficult times resulting from COVID-19?

         I thank Senator Henderson for her question and her ongoing interest in making sure that we have the settings right to try and prevent domestic violence from happening before it even starts. The national campaign Help is Here is a campaign that we launched in May this year. It's funded through the $150 million domestic violence package that was announced. This extra funding is absolutely directed at making sure that anybody who might be at risk of domestic violence knows what support is available to them and where they are able to get those services.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Help" rel="nofollow">
          The Help
         </a>
         is Here campaign reaches Australians in a number of different ways: through the internet and, obviously, in their homes on the television, but most importantly in shopping centres and in magazines and newspapers, where people who may be at greater risk are often by themselves. The two main contact points are through the 1800RESPECT hotline and the dedicated MensLine.
        </p>
        <p>
         The campaign uniquely reflects the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic by recognising that, during the pandemic, some people at risk of domestic violence may not be able to leave their house, apart from perhaps to go shopping. The Help is Here campaign aims to reach victims of domestic violence and abuse through signs in rest rooms in shopping centres, to make sure that they know where they can ring if they need to get some help or if they are finding themselves in difficult times. By directing people to the national hotlines and through the partnership networks that we have, we provide assistance 24 hours a day, seven days a week so people can know that they can go online or onto the phone and speak to a trained counsellor from the particular initiatives that are being funded.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also want to thank the private sector for coming on board with this particular initiative, the Help is Here campaign: Channel 7 and the major supermarket chains, as well as Amazon. I also acknowledge the work of the states and territories, to which we've provided $130 million to support them in their frontline service provision.

           </small>
           <p>
            I'm really pleased to say that the evaluation research results have shown that more than half of Australians, when surveyed, had recognised and remembered the campaign and acknowledged that they had seen it. That is really important, because increased awareness means that people will know automatically where they can get the support should they find themselves in need of it. As an example, in the middle of this year the 1800RESPECT hotline had received 86,000 contacts in the three-month period leading up to 30 July 2020. At the same time last year, they'd received around 55,000 calls in the same periodâ€”a significant increase. MensLine also indicated that they had received an increase in calls.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know that more Australians know there is support out there, and that is a good thing, because we want them to know that they are not alone and the support services are there for them if they find themselves in a situation of needing them. I would encourage anybody who finds themselves in a difficult situation to reach out to one of these two hotlines for support.

               This campaign has targeted everybody who is in Australia. We want to try and reach them by as many different means as possibleâ€”whether it be through the internet, through normal channels like television and radio, in shopping centres or through magazines and newspapersâ€”because we want them to know that the two national hotlines are available to them. Most importantlyâ€”to make sure we reach out to people who don't speak English as their first language and to our

               â€”we want to make sure that our advice is provided in an appropriate way. So, for our vulnerable communities, the campaign materials have been tailored. For instance, in

               communities we've translated our advertising materials into 14 different languages so that the audiences will be able to get access to the Help is Here information. We've also worked with Indigenous mentors and Indigenous domestic violence survivors to prepare for distribution appropriate material for news outlets and, specifically, the channels of distribution that they're most likely to use.
