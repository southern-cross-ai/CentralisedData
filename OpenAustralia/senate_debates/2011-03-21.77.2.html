        Appropriations proposed in the bills provide funding for expenditure that is required to implement decisions and funding adjustments, that involve further expenditure in 2010-11, which have been agreed since the 2010-11 Budget. Passage of the bills before the last day of the 2011 Autumn Sittings will ensure continuity of the Government's programs and the Commonwealth's ability to meet its obligations as they fall due. Should passage not be granted in the 2011 Autumn Sittings, activities to be funded by the bills may be deferred or significantly delayed.

       <p class="italic">
        The Centrelink annual payment cycle for families' entitlements commences on 1 July each financial year and so enacting fortnightly payments from the first week after 1 July 2011 is essential for ease of administration for families, child care services and Centrelink. Passage of the bill in the 2011 Autumn sittings will ensure that the July 2011 commencement date can be met.

In order to meet this start date it is important that the package of bills to establish the NVR and ensure that the new regulatory framework interacts properly with other regulatory frameworks and funding programs is passed during the Autumn sittings.

         Western Australia

        have indicated they will enact mirroring legislation. The territories also support this proposal. Finalisation of the bills in the Autumn sittings is important as it will facilitate states and territories to make their own legislative arrangements to support the establishment of the NVR.

        The bills establish a number of statutory officers and until the legislation passes and the commencement of the NVR is assured, it will not be possible to recruit senior officers.

        </a>
        it is important that detailed transition plans are developed to cover matters including the transfer of staff from state and territory regulators to the NVR and new arrangements for the regulation of RTOs. However, it is difficult to progress these discussions until the bills have been passed and a start date for the NVR confirmed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NVR and its strengthened monitoring and enforcement powers are integral to the Government's response to the weaknesses that have been identified in regulation under both the Australian Qualifications and Training Framework and the regulatory framework for international education.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NVR also requires a number of legislative instruments in order to be fully operational. These legislative instruments cannot be laid before the Parliament until after the bills have passed.
