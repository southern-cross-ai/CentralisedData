           The government does not support this motion, which is nothing but a continuation of the attacks against the former Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. The government made a claim of public interest immunity covering matters related to legal advice concerning the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
            CFMEU
           </a>
           's court proceedings against the former commissioner on 15 February which was accepted by the Senate's Education and Employment Legislation Committee. Governments of both persuasions have not made such information publicly available as it is important that governments have access to frank and honest legal advice.

              Whilst I'm not indicating anything in relation to the motives of the opposition, I read from a judicial statement:

             <p class="italic">
              â€¦ in performing its accountability function, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council" rel="nofollow">
               Legislative Council
              </a>
              may require access to legal advice on the basis of which the Executive acted, or purported to act, as access to such advice might well be relevant in order to make an informed assessment of the justification for the Executive decision. That access was reasonably necessary for the exercise by the Legislative Council of its functions. What, if any, access should in fact occur was a matter "of the occasion and of the manner" of the exercise of a power, and not of the existence of the power.
