           Thank you. The Ministerial Drug and Alcohol Forum is currently developing a national foetal alcohol spectrum disorder strategic action plan through the guidance of the national drug strategy committee. The plan is intended to provide a cohesive evidence based approach to strengthen Australia's efforts in preventing and diagnosing the disorder and better supporting those living with and affected by the disorder. It is expected that the plan will be finalised by the end of the year. The Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation is currently considering implementing mandatory pregnancy warning labels on alcoholic beverages. Targeted consultation concluded on 14 June, and analysis of submissions is currently underway. A final decision on mandating pregnancy warning labels is likely to occur during an out-of-session meeting of the forum later in the year.
