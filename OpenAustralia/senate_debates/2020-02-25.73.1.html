         I thank Senator Rennick for the question, and I acknowledge that he comes, like I do, from one of the great states that understands the benefits that the resources sector makes to its economy but also understands that as a government we have to continue to put in place policies that will ensure the future of the resources sector in Australia. When we have a strong resources sector, the economy prospers and grows, and we see the creation of more jobs for Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of job creation, since we were elected to office in 2013 the policies that the coalition government has put in place have seen the economy create now in excess of 1.5 million jobs. In fact, with the recent labour force figures for January 2020, employment has increased by almost 250,000 jobs, and that continues to be above the decade average for jobs growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've also made a commitment that we will put in place the right policies that will enable the economy to create an additional 1.25 million jobs over the next five years. To achieve this, we understand that we in Australia need a strong resources sector and we need to ensure that Australians have the necessary skills that our resources sector needs. That is why, through the government's $585 million investment in our skills package, we've announced a skills organisation pilot in the resources industry and, in particular, the mining industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mining industry, as we know, is strongly engaged with the

         system. The mining industry invests heavily in its workforce and in the training of its workforce to ensure that they have the necessary skills. We are committed to working with the resources industry to ensure that they continue to deliver and we as a government continue to deliver to Australians the right skills—

            It's because the resources industry in Australia makes such a great contribution to the Australian economy. We as Australians rely on a strong and growing mining industry that is highly reliant on a skilled, mobile and diverse workforce. In terms of the statistics, the resources sector accounted for eight per cent of Australia's
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
             GDP
            </a>
            and 59 per cent of Australia's export earnings in 2018-19. That is something that the coalition government respects. The sector employed nearly 245,000 Australians at the end of 2018-19. That's around two per cent of Australia's total workforce. Also, though, as a sector, it is one of the fastest growing employers in the Australian economy, with employment rising from 94,000 just 15 years ago. That's why we—

                I have to say that there are some on the other side who have done something 'vaguely competent'—to take the interjection from the senator—and they are the Otis group, who expressed confidence in the resources sector of this country but were shouted down by those at the top. They are a group of Labor senators who raised what we believe is actually a valid point and expressed support for the resources industry and its job-creating prospects. They were not just shouted down by the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the Labor Party; on top of that, they were then insulted by the policy Labor brought out in relation to net zero emissions for everything by 2050. That is a job-destroying policy. So, for those on the Labor side who do support growing the resources industry, I look forward to watching you—
