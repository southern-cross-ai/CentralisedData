         I have a few more questions to ask, but I want to go back to the veterans mental health inquiry where, very recently, we put a number of questions on notice in reference to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report published on 17 March 2016 concerning the mental health of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         members and veterans. We asked the minister if he could advise which of a number of recommendations had been actioned, or when they would be actioned. If they were not to be actioned, we asked why not. There were 17 questions that we put on notice, and this is the answer that we got back: '
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          The Senate
         </a>
         inquiry report presented the government with 25 recommendations comprising 17 main recommendations and eight minority report recommendations. Of the 17 main recommendations, three were agreed to by the government, four were agreed to in principle, six were partly agreed and four were noted. The government did not rate any of the main recommendations as not agreed. Of the eight minority report recommendations, one was agreed to by the government, one was partly agreed, two were noted and four were not agreed.'
        </p>
        <p>
         What they didn't say is that not one of those things has been put into place. So, nearly 16 months later, nothing that was recommended by that committee to start helping those veterans with their mental health has been done. That is shameful in itself. I simply say this: if the government's intention in introducing the DRCA bill is to streamline veterans legislation—if that is what they believe it will do—are they prepared to make a commitment to adopting the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's recommendation in the veterans suicide report for a

          As I said last night, senators have put a lot of time and effort into preparing the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, and it's only appropriate that the government make a considered response to reflect that. In relation to the senator's earlier comments, that is within the remit of the Minister for Health.

            Senator Lambie, based on my experience, you can ask questions, and if any senator chooses to rise in response to those questions it is entirely in order. However, they don't have to.

               Labor stated that my amendments for arranging quick rehabilitation might conflict with another section of DRCA relating to rehabilitation. If that is truly the case, wouldn't it be prudent to amend that other section to include arranging timely or quick rehabilitation in this DRCA bill so that veterans may recover faster through the arrangement of quicker rehabilitation?

                I rise to outline the Nick Xenophon's Team's position in relation to Senator Lambie's amendments. At the outset I would like to emphasise our acknowledgement of the place of deep concern from which Senator Lambie's amendments arise. I understand she is seeking to incorporate into the DRCA a section in relation to emphasising that, in order to minimise the duration and severity of injuries to a veteran or a Defence personnel member, rehabilitation should be arranged quickly. We acknowledge this. We have received advice from the government and also from the opposition that, while these amendments have come from good intentions, they may in fact have some unintended consequences for those veterans. That is why, although we strongly support Senator Lambie and we strongly support the principle of allowing veterans and Defence personnel access to timely rehabilitation, we are uneasy about supporting these amendments.

                     Certainly. The primary focus of rehabilitation under Comcare is to arrange an employee's return to work as quickly as possible after a work-related injury or disease. While the arrangements include restoring the individual's social as well as vocational status, this is considered within an employee's workplace setting. As former members of the ADF,
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
                      DVA
                     </a>
                     clients often have different needs from the typical Comcare rehabilitation client who is returning to work. Their ADF employment not only gave them an income and meaningful work, it also provided housing, health care, recreational facilities, social networks, training, and a structured career path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The impact of military life means the families of DVA clients also have complex needs. A DVA client's rehabilitation plan also addresses the family's requirements, in addition to the client's needs. For all these reasons, and others, there's a belief in the government that the treatment of ADF members using guidelines designed for public servants is not desirable.

                      Minister, I might try to summarise what you just said to ensure that I understand it properly. It is that an unintended consequence of inserting this provision could be to force somebody into rehabilitation for the purposes of returning them to work, when in fact returning them to work may not be in the best interest of the veteran or the member of the Defence Force, and they need a more holistic approach to their rehabilitation?

                        Is the government able to provide any assurances today that veterans will receive the arrangement of timely rehabilitation in this new DRCA bill, given the blow-out times in which determinations of certain claims are made under SRCA—I note that in his recent ministerial statement Minister Tehan said that permanent impairment determinations on claims under SRCA increased from 112 days to 148 days, an increase of 36 days?

                           The foreign affairs, defence and trade committee recommended that the Productivity Commission review Australia's complex veterans legislation. So why has the government brought the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Defence Force) Bill 2017 on for consideration before the review could even be conducted—or you people taking 90 days to even decide whether you're going to conduct that? That would be the best way forward.

                            I seek to give the Labor Party's response to Senator Lambie's amendment 8101, known as the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII" rel="nofollow">
                             Henry VIII
                            </a>
                            motion. Unfortunately, Labor will not be supporting this amendment, as the Henry VIII clause is intended only as a fail-safe in the unlikely event that something else has been overlooked in the drafting of the bill which would leave veterans worse off. Henry VIII clauses enable the government to make regulations with the power to modify the act, which are then introduced to parliament as a disallowable instrument. In the DRCA, a condition has been added to the Henry VIII clause that requires any regulations made under this provision to act in a purely beneficial way for the veteran to deal with any anomalies that may arise where there is a retrospective application of the DRCA. This condition states:
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            Before the Governor-General makes regulations under subsection 1:
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            a. the Minister must be satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to make the regulations to ensure that no person (except the Commonwealth) is disadvantaged by the enactment of this Act;
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            As such, it is clear that, in the event of this clause being utilised, it can only be when someone has been made worse off by the creation of the DRCA and any changes will benefit only an individual claimant and not the government. This is a very important condition, and it is the reason the Labor Party is in a position to support the inclusion of this clause.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            It's worth remembering that in the event that the clause is utilised there would be an individual veteran who has been made worse off for the creation of this bill and has had this acknowledgement by the department and regulations drafted, approved and tabled. To deny or delay them the provision of receiving this benefit is unfair, particularly given that, in these circumstances, if the DRCA had not been created there would have been no delay and they would have received this assistance immediately. We call on the department to, in the event that this clause is utilised, exhaust all avenues to ensure that anyone else who would benefit from the changes to the regulations is afforded the same benefit. The government has agreed to this at Labor's request and has committed to ensuring that everything possibly will be done by the department to locate and contact any person who would be affected by the DRCA Henry VIII clause. Labor supports the inclusion of this clause without the requirement to consult prior to making the regulations, for one reason only, and that is to ensure that that there is no delay in correcting the issue which has come about due to the creation of the bill and its impact on the veteran.

I could go through them if you want, but we won't do that. But both the major parties are just as much to blame here. What you do is simply say, 'Oh well, okay. Too bad,' but you don't go in and fix it, even though there are unintended consequences because of it. So I simply want to know this: do you have an action plan for the

                                clause is to ensure that there is a safety net for veterans in case a person does suffer detriment due to the DRCA's enactment. Without a Henry VIII clause, it would take a much longer time to remedy any detriments suffered by the veteran, as it would require an amendment to the principal act. Every effort has been made by the government to ensure that ADF members are not disadvantaged by the DRCA's commencement. However, in the unlikely case where it comes to light that a person is unintentionally disadvantaged by the DRCA's enactment, a Henry VIII clause would enable the minister to override the DRCA where a case of disadvantage came to his or her attention. This would allow the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to quickly address any disadvantage suffered by the veteran. Regulations can be quickly enacted to fix the disadvantage, and regulations are flexible because they allow the minister to address both individual and group needs.

                                   Once again, the Nick Xenophon Team acknowledges the place of deep concern that Senator Lambie's amendment has come from. Indeed, I think it's reflective of, sadly, the state of deep suspicion and distrust amongst the veterans community for the

                                    Very simply, actually, it would take longer to remedy any detriments suffered by a veteran because it would require an amendment to the principal act. So it is our advice, if there are disadvantages that come to light, that the quickest and most effective way to remedy that disadvantage is through this

                                     Just finally, I noted, Minister, that in some of your remarks last night you mentioned that the government would be looking to conduct a review of any legislative instrument made following or utilising the

If, for example, a regulation is tabled as a result of the Henry VIII clause, will the government conduct a review of how that regulation actually plays out for the veteran or veterans?
