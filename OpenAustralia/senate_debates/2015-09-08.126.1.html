        I rise to speak on an issue of critical importance today: the safety and wellbeing of children across this country. This week is National Child Protection Week in Australia. In its 25th year, National Child Protection Week is a reminder to all Australians that 'Protecting children is everyone's business'. We all have a part to play in promoting and protecting the safety and wellbeing of children and young people. This is not a role that can be left to child protection workers, police and teachers. We must work to empower all families and all communities to play their part. The evidence shows that there is much for us to be doing. As the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare publication
        <i>
         Australia's welfare 2015
        </i>
        notes, more children are now receiving child protection services. In 2013-14 about 143,000 Australian children aged zero to 17 received child protection services, compared with 135,000 in 2012-13. In 2013-14 this was one in every 37 children. Of these children, about 123,000 were aged zero to 14.

        </a>
        , the national coordinator of National Child Protection Week, aims to raise public awareness of child abuse and neglect and its impacts. NAPCAN also works to provide individuals and communities with the information and resources they need to take action. Each of us in this place would be well aware of the consequences of people not playing their part—what happens when people do not take action. We have all read tragic stories of children harmed or even killed by people who were meant to love them and care for them. We have all seen the heartbreaking cases of children harmed or killed when the system breaks down—when the system fails them. This is not an issue limited to one state or to one community; this is an issue that touches families and children across this entire country. However, we do know that there are barriers and parental problems, such as substance misuse, mental illness and family or domestic violence, which result in negative outcomes for children. But we also know that there are amazing individuals and organisations working in communities across the country to provide innovative programs to support families and children.
       </p>
       <p>
        In National Child Protection Week the work of some of these organisations is recognised through the NAPCAN
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_Your_Part" rel="nofollow">
         Play Your Part
        </a>
        awards. The Play Your Part awards recognise individuals, communities and organisations that have played their part to prevent child abuse and neglect. Today NAPCAN recognised six Tasmanian organisations for their efforts in child abuse prevention.

        , Good Beginnings, Hobart City Mission, Baptcare, Pittwater Community Centre and the Jordan River Services were acknowledged for their integrated family support service alliance. The south-west region integrated family support service provided by this alliance focuses on increasing the wellbeing and safety of children, young people and families by providing support and resources to build family strength, resilience and capacity. These organisations provide a comprehensive range of case management services for children, young people and families which are flexible to the needs of each family. This can include anything from practical parenting skills and time management skills to supports to deal with the impact of mental health issues or substance abuse. This kind of collaborative approach is critical to achieving good outcomes for vulnerable and at-risk families and children. I commend these organisations and their hardworking staff and volunteers for the incredible work that they do in these communities in Tasmania. I also commend the other recipients of the Play Your Part awards. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the Parliamentarians Against Child Abuse and Neglect, particularly the convenors, Senator Catryna Bilyk and Mr Ken Wyatt.
       </p>
       <p>
        All governments, businesses, not-for-profit organisations, communities, families and individuals have a role to play in keeping children safe and well. This is a job that is simply too important for us to fail at. We cannot continue to fail Australia's children. We cannot let them slip through the gaps. We cannot let them fall prey to poor systems and communication. We cannot walk by. We must take action.
