       <p class="italic">
        (i) the management of transport security is critical to our national security and to regional communities in

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) on 8 May 2018, the Morrison Government announced measures to "further strengthen Australia's domestic and international aviation security", which included the introduction of body scanners and improved luggage screening technology at airports,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) regional airlines and airports in South Australia have expressed concern that the cost of these upgrades will make regional airline services economically unviable,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee began public hearings into this matter on 7 May 2020,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) the Committee heard evidence that

       </p>

        (B) Whyalla City Council is concerned that an increase in security costs may result in one of the two major airlines that use the airport exit the market, impacting the local economy, and

         Regional Express Airlines
        </a>
        said that the airline's profit margin is approximately $10 per passenger, and if the airline was required to pay security costs, they would no longer make a profit,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) at the hearing, Senator Rennick stated that "We're not talking about airports, we're talking about national security, right. And, you know, something that we've got to get sorted out here, because we just had it with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Princess" rel="nofollow">
         Ruby Princess
        </a>
        . Okay, and I'm a member of the federal government, and it's our job to look after national security. So this sort of pushing it out on the private enterprise or rather sort of smaller, it just leads to confusion and ambiguous responsibilities as to who's responsible for what. So I think that we ought to take a good look at whether or not it's better for us to do a holistic national approach, rather than the piecemeal airport by airport, which is going to hurt a lot of airports in the region. And I think before, you know, any more changes in regulations or decisions are made, that we look at a national approach. Because if it's good enough for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

        and

        , I think it's something that we should also take a serious look at, I'll just leave it at that. Thanks."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vii) Senator Rennick is correct in saying that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (A) the Morrison Government is responsible for national security at our airports and seaports,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (B) the Morrison Government's current approach to national security has led to "confusion and ambiguous responsibilities as to who's responsible for what", and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (C) the Morrison Government's approach to regional aviation security will potentially "hurt a lot of airports in the region";
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) commends the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for its' ongoing work in this area, and its long-standing history of representing rural and regional Australians on important policy issues; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) condemns the Morrison Government for its implementation of airport security upgrades to date, which are causing confusion and leading to the potential loss of airports, airline services, and jobs in regional South Australia.

              Keeping Australian communities safe from those who seek to do us harm will continue to be the Morrison government's No. 1 priority. The Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Security Controlled Airports) Regulation delivers on recommendations of the Inspector of Transport Security to strengthen security at Australia's airports and particularly those serving rural and regional communities. Regional airports are being supported through the government's $50.1 million Regional Airport Security Screening Fund. The government has announced more than $1.2 billion in funding to support the aviation industry, including keeping regional communities connected, since 18 March 2020. These enhancements to regional aviation security and our commitment to funding to regional airlines and airports underscores the government's commitment to supporting regional communities and the aviation networks upon which they depend.

                 Labor's motion is just a smokescreen to distract people from understanding that Labor have rolled over to Minister Dutton in not supporting my motion to disallow the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (Security Controlled Airports) Regulation. Disallowance would force the government to address the disastrous cost its new security regime will impose on small regional airports to the detriment of regional communities. Senator Keneally doesn't like Mr Dutton, but it's clear she and her Labor colleagues are scared of him. They're scared that he'll portray them as weak on national security issues. If they were to have some courage and were committed to both security and regional Australia, Labor would help to force the minister's hand so that we can get sensible cost-sharing arrangements in place. They're all bark and not a lot of bite.
