           The government doesn't see the need for another select committee to be established when there are other committees already capable of examining these matters. In relation to the proposed terms of reference, while 98 Commonwealth agencies are non-corporate, 71 are established as corporate entities and another 18 as Commonwealth companies. The scope of the proposed inquiry is excessively broad insofar as it looks at corporatised entities, potentially covering around half of all agencies, depending on how this is interpreted. The proposed inquiry could be better focused on particular services of government or better define the scope of corporatisation.
