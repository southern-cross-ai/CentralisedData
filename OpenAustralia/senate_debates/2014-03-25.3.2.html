        That the Committee does not insist on amendments 5 and 41 to which the House has disagreed and agrees to the amendments made by the House in their place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The House of Representatives has agreed to 46 of the 48 amendments made to this legislation by the Senate. The two that were opposed both related to paid parental leave in schedule 7. The original schedule 7 was intended to remove the requirement for all employers to act as the pay clerk for the government's Paid Parental Leave Scheme. In passing the original schedule 7, the House of Representatives demonstrated its commitment to removing this administrative burden for all businesses from 1 July 2014. The Senate's revised schedule 7 would have removed that requirement only for employers with fewer than 20 employees. In opposing these amendments, the House of Representatives agreed to its own amendment that would omit schedule 7 of the bill relating to paid parental leave and make a consequential amendment to the commencement provision in the bill. This measure has since been introduced into the House of Representatives in a separate bill, the Paid Parental Leave Amendment Bill 2014.

         The opposition will be supporting the amendment put forward by the government. We maintain our position on the issues around parental leave, and that debate will now occur under legislation brought forward by the government. In that case, we are supporting the amendment before the chair.

          likewise will be supporting this amendment, given that the schedule has been extracted and put into a separate bill. We will have that debate at that time. Having said that, we still do not support many of the schedules, but we see what the government has done with this particular amendment. We will have that debate on the
