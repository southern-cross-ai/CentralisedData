               My second point goes to relevance. The question very clearly was: is the government aware that Papua
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
                New Guinea
               </a>
               is intending to forcibly deport 60 people who sought asylum from Australia, and what representations, if any, has the government made? I am not interested in a homily from Senator Brandis that misleads the Senate on the facts of the matter.

                I did hear the Attorney-General indicate that he was not aware of the comments raised, and that was partly in relation to your preamble. The minister still has one minute and 20 seconds in which to answer the question. The minister is aware of the question.

Whatever protection obligations may attach to the government of New Guinea are protection obligations that attach to people either who have been assessed to be refugees or whose claim to be assessed as refugees is underway. I am advised that these 60 people are people whose claim to be refugees has been rejected by the appropriate authorities.

                   In fairness to Senator McKim, Senator Macdonald, he did say asylum seekers. But he did not disclose in his question that these people are people whose claim to be refugees has been rejected. In those circumstances, under international law and under the refugee convention, the country to whom they make application for asylum has every right to return them to the country of their citizenship.

I know the Attorney has resumed his seat, but with regard to relevance the question was specifically whether the Australian government supports forced deportations prior to detainees being given the chance to exhaust all legal avenues.

                            (   First of all, Senator McKim, the Australian government does not conduct the camp on
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
                             Manus Island
                            </a>
                            ; it is conducted by the government of
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
                             New Guinea
                            </a>
                            . Secondly, the arrangements for the establishment of the camp on Manus Island were created not by the government in which I serve, but by the government of Mr Kevin Rudd.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Thirdly, as I tried to point out to you in my answer to your primary question, this government has been working to secure a more favourable outcome for the people on Manus Island, in particular by negotiating an agreement with the government of the United States which currently is being executed. That agreement with the Obama administration, which was the subject of much talk last week after the telephone conversation between Prime Minister Turnbull and President Trump, has been affirmed by President Trump, the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State" rel="nofollow">

                            and by President Trump's spokesman. So that is what the Australian government is doing to clean up another Labor mess.
