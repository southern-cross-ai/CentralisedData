        I seek leave to make a statement to update the Senate on the missing aircraft in

        Leave granted.

       <p>
        I thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I thank the Senate. I regret to inform the Senate that a PNG Police Search and Rescue reconnaissance helicopter has located the crash site of the wreckage of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Otter" rel="nofollow">
         Twin Otter
        </a>
        aircraft with Air PNG colours. The location is just north of the village of Isurava and it is at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The PNG Police landed their helicopter below the crash site. This group of PNG Police will attempt to reach the crash site on foot. It is important for us to understand of course that the terrain presents obvious difficulties of access. I can inform the Senate that the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Smith
        </a>
        , has advised me that consular officers have contacted all of the families of the Australians on the flight to advise them that a crash site has been located.
       </p>
       <p>
        A range of efforts is being undertaken by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        to assist PNG authorities with this search and rescue operation. I do stress that it is important to remember that this is extremely dense and rugged terrain. Weather conditions today are cloudy with isolated light showers, but the weather is closing in and it is quite possible that it will hamper air efforts after midday.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian High Commission

        in Port Moresby. Flying time to the site is approximately 30 minutes.

        will attempt to land near the site but this will depend, as I have mentioned, on terrain and weather conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        An ADF Caribou aircraft with additional PNG search and rescue personnel and the deputy head of mission from the Australian high commission will depart Port Moresby at 11 am for a 30- to 45-minute flight to Kokoda village. That village, I understand, is approximately a three-hour walk from the crash site.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, to these ADF assets, other assets will be arriving in PNG as part of Defenceâ€™s Operation Kokoda Assist. A

        Base Richmond for Port Moresby this morning. It includes an aeromedical evacuation team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, two Army Blackhawk helicopters from the Sydney area are being prepared for movement today by

        . They are expected to depart Richmond a little later today. An Australian maritime search and rescue Dornier 328 aircraft conducted an initial search last night, and it is further assisting with search and rescue efforts today. As I indicated last night to the Senate, the ADF remains ready to provide further assistance should it be required and of course for as long as is necessary. I can also assure the Senate that we are continuing to coordinate our activities with the PNG authorities. I can assure the Senate we are doing everything possible to locate our fellow countrymen who were on their way to walk the
