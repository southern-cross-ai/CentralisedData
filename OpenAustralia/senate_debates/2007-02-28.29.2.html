        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . Is the minister aware of the former environment minister’s proposed national code for wind farms? In pushing for the code, didn’t the minister say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To help overcome this problem, it is vital that we make every effort to ensure majority community endorsement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Didn’t the former minister advocate involving local communities in decision making for approving wind farms, particularly given the impact on property values? Will the current environment minister now follow the lead of his predecessor and propose a national code for nuclear reactors to ensure communities have a say in decision making and that no reactors are built unless they have majority community support? Or does the government only require renewable energy projects like wind farms to attract majority community support?

         There are a number of issues in that question by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_George_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
          Senator George Campbell
         </a>
         . First of all can I indicate to the honourable senator that in fact the idea of doing community consultation in relation to wind farms, I understand, was first raised by the former Labor member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">
          McMillan
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Zahra" rel="nofollow">
          Christian Zahra
         </a>
         . So before the honourable senator gets too excited about that issue he might like to look to his own troops to see where that idea came from.
        </p>
        <p>
         Having said that, one great thing about this government at all times has been our willingness to consult with the community on the difficult issues of the day. That has been one of the hallmarks of this government. Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
          Ian Campbell
         </a>
         , whilst he was Minister for the Environment and Heritage, did a very good job in consulting with the community. Senator Campbell has now been given the very important task of undertaking human services—he is still within the cabinet—something that millions of Australians are very concerned about. We on this side believe that it was in fact a vote of confidence in Senator Campbell that he should be looking after these millions of Australians, whereas of course Senator Ray thinks anything to do with human services is a belittlement and a degrading of position. But we embrace all those people who rely on the human services portfolio of this country. We are not ashamed of them. We think that is an important role, and that is why it is rightly in cabinet with Senator Campbell representing it.

         turn to the issue of nuclear reactors. Before Senator George Campbell gets too excited about that issue, can I simply remind him that under Australian legislation as it stands at the moment we will not be having nuclear power stations. Therefore—

           Those opposite are just so anxious not to hear the facts or allow the Australian people to hear the facts, because, once they understand the facts, the Labor Party’s scare campaign will fall to pieces—as it did with the

            GST
           </a>

             Mr President
            </a>
            . Given recent comments by a number of coalition MPs, can the minister indicate whether he would support the building of a nuclear reactor in his home state of Tasmania? Given the need to locate a reactor near the sea and existing infrastructure, wouldn’t
