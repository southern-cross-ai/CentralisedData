        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. Is the minister aware of reports of intimidation, threats or harassment of Australian workers and their families by members of registered organisations?

         Unfortunately, I am sickened to advise the Senate that individuals at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         picket line at Oaky North have reached a new level of depravity. Outside Oaky North, in Queensland, last week, we saw reports of CFMEU thugs intimidating workers at Glencore, including threatening to rape the children of these workers. It is quite frankly hard to imagine that anyone, despite the circumstances, could say anything so depraved that they would threaten to rape someone's children, in particular when all these people are trying to do is to go to work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite, unfortunately, colleagues, don't condemn the CFMEU; they just try to justify their behaviour. Let's take, for example, Senator Watt, who proudly boasts that he has been to the picket line and stood beside the same people who have made these threatsâ€”threats to rape someone's children. Then, of course, we witnessed Sally McManus, who dismissed this behaviour as a result of a lack of education. What a snob. She thinks that people who don't have university degrees must therefore behave like animals. Then, of course, we have Labor candidate Ged Kearney, who laid the blame for these vile threats with the employer, saying, 'If there's anyone here to blame, it must be the company.' How can anyone, in any way, try to rationalise or justify threatening to rape someone's children?

            Yes, unfortunately, I am. Given that I'm unable to use the vile language that those on the picket line utilised, I will table a document containing a detailed list of the threats made at the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
             CFMEU
            </a>
            picket line. Despite these threats, and despite the Labor Party knowing about these vile and disgusting threats, the Leader of the Opposition himself, Mr Bill Shorten, travelled thousands of kilometres so he too could stand alongside the picket line. The man who wants to be the Prime Minister stood side by side with people who are making some of the vilest threats I have ever heard. As a leader of a major political party, what message is Mr Shorten sending to those workers who have been subjected to this type of abuse when he stands in solidarity with the abusers?

               Unfortunately, the Labor Party haven't done anythingâ€”just more weasel words. What they need to do is demonstrate real leadership and sever all ties with the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
                CFMEU
               </a>
               . That, of course, means they should stop taking the CFMEU's money. All we have seen to date is weasel words and veiled attempts to excuse this vile behaviourâ€”vile behaviour including threats to rape someone's children. But this record has been played many times before. Too much money is at stake for principles to prevail. The Labor Party has accepted $8 million from the CFMEU in the last five years. But in light of what has been exposed it really does beg the question. If a threat to rape someone's children doesn't mean the Labor Party will sever ties with the CFMEU, what type of behaviour will justify it?
