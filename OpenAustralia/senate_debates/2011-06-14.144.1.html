         The Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In addition to the Project's reporting, EFIC and other Lenders to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG_LNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG LNG
         </a>
         project required the borrower to engage an independent environmental and social consultant (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IESC" rel="nofollow">
          IESC
         </a>
         ). While the IESC, D'Appolonia S.p.A (D'Appolonia) is paid by the borrower, it is solely responsible to the lenders including EFIC. D'Appolonia undertakes site visits to monitor the project's compliance with the Environmental and Social Management Plan and the lender's environmental and social standards and provides an independent report to the lenders following the visit. Please refer to question 4 below for further information.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Both the Project reports and the first IESC report are publicly available on the PNG LNG website. See:

        <p class="italic">
         Conflict, gender impacts and livelihoods are all areas monitored by the IESC, D'Appolonia, and their advice to the lenders is contained in their publicly available reports listed above.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) D'Appolonia, as the lenders' IESC, is required to liaise with civil society (including civil society organisations, government, local leaders and local communities) as part of its work.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Equator Principle 9 (Independent Monitoring and Reporting) requires the lender to appoint an independent environmental and/or social expert; or to oblige the borrower to retain qualified and experienced external experts to verify the borrower's monitoring information.

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In the case of the PNG LNG project, an independent expert has been retained by the borrower. Under the terms of the financing documents, EFIC and other lenders to the project will also have access to the services of an independent environmental and social consultant for the duration of the loan agreements.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) (a) D'Appolonia S.p.A. ("D'Appolonia"), located in Genoa, Italy, was appointed in March 2010 as the post-financial close Independent Environmental and Social Consultant ("IESC").
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) and (c) Since financial close D'Appolonia has conducted two site visits and one report has been finalised. Refer to the PNG LNG website for a copy of this report.

         (d) Section 2 of the D'Appolonia report (website link to report provided above) includes an Issues Table which summarises non-conformances (as that term is used in the D'Appolonia report).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) EFIC has not received notice of any breach of any obligation, undertaking or covenant with respect to the financing documents. Under the terms of these documents the borrower has an obligation to inform all Lenders, of which EFIC is one, of any such breach. Further, with each drawdown request (the frequency is approximately monthly) the borrower warrants that it is in compliance with the conditions under which the finance has been provided. In addition, no breaches of the agreed environmental and social obligations have been identified by independent monitoring undertaken by D'Appolonia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The following four answers have been provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs:

          Peter O'Neill

        <p class="italic">
         Since then, Finance has provided the PNG Government with an outline of its assessment of the critical tasks/elements and timing in establishing SWFs in PNG. Finance, where asked by the PNG Government, will continue to work with the PNG Government to develop an implementation plan for the SWFs as well as provide assistance with the implementation, as required.

        <p class="italic">
         Australia is emphasising the need for consistency with the Santiago Principles, which represent global best practice in the transparent management of SWFs.

         (7) (a) Point 13 of the Joint Understanding states PNG and Australia will establish a subcommittee of our annual Ministerial Forum to facilitate cooperation and review progress on the matters set out in the Joint Understanding. Terms of reference for the Australia-Papua New Guinea LNG Ministerial Subcommittee were agreed at its first meeting in Melbourne on 1 July 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) The terms of reference are not currently public. Their publication would require PNG Government approval.
