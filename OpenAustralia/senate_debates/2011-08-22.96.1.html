         I thank Senator Moore for her question and her continued interest in health issues. She has a passion for health, as does this government.

          The Senate
         </a>
         will recall that the Gillard government will be delivering a $2.2 billion mental health package, as announced in the federal budget. This package of funding is targeted at addressing the mental health challenges and gaps in our health system.
        </p>
        <p>
         This unprecedented funding for mental health requires the states and territories to play a key role in the delivery of those services. On Friday the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
          Council of Australian Governments
         </a>
         signed a critical national partnership agreement that will provide $200 million over five years to the states and territories to help address service gaps in accommodation and emergency department planning. This national partnership will work in conjunction with a decision from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         to develop a 10-year roadmap for mental health reform. This roadmap will chart the path ahead for our immediate priorities by examining the mental health system and how it will be placed 10 years from now. This will allow government to prepare the priorities and order of implementing reform so that our mental health system is the one that is right for the nation and its future challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Gillard government's mental health package announced in the budget was the largest ever delivered by a federal govern­ment. This package will identify and treat mental illness in the early years, support young people who struggle in their teens and help those who have severe and persistent mental issues and illnesses, with intensive support in the community. By signing a national partnership and agreeing on a 10-year roadmap we will be able to help achieve these crucial reforms in mental health right across the system to help those most in need. And of course it is what is needed for this country.

           I thank Senator Moore for her first supplementary question. The Prime Minister has made it clear that mental health is a national priority, correcting an area plagued by bad planning and underinvestment over the years under the Howard government.

           will recall that last week I informed the chamber about the govern­ment's landmark health reform deal struck between the Commonwealth and every state and territory. Today I can inform the Senate about the implementation of these reforms and how they are benefiting Australians in accessing and receiving better health care. We have been improving hospitals through delivery of over 70,000 extra elective surgery operations, we have increased funding, the MyHospitals website has been established and local hospital networks are up and running in

             I thank Senator Moore for her second supplementary question. The biggest risk to Australia's health system and patient care is the Liberal Party. Those opposite are led by a person who cut $1 billion out of the Australian health and hospital network. Not only did he cut from our health-care system but he has finally given to the Australian people an indication of his plans for the health and hospital system. It is remarkable for a Leader of the Opposition who rarely outlines his policies, but he has in this case. He has promised to do it all over again. Last week Mr Abbott told the AMA, 'If that is what I was like as a health minister you can be reasonably confident that that is what I will do as Prime Minister.'
            </p>
            <p>
             So now we know what it would be like under the Abbott government: a $1 billion cut to hospitals, capping

             training places, no action on nursing shortages, no health reform and no investment in elective surgery or emergency departments.
