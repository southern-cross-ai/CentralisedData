          Whoo! They lose it every time. Senator Grogan, I thank you for your question. I can confirm that new analysis shows that Australian households are saving from 39 to 57 per cent on their energy bills when they have rooftop solar installed. Imagine that: installing solar panels and saving on your energy bills.

            It seems that the opposition hates the idea of Australians saving money on their energy bills. But, by installing those rooftop solar panels, Australians are generating savings of between $822 and $1,350 per household on power bills, and that makes a significant difference to the hip pockets of Australian families. That's because, as this side of the chamber knows—and we have many examples right now before us of what that side of the chamber doesn't know—renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy. One in three Australian homes now have a solar installation, and the total small-scale solar capacity of Australia's 3.5 million household installations exceeds 21 gigawatts. That's the equivalent of 10 to 15 large coal-fired power stations. I am proud to say, Senator Rennick, that some of the biggest benefits are in Queensland. In South-East Queensland households with solar save 44 per cent on their bills, and in regional Queensland, Senator Canavan, households are saving 57 per cent on their bills. The Australian Energy Market Operator's latest report shows that the 31 per cent growth in rooftop solar output helped drive a 71 per cent reduction in wholesale prices in a year by reducing demand on the grid and reducing the use of more expensive sources of fuel during the day. That's why the Albanese government is ensuring wider access to cleaner, cheaper solar.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Grogan is right: the Nationals leader, Mr Littleproud, did call for a pause on renewables. At a time when Australians are dealing with cost-of-living pressures, the Nationals want to pause the price reductions Aussies are getting through renewables. We're getting on with the job of rolling out renewables.

              They're some impressive statistics, Senator Watt. Solar energy is really making a significant difference for so many people in this country. This month, Australians will receive further instalments on their energy rebates as part of the responsible cost-of-living support being rolled out by the Albanese government. Could you outline for us how many Australians are going to benefit from these rebates?

               Thank you, Senator Rennick, for confirming that the opposition's policy is to continue to oppose energy rebates. Thank you for confirming that, Senator Rennick. Unlike the opposition, the Albanese government's No. 1 priority is addressing inflation and cost-of-living pressures. That's why we are delivering targeted relief without adding to inflation. We're delivering energy price relief rebates to more than five million households and one million small businesses, to provide hundreds of dollars off bills. These will benefit eligible households by up to $500 and small businesses by up to $650 in total per year and are credited to power bills throughout the year. For households receiving rebates, bill increases in most jurisdictions have been completely offset and have decreased by up to 18 per cent for the most vulnerable Australians.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, not everyone in this chamber voted for that energy bill relief. When we voted for cheaper energy,

                Peter Dutton

               and the coalition said no. When we voted for cleaner energy, Peter Dutton and the coalition said no. But, when it comes to cost-of-living relief, Labor says yes.

                 Thank you, Senator Watt, for outlining that over the awful din from the other side of the chamber. I note that at the end of last year the Liberals and Nationals teamed up and voted against energy price relief for Australians and that

                  Peter Dutton
                 </a>
                 has said that, just like Reagan, he 'will wind back government intervention'. Given this, can the minister please inform the Senate how the coal and gas price caps are providing much-needed relief to Australian homes and businesses?

                   A recent report by the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Regulator" rel="nofollow">
                    Australian Energy Regulator
                   </a>
                   showed that wholesale electricity prices for the last quarter were less than half of those in the same period last year. And this highlights the significant impact that the Albanese government's coal and gas price caps are having on Australian power bills. We know that the job is not yet done when it comes to assisting with cost-of-living relief, but we've introduced a range of measures like this to add weight and assist Australians. But, for these caps that we introduced and we voted for, guess how the coalition voted? They voted no. When we voted to cap coal and gas prices, the coalition said no. And, of course, before he went off on his most recent world tour, Mr Dutton—they don't like being reminded, but we're going to keep reminding people—told an energy conference, 'Just like Reagan, we will wind back government intervention.' Now, what sort of intervention is Mr Dutton going to wind back? Is it coal and gas prices, or is it energy rebates?
