        <b>
         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill ensures that all federal system employees who work in the local government areas in which the APEC public holiday on 7 September 2007 is to be observed, will be entitled a paid day off on that public holiday.  On 4 July 2007, the Industrial and Other Legislation Amendment (APEC Public Holiday) Act 2007 (the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Act) was enacted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         NSW Parliament
        </a>
        .  The NSW Act deems 7 September 2007 as a public holiday under State industrial instruments for NSW employees who work in the local government areas in which the APEC public holiday is to be observed and would otherwise be required to work on that day.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the extent possible, the bill mirrors the approach taken in the NSW Act.  It applies only to those federal system employees working in areas in which the APEC public holiday is to be observed, and who are not covered by the statutory minimum public holiday entitlement in Part 12, Division 2 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.  For this reason, the legislation applies only to employees covered by pre-reform certified agreements, pre-reform
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workplace_Agreements" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workplace Agreements

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill relates specifically to public holiday entitlements on the APEC public holiday and therefore must be in place before the APEC public holiday on 7 September 2007. The bill will need to be introduced and passed by 16 August 2007.

       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         provide the legislation for new national welfare measures to help children at risk of neglect, or who are not enrolled at school or adequately attending school, by establishing a national income management regime, under which part of a person’s payment will be used to pay the priority needs of that person, their partner and their children, without reducing overall payments;
        </li>
        <li>
         establish an income management regime that applies in respect of people on certain welfare payments in the Northern Territory, as part of the Commonwealth’s Northern Territory National Emergency Response, and in Cape York;
        </li>
        <li>
         provide the remaining legislation in relation to the

        </li>
        <li>
         provide Supplementary Appropriation Bills that request legislative authority for further expenses to be incurred in 2007-2008.

        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The impact of sexual abuse on Indigenous children, families and communities is a most serious issue requiring decisive and prompt action.  To protect children and put an end to the dysfunction of communities requires a national emergency response.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Early passage would secure the early implementation of these important measures to help ensure that children receive appropriate care and attend school.  It would also secure the emergency response necessary in relation to the Australian Government’s response to the national emergency confronting the welfare of Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory, including by allowing funds to be made available to agencies.
