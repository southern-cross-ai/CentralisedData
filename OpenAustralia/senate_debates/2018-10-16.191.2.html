           The government's target for suicide is zero per cent. The idea that 75 per cent, or over 2,200 deaths per year, is acceptable is simply not acceptable to the government. The Minister for Health and the government have elevated mental health to be one of the four fundamental pillars of the long-term National Health Plan. Both the minister and the government regard mental health as inseparable and a central part of the Health portfolio and would regard such a separation as both a downgrade of mental health and a potentially damaging separation of mental health from physical health.

              Our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones to suicide today and every day. Labor adopted the National
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
               Mental Health
              </a>
              Commission's recommended target to reduce suicide by 50 per cent over 10 years at the 2016 election and has remained committed to that target since. We know that a robust target, backed by real resources from all levels of government, and an effective plan that supports long-term reform is what is needed to drive change. Today, we again call on the government to adopt the National Mental Health Commission's target to reduce suicide by 50 per cent over 10 years. Labor is proud to have had a minister or shadow minister for mental health since 2010, reflecting our dedication to this crucial issue.
