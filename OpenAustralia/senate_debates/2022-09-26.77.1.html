        . Since July, the opposition has been calling on the government to adopt the coalition's online privacy bill, which reflects the urgent need for greater online privacy protections on social media and other platforms, such as those run by telecommunications companies. What steps has the government taken to prioritise these reforms?

         FARRELL (—) (): I thank Senator Henderson for her question on this important topic, and, of course, it's got that extra element of importance as a result of the cybersecurity threats that we saw last week and over the weekend with respect to Optus.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think the starting point for a discussion about this, and I think this is what we've discovered, is how little the previous government did in this space, and that the problems that we've now inherited are problems because we—

           <p>
            I was trying to explain that the reason that we need legislation in this space is, of course, because the previous government did nothing about it. I noticed Senator Hume's comments over the weekend where she said, 'We don't have policies. We are in opposition, not in government.' I think what is now very clear is not only does the opposition not have policies in opposition, they never had any policies in government.

               Thank you, President. The Albanese Labor government is committed to protecting Australia's personal information. The rise of the digital platforms and the use of modern technology has created a whole host of new privacy challenges and risks that we saw over the weekend, including the collection and the use of a vast amount of personal information by social media platforms. Australians should have better control over how their personal data is collected and used, and confidence that when they engage with a business or a government agency their data will be protected and not misused. Australia's—

                 The Optus cyberattack must surely be a wake-up call about the urgent need of greater online privacy protections. Isn't it the case that the government has been asleep at the wheel on both the need for the online privacy bill and border reforms of the

                  Senator Henderson, you can't be serious about asking that question. You cannot be serious about asking that question, because for 10 years—for 10 years—including time when were in the lower House, you did nothing about this issue. We find that the issues that occurred last week with Optus have occurred in a set of circumstances where there is no legislative protection based on all of the years—all of the years—you had to deal with it.

                  We do intend to protect Australians' privacy. We do intend to protect it. I might point out to you, Senator Henderson, that we've only been in government for a few months. You had 10 years. You had 10 long years to—

                    As part of the former government's consultation on the online privacy bill, Optus argued that telecommunications companies should be exempt from tougher online privacy laws. More broadly, Telstra and Optus also argued against consumers having the right to erase their personal data. Does the government agree that telecommunications companies should be exempt from tougher online privacy laws?

                      I doubt whether Optus is running that argument today, but can I say this. The Attorney-General and the Attorney-General's Department have engaged extensively with experts, community organisations, businesses and privacy advocates on his proposed privacy act. The department so far—and I'm happy to provide these to you—has provided two consultation papers, has received 434 submissions and has held a series of round tables. So, I don't think—

                          I started out my answer by saying that I doubt very much whether Optus is now pursuing that particular argument. Well, I've explained to you all the things the Attorney-General is doing in order to consult with all the relevant organisations.
