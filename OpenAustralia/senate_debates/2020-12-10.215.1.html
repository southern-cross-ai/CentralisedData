           The government does not support this motion. ABS data confirms that the biggest increase on the record to the rate of casual employment occurred under the Hawke and Keating governments, with the level then remaining steady thereafter for more than 20 years leading into the COVID pandemic. Incentivising the growth of stable, permanent jobs and higher incomes are two of the key goals of the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2020.
