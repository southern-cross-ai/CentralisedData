        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. After Senator Sinodinos stood aside while being investigated then Prime Minister Abbott said, 'Senator Sinodinos has done the right thing.' Why is Prime Minister Morrison refusing to ensure Minister Taylor does the right thing—by standing aside while he is being investigated by the special strike force, Strike Force Garrad, established by the

         I can tell Senator McAllister precisely why—because the circumstances are very different. Here is an assessment by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         Police, which has been triggered by a single, politically motivated, partisan letter written by a political opponent, who couldn't get into the Attorney-General's job at an election, so he continues with his serial political smears. He's a serial letter writer anyway. Could you imagine if a letter from Mr Dreyfus became the new test of whether or not somebody can keep their ministerial job? He would be writing even more letters. It's a completely ludicrous proposition. You should reflect on it. One day perhaps the Australian people will elect you back into government. Do you want to expose yourself to the letter writers on this side of the parliament? Do you really think that a job that you may have in the future should depend on whether or not a political opponent of yours writes a letter? That is just ridiculous.

            If you're going to go down this road, do you want me to go through the list of former Labor ministers and prime ministers who were being investigated and didn't step aside? Do you really want me to go down that path? Really? Let's just remind ourselves. I think the media are well aware of the plethora of Labor ministers in the most recent government who were subject to investigations and stayed in their positions, including a Prime Minister. Let me just say that it's completely inappropriate for you to suggest that a minister should be stood aside on the basis of a politically motivated letter from a political opponent. That is not an appropriate basis. That should never become the trigger.

That is their track record. And let me tell you: you would not want a single politically motivated partisan letter to become the test on whether or not a minister is stood aside.
