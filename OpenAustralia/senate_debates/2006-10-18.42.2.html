            I thank Senator Heffernan for the question and note his very sensible and often robust contributions to this debate on support for our drought-stricken farmers. I am aware of the claims made by Dr Hamilton to which the honourable senator refers—claims which I can say the government categorically rejects.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
             OECD
            </a>
            figures indicate that, compared to the rest of the world, the Australian government’s support for our farmers is relatively low. In other words: they are very, very efficient.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Japan" rel="nofollow">
             In Japan
            </a>
            , farm income from the government is 56 per cent; in the European Union, 32 per cent; in the United States, 16 per cent. In Australia, it is just five per cent. Yet Dr Hamilton would deign to tell us that we are propping up unviable farmers. The fact is Dr Hamilton’s claims are simply not credible.
           </p>
           <p>
            This Dr Hamilton heads the so-called
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Institute" rel="nofollow">
             Australia Institute
            </a>
            , a left-wing think tank—now there is an oxymoron if ever you have had one; but that is what he does. The institute acts as a stalking horse for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Labor Party
            </a>
            and the Greens and advances a number of nutbag propositions; any number of nutbag propositions come out of this institute.
           </p>
           <p>
            The head of this institute is also the author of a book called
            <i>
             The Mystic Economist
            </i>
            , and it appears that mysticism informs his economic prognostications, such as those he made yesterday. Let me explain. Some time ago on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_National" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
             for Meaning
            </i>
            , Dr Hamilton said this—and I would invite all honourable senators to listen very carefully:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Out of the blackness appeared the figure of my shadow. He’d shown himself several times in dreams over the previous months I realised subsequently, especially in one where this figure appeared as a murderer and as an abuser of women ...
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            I entered into a dialogue with this figure who appeared before me. I spoke to him ... and he told me that his name was Jacob. And from his mouth spewed the most foul salvo of abuse that was imaginable, and I was wracked by overpowering emotion—almost more than I could bear ... And so I talked to Jacob and calmed him down and befriended him, and ultimately forgave him for being part of me.

                 The simple fact is this is the head of a left-wing think tank who used all of those words. When I quote the words of the stalking horse of the Labor Party, they think I have lost it. They are not my words; they are the left wing’s words. These are the people the Labor Party and the Greens rely on to develop their economic policy for this country, and when we quote back their words they laugh and scoff. They should be laughing and scoffing at Dr Hamilton, who has done a great disservice to farmers.
