        Australia is entitled to be assured that its senior representative on the international stage is a respectable and credible person. Putting political differences aside, nobody could doubt that Mr Kevin Rudd, when he was the foreign minister, was a respectable and serious person. Nobody could doubt that his predecessor as foreign minister, Mr Stephen Smith, was a serious and reputable person. But I am sorry to say that the current foreign minister, who likes to posture and present an urbane face to the world, is not, on inspection, a serious and reputable person. All that glisters is not gold, and, although Senator Bob Carr is so intellectually vain that he even wrote a book about how many books he has read, when you look at Senator Bob Carr's record as a public figure in

        , and when you consider the response today in the Senate when he was taken to task for it, that record is one of shame and disgrace. This is what his successor as the Labor

       <p class="italic">
        Well he made him a cabinet minister and not only did he make him a cabinet minister, he waltzed into the caucus room when the vote was happening and very publically voted for him. To send a message that, 'Not only am I gonna vote for Eddie, but here, look at this, all of you should vote for him as well.' And why was he made a cabinet minister? For services rendered and support given.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those are not the words of a Liberal politician. Those are the words of Mr Morris Iemma, Senator Bob Carr's successor as the Premier of New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such was the cesspit of corruption in New South Wales politics during the time of Mr Bob Carr's premiership, such was the Sumerian gloom into which that state had descended when he led it, that counsel assisting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
         ICAC
        </a>
        inquiry before Justice Ipp, which is sitting in Sydney at the moment, described it as 'the most corrupt government of New South Wales since the Rum Corps'—again, not a politician, not a political opponent, but the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
         QC
        </a>
        assisting the Ipp inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The person who presided over that corrupt government—the person who fostered the political career of the source of the corruption, as we now know, Mr Eddie Obeid—was none other than Senator Bob Carr. Senator Carr might mock his accusers on the floor of the Senate today and he might mock the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Senate
        </a>
        , who seeks to call him to order, but one thing he cannot escape is the stain on his reputation: that he, Senator Bob Carr, as the Premier of New South Wales, presided over the most corrupt government of New South Wales since the Rum Corps and that he, Senator Bob Carr, promoted, fostered, advanced and protected the political career of Mr Eddie Obeid, in the words of Mr Morris Iemma, 'for services rendered and support given'. That is Senator Bob Carr's legacy, and all the honeyed words, all the courtly phrases and all the intellectual grace and charm which Senator Bob Carr affects with all the credibility of a kabuki actor cannot conceal his record, now exposed for the public of New South Wales and the public of Australia to see: that corruption flourished like a forest plant under Senator Bob Carr's premiership. This, embarrassingly, is the face Australia now presents to the world.

         I rise this afternoon in response to the answers that were given in question time and in response to Senator Brandis and, no doubt, speakers that will follow him. I take offence at some of the comparisons that Senator Brandis used then in relation to one of my colleagues—in fact, in relation to any senator in this chamber. It is an unfortunate position you find yourself in when you cannot actually take note and debate the facts and you have to resort to some personal intimations. I think people listening to this do not appreciate that.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are just two things I want to say before I talk about foreign affairs. One is that, of course, Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Carr" rel="nofollow">
          Bob Carr
         </a>
         has not been Premier of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         for nearly seven years now, so people out there will probably be thinking, 'What is this all about now that he is not only a member of the federal parliament but also Australia's foreign minister?' So let us get that on the record.
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondly, I just want to say something in relation to what happened today, when we spent 15 minutes on this first question in the Senate—which, of course, was not related at all to any policy matter or any significant area of reform that this government is trying to undertake. One thing I know is that, when we all come into this chamber as senators, we are asked to complete accurately—always accurately and truthfully—our declaration of senators' interests. One of the things we know, which is now fact, is that one senator in this place, Senator Arthur Sinodinos, did not complete his register of senators' interests correctly—surprisingly, you may say, because he was former Prime Minister John Howard's chief of staff. Why would he not have done that? Surely it was not because he did not know to do it; he clearly did.

          Mr Deputy President, on a point of order on relevance: the question was directed entirely to Senator Carr's conduct and reputation as the Premier of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          . I might remind you, Mr Deputy President, that when Senator Carr, in answer to that question, sought to do what Senator Crossin is now doing—that is, cast aspersions at another senator—the President drew him to the question and, by doing so, ruled that that matter was not responsive to the question.

            You see, it is relevant, because all roads in relation to the declaration of interests by Senator Sinodinos lead to Mr Obeid and to the fact that Senator Sinodinos had shares in a business that was owned significantly by that gentleman and they were not declared on his interests. The point I simply want to make here is that we can spend forever and a day trying to throw aspersions at Senator Carr, throw mud at Senator Carr and malign his nature and his character, but he has been out of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

            in New South Wales, if you are going to have a look at what is going on at this side of the chamber—or purport to look at what happened on this side of the chamber—then you want to have a really good look at what is happening a couple of seats down from you and the failure to declare in your declaration of interests any interests you might have had in this matter at all.

It gives me a chance in relation to Senator Carr and his portfolio to talk about what work we are doing overseas in supporting women.

             Senator Crossin, I did rule that you were in order in the first part when there was a point of order taken, but now I think you are straying from the topic, as Senator Carr did not mention that in any of his answers at all. So I just draw you to the fact that we are taking—

              I do not want to reflect on the decision of the chair, but what the coalition is clearly trying to do is suggest that somehow, in some way, Senator Carr at some stage in his past has been involved in activities that are not scrupulous. That is seriously not the case. It is seven years ago. We have debated this topic, and no doubt it has been raised in the media. But, if we want to talk about Senator Carr and his performance, let us talk about his performance as foreign affairs minister. Why are we not talking about that during question time? Why are we not asking Senator Carr, on the back of

                 What we are taking note of, I would have thought, is the foreign minister's integrity. As often as Senator Brandis might want to pop up like a jack-in-a-box and suggest that we ought to talk about some negative aspect of this person's integrity and his judgement, we can also talk about the positive role this foreign minister has played. We could also talk about some of the outstanding achievements we have made, particularly when we talk about our commitment to women overseas on the back of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 . Or we could talk about all of the other senators in this place who actually do lodge a declaration of interest when they are required to, and it is accurate and it is truthful and it does not miss out aspects of our lives that we know have to be recorded in this parliament.

I did work for that outstanding minister Mr Bruce Baird. And I did have the opportunity to observe closely the then Mr Carr and the way that New South Wales Labor operated. You might recall a fellow by the name of Rex 'Buckets' Jackson, who was a minister in a government in which Mr Carr himself served.

                       But 1999 was not the first time Mr Carr tried to appoint Mr Obeid to the frontbench. He tried in 1995. He backed Mr Obeid over the then opposition frontbencher Mr Bob Martin. It is part of

And let us not forget Ms Gabrielle Harrison, who was dumped to make way for Mr Obeid so that he could become the minister for minerals and fisheries. He was known and Mr Coal and Mr Fish.

I do not know Senator Sinodinos all that well—we do not serve on any committees together—but I have come to the conclusion that he is quite a polite gentlemen. He often says hello to us in the corridors and he is generally very polite, and so I was very disappointed that he had failed to declare an interest on a number of board—

                          directorships—thank you so much. I think it was about six all up. That is of great concern to me because when we first come to the Senate we are all told how important it is to declare all of our interests. Everybody else manages to do that, but Senator Sinodinos, who is obviously smart—I understand he was handpicked to work for Mr Howard—could not get it right and declare these interests. I wonder whether that was an oversight because he might have been embarrassed that he too has been linked to Mr Obeid.

                          For the opposition to come in here and try to make a mountain out of a molehill and put it back on Senator Carr personally is absolutely disgraceful. Senator Carr is highly commended on the international stage as the foreign affairs minister. He is highly commended—

It must be perilously close to being against standing orders to reflect on a former senator. For the record, Senator Santoro resigned. He was not dismissed, he was not sacked. He chose to leave the front bench in the parliament.

                             Whether he resigned or whether he was sacked—I understood he was sacked, and if I am wrong I am happy to retract that—the issue was it all happened because he failed to declare on his register of interests that he had shareholdings in various businesses. I will quote what Mr Howard had to say at that time, and the reason I am doing this is that I am wondering why Mr Abbott has not taken up the issue with Senator Sinodinos about this. Mr Howard said at the time:
                            </p>
                            <p class="italic">
                             This is a clear breach of the Senate rules and of his obligation to me—
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             that being Mr Howard. He went on:

                            <p class="italic">
                             He had no alternative but to resign.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             So I take it back, Senator, and I apologise—he did resign. He was going to be sacked so he jumped first, obviously. The quote went on:
                            </p>
                            <p class="italic">

But there was no reference, not remotely, to former Senator Santoro—or, as I should describe him now, Commendatore Santoro—and therefore I would ask you to rule that this contribution by Senator Bilyk is irrelevant.

I was going to rule that there is no point of order, but I take note of Senator Brandis's remarks—as I did when it was raised against Senator Fifield—and I remind Senator Bilyk, as I did Senator Fifield, of the nature of the topic that we are debating. You had started to stray off topic for a short while, Senator Bilyk, so I just remind you what the topic is.

                                  The question was brought up by those on the other side and there was some debate about why they would try to do that to themselves. There is concern, I know, about whose seat Senator Sinodinos might take to get him to the front bench—whether it is when you are in government or in opposition. I know that most people on the other side will do whatever they can to smear and belittle people on this side of the chamber, as they tried to do with Senator Carr, who, as I said, is most highly respected in international area. He has managed to do so much for Australia in the relatively short time he has been the foreign minister. He has secured a seat for Australia as a non-permanent member of the

Those are just three things out of a number of things that Senator Carr has been able to do in the time he has been in that position. Those on the other side will do anything to throw mud at this side. They know that one on their side did the wrong thing—
