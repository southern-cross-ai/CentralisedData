        I rise to make some remarks about the 50th anniversary of the election to this place of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Bonner" rel="nofollow">
         Neville Bonner

        , who was the first Indigenous person to become a federal parliamentarian. Bonner became involved with politics from the 1967 referendum, which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Holt" rel="nofollow">

        conducted successfully. He was handing out how-to-vote cards on referendum day when he was asked by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hayden" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Hayden
        </a>
        why he was helping out with the Liberals. I think that annoyed him, so he subsequently decided that he would become a Liberal parliamentarian. Good on him.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was a great historical figure, and he served in the Senate for 12 years. In his first speech, he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Less than 200 years ago the white man came … my people were shot, poisoned, hanged and broken in spirit until they became refugees in their own land. But that is history and we take care now of the present while … we look to the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that is a very fine sentiment as we reflect upon the 50th anniversary of Bonner's contribution. To their great credit, an organisation called Uphold &amp; Recognise worked with Bonner's family to produce a video they released last week, which was funded by Mr Greg O'Neill of the La Trobe Financial foundation. It is a very good summary of Bonner's political contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I thank everyone involved—
