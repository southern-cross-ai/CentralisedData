        , Minister Wong. Earlier this month, global temperatures crept 1½ degrees above historic averages for the first time in human history. Current coal, oil and gas production continuing in operation will permanently blow the safe 1½ degree limit. We have to wind down production, not expand it, if we're going to have any fighting chance of stopping a climate breakdown. Is the government still going to proceed with its $1.9 billion taxpayer subsidy for developing

          , I will get perhaps a little more sophisticated answer than I'm urged to by those opposite. I will try to get a little more information on that, Senator Waters.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the broader proposition which the senator is putting: I understand that the Greens party has a view that the way to deal with climate change in an international global economy is for Australia to shut down its gas exports and to shut down its gas industry. We don't agree. We believe that the task we have been set with—and we wish it were not after so many years of inaction on the other side—is to transition what is a very resource-intensive economy on a pathway to net zero by 2050. And the imperative of that is not only climate; the imperative of that is also jobs. If the majority of the global economy is moving to a net zero by 2050 target, which it is—I think 84 per cent of global
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
           GDP
          </a>
          has made that commitment—then we have to be able to compete in that world.
         </p>
         <p>
          I outlined in my first government question, the question from Senator Sheldon—as have others—the many investments the government is making in hydrogen and in renewable energy in the transition of the economy that I have described. We don't take the view that you take, that the way to deal with this is just to make sure that we shut down some of those industries overnight. So we have a fundamental difference of policy about how to deal with this.

            , again called for an end to the use of coal, oil and gas and shamed global fossil fuel companies, who are spending 4c on clean energy or carbon capture for every dollar they are spending on new oil and gas expansion. Why is the government giving these tax-avoiding big polluters billions every year in taxpayer funded subsidies instead of redirecting those billions into stopping the climate crisis?

             First, I think anybody who looked at the history of this over the last 10 years, and certainly the history of when we were last in government, if they are a fair-minded person, would recognise the commitment that the

             and Labor governments have had to action on climate change. Despite the climate wars, we spent many years on that side of the chamber continuing to argue a position in the face of a climate policy or an energy policy run by

             and the National Party. The fact that the Liberal Party took that path has been, I think, to the detriment of the country.

             I refer back to my previous answer, Senator Waters. I don't accept many of the assertions in your question in relation to how you are characterising certain matters, but we do believe—

                , some of them more than once, and I have said the same things. Firstly, I talk about how, unlike some of our predecessors, we hear and understand that climate change is their No. 1 national security and economic issue. I talk to them about the fact that not only a government but a parliament has been elected that wants to take action on climate change. I talk to them about our need to transition, that we recognise that we have had a great benefit from the resources that Australia has but also understand that where we want to be by 2050 will require a change in our economy at a scale that hasn't been seen since probably the industrial revolution. I am clear with them about our policies, our ambition, our intent and our commitment to act.
