          I rise on a point of order on a matter of direct relevance. The question was about the meeting of targets by 30 June. Given the election date is apparently 14 September, I cannot possibly see how the coalition's policies are relevant to achieving a 30 June target date set by the minister. You commit; do you still stand by it?

             would pass 286,000 premises by 30 June. He has given context, but he does have time to give the assurance that was asked of him or to tell the Senate that he cannot give that assurance. But that was the only he was asked, and you should direct him to it.

                   Co. to assist in bringing it together and overcoming those challenges, but the NBN Co. has an enormous challenge in organising with their contracting partners that ramp up. We have made it clear that there are challenges in meeting those targets and we are seeking more information.

                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    Co. is preparing to slash as early as next week its rollout forecast by more than half to just 140,000 premises. Does the minister have any knowledge of any reassessment of targets by NBN Co.? Has the minister received any updated advice from NBN Co. or his department since the Senate estimates advice that he keeps relying on?

                     . No, I have not received any information that there is a target of 140,000 at all. I have not received any information. But let me be clear:
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

                     Co. go through probably a daily assessment about how their partners are going. They are in constant contact seeking information from their construction partners. I am seeking to gain information from the NBN Co. to find out where that process is up to. My understanding is that NBN Co. is consulting their construction partners to ensure that the construction partners are ramping up and that they are seeking to ramp up as fast as they can.
