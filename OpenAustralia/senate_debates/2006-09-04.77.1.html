        by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Malaysia and Japan, which took place from 10 to 22 April 2006, and seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.

       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:

       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the document.
       </p>
       <p>
        The visit of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Malaysia and Japan, which I participated in, was significant for a number of reasons. It has been some time since a delegation visited the countries. The last official parliamentary delegation to visit Malaysia was in 1998. The relationships with both countries, for differing reasons, are enormously important to Australia and the visit provided the opportunity to enhance the already strong connections which Australia has with each country.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation received a very warm welcome from both countries and was treated very generously by the parliaments in Malaysia and Japan. I would like to thank the host parliaments and their presiding officers for their hospitality and the very interesting nature of the programs they organised. The strength of Australia’s relationship with Malaysia is underpinned by the links developed as a result of the 250,000 Malaysians who are alumni of Australia’s educational institutions. Many of these people are now in senior roles in Malaysia, creating a strong basis for mutual understanding and friendship.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trade and investment have now become an important element in the relationship, with Malaysia being Australia’s second largest trading partner in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        and ninth largest trading partner overall. The delegation considers that there are further opportunities for trade and investment to expand, particularly for Australian companies in Malaysia. Australia’s bilateral relationship with Japan is both longstanding and very strong. The basis for the relationship has been the very strong trading connection, with Japan being Australia’s largest trading partner for more than 40 years. The relationship has broadened and deepened and now encompasses defence and security relationships, cultural and people-to-people ties and a strong mutual interest in regional issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst in Japan, the delegation strongly reiterated the message which the Prime Minister has conveyed, that Australia has no greater friend in Asia than Japan. The delegation was able to explore a number of regional issues which are foremost in the minds of the Japanese. Australia is in various stages of negotiations to conclude free trade agreements with both Malaysia and Japan. The delegation found there was considerable interest in and support for free trade agreements with Australia in both countries. The delegation urges the Australian government to pursue this interest to a successful conclusion, as it will be to our mutual benefit to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation also recommends that the opportunities for Malaysian parliamentarians and senior public servants to visit Australia continue and acknowledges that there is further promotion to Australian businesses of trade and investment opportunities in Malaysia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation had the opportunity in both Malaysia and Japan to recognise different aspects of the history of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . Both were moving experiences for the delegation during the visit. In Malaysia, the delegation visited the Sandakan Memorial Park in eastern Sabah, which was the location of a Japanese prisoner of war camp for Australian and British troops. As a result of the brutality of their treatment both in Sandakan and on forced marches into the interior of Borneo, only six of the Australian prisoners of war survived to the end of the war.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Japan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the delegation visited Hiroshima, one of the two Japanese cities devastated by an atomic bomb towards the end of the war in the Pacific. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Museum" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the memorial monument of Hiroshima, which the delegation visited, provide a lasting reminder of the devastation which can be caused by nuclear weapons. The delegation recommends that Australian cities and local governments consider becoming involved in the Mayors for Peace program, which has been promoted by the City of Hiroshima since 1982.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank my fellow delegation members: Mr John Forrest MP, Ms Sharon Grierson MP, Mr Barry Haase MP and the honourable Peter Slipper MP for their support and company during the visit. I particularly thank the leader of the delegation, the Hon. David Hawker MP,

        , and the deputy delegation leader, the member for Corio, Mr Gavan O’Connor.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank all of those who assisted with the visit. I thank officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Parliamentary Library for their briefings. I thank the

I thank the Ambassador in Japan, His Excellency Mr Murray McLean, and his staff, particularly Ms Catherine Wallace, for their assistance. I would also like to thank the delegation secretary, Mr David Elder, and the Speaker’s senior adviser, Mr Chris Paterson, for their assistance with the visit.
