        The economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic could not have come at a less convenient time for Tasmania. In recent years my home state had turned an economic corner and was powering ahead, after years of budget mismanagement and economic turmoil under the previous state Labor-Greens government. Business confidence was up, retail trade was booming, cranes dominated the Hobart skyline, and Tasmania's reputation as a first-class visitor destination for interstate and international tourists alike was second to none. Tasmanians were feeling confident about the future. An increase in the number of jobs in the state meant Tasmanians were reconsidering their need to move to the mainland for work, reversing a sad historical trend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then the pandemic hit, bringing to a halt all of our positive momentum and slamming the brakes on the progress we had made over the last few years. I was worried that we would see a return to the bad old days where Tasmanians were leaving the state in droves, the unemployment rate was at an all-time high and business confidence was almost non-existent.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the weeks following the initial fallout from the virus and over the course of 2020, the Morrison coalition government introduced unprecedented levels of support for individuals, families and businesses to weather the worst of the economic downturn. Budget initiatives in the form of tax cuts have helped ease cost-of-living pressures by putting more money back into the pockets of Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail figures show that Tasmanians have been spending this money locally, taking up the call to support local business by buying Tasmanian produce and manufactured goods. Tasmanians have taken it upon themselves to spread the economic love across our state, responding to the call to holiday at home. We've relished the opportunity to get out and explore our own backyard, rediscovering places we haven't visited for an extended period or stopping off at locations we inevitably put off to travel further afield. Every cup of coffee, every petrol stop, every meal purchased and every overnight accommodation booked supports local businesses and jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a government, we have been focusing on investing in job-creating projects to further enhance Tasmania's economic recovery. A $150 million commitment to duplicate the Sorell and

        causeways will improve the safety and travel time along this busy transport corridor. An investment in Tasmania's iconic tourism drawcards, including

        </a>
        and the celebrated

        </a>
        , will ensure these sites can continue to welcome visitors for years to come. This kind of targeted investment is exactly the type of stimulus the economy needs right now, creating better public and community infrastructure and, most importantly, creating local jobs. While we still have a way to go, the seeds of our economic revival have begun to sprout and will only grow stronger over the course of this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The release of the Tasmanian Treasury's revised estimates report for the 2020-21 financial year has confirmed the island state is on the mend, and our economy is starting to recover from the crisis. Strong uptake of the Commonwealth and Tasmanian HomeBuilder grant program saw dwelling approvals skyrocket in December last year, with the number of dwelling approvals at more than 95 per cent above the same period in the previous year, creating increased activity in the building and construction sector and supporting jobs around the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ABS labour force statistics released last week further confirm Tasmania's positive economic trajectory, with employment on par with pre-pandemic levels. Our unemployment rate is now the lowest of all the Australian states, at 5.9 per cent, having fallen a further per cent just in January. This is fantastic news for the island state, which, before the spread of COVID-19, was smashing economic records under the leadership of former Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman and current Premier Peter Gutwein, with the support of a federal coalition government. This doesn't happen by accident.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a government, we will be continuing our efforts to support job creation and create economic prosperity across Australia and throughout regional communities, particularly in Tasmania. The vaccination program is the next crucial step along our path to economic recovery, and the rollout, which commenced this week, has the economic forecast for 2021 looking more positive. My strong hope and the ambition I share with Tasmanians is that we can get our state back on track and continue on our journey towards economic prosperity as soon as possible. I'm confident we can build upon this success to come out of this crisis stronger than ever.
