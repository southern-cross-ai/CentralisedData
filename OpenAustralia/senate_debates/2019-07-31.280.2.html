         I acknowledge the traditional owners of this place and pay my respects to elders, past, present and emerging. I'm so proud to be in the Ngunnawal country in the parliament of the

          Commonwealth of Australia
         </a>
         , a House for all people. And I pledge to progress the agenda of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, to recognise

        </p>
        <p>
         I start by thanking those responsible for me being here—first and foremost, my family. My compassionate and progressive parents, Neil and Gwen. They were both born in marriages of mixed religion in the 1920s, quite the scandal of the day. They later raised my brothers and sisters in the Catholic faith, as I raised my own children, Liam and Lily—who are here today. All four generations have interpreted religion in their own way, and have their own relationship with faith, both religious and not. But our guiding principle was perhaps best expressed by the American Protestant,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Monroe_Sheldon" rel="nofollow">
          Charles Monroe Sheldon
         </a>
         —would you believe, a great, great uncle of mine. In the book
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_His_Steps" rel="nofollow">
           In His Steps
          </a>
          ,
         </i>
         one of the most read books about faith in human history, he asked and answered the question: what would Jesus do? It's a simple question to get us all, regardless of our beliefs, thinking about the ethical and moral implications of what we do in life, and the consequences of those actions.
        </p>
        <p>
         I reference this book because my parents shared this philosophy. They lived a life of service. They did this whilst raising six children, any of whom, not doubt—of course, not me!—caused them to question their faith from time to time. Dad was an industrial chemist, born in Lewisham, and mum was a nurse, born in Mudgee and trained at Bathurst Hospital. They were committed Labor people and fierce anticommunists, or 'groupers', as anticommunists were called at that time. Yet they believed so deeply in democracy that they campaigned in the 1950s against outlawing the very communism they despised.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 1972, Dad was asked by Senator Arthur Gietzelt, the legendary Labor Minister for Veterans' Affairs, to run as a Labor candidate for Cook, the seat now held by the Prime Minister. They are both Sharkies tragics, but I add that that's probably where the similarities stop. Dad declined the chance to be an MP, and it was a time when mum, as a woman, would have never even be considered, and that's a shame. What it did mean, however, was that the Sheldon household was one of fiery and spirited debate. Such was the vigour,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President

         , that we could have used your services and standing orders. On the winning side were my siblings, Cath, Diane, John, Lynne and Phil. On the other side was a young Tony. Standing here today, as a senator in the parliament of Australia, with my family in the gallery, the temptation to re-litigate those lost battles under the veil of parliamentary privilege is absolutely overwhelming, but I will resist. I am forever grateful to my parents and siblings. I thank them for their love, counsel and friendship.

         I joined the

         at the age of 14. The fact that one wasn't allowed to join until the age of 15 didn't seen especially important, particularly when your dad was a returning officer! From this day on, the ALP, and the trade union movement, would become a second family. In this extended family, I've met and worked with the very best. I speak of the National Secretary of the

          Steve Hutchins
         </a>
         . When ex-Labor parliamentarian

          Michael Lee
         </a>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">
          Kim Beazley
         </a>
         : 'The industrial movement is critical for a democracy. Ordinary Australians can speak through it on the needs of everyday Australians in a debate dominated by privilege and elites. Grounded by this, Steve took the voices of working people into a parliamentary career of real substance and achievement.' I recall in 1994 Steve called me and my workmate Wayne Forno to his office. He was as fired up as you could be, rallying against the low wages of our members and the greed of some of the transport industry's major clients. He asked this question: 'What good are we if we allow this to continue?' He then told us that they needed a 15 per cent wage increase over two years. Privately, Wayne and I thought Steve was being a little bit optimistic. Truth be told, we may have used different and much more exotic language at the time, given the scale of the ask, but we fell in behind the leader, as loyal people do. What happened next?
        </p>
        <p>
         This great man, with no hope of success, succeeded, bringing all the benefits it generated for hundreds of thousands of both union and non-union transport workers' families. Millions of dollars were then spent generating and sustaining thousands of jobs. If all of Steve's leadership could be condensed into a sentence, it would be this: never limit yourself beliefs, always upsize your dreams and then fight like hell to achieve them. Thank you, Steve. Rest well, comrade. I welcome to the Senate Natalie, Xavier and Linda, Steve's family, here today. My friends, your dad, brother and husband will always be one of the greats.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the movement, of course, there are other greats as well. Wonderful men and women like Gerard Hayes, Graeme Kelly, Alex Glayson and Bob Nandar, Daniel Walton and

        </p>
        <p>
         In New South Wales, I also thank and recognise Kaila Murnain, alongside her deputies Pat and George. Kaila has reformed the culture of New South Wales ALP head office in a way which was sorely needed. I thank Daniel Mookie, a true and loyal friend of great integrity, as well as Adam Searle and Mark Buttigieg, who fight every day in the New South Wales parliament for working people. Thank you for joining me today.

I responded by saying I'm truly surprised any time I see him in a suit and tie. I suspect Albo might say the same thing about me.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also acknowledge all of my caucus colleagues, both in the House and in the Senate led by

         . And I welcome my fellow new ALP senators, Tim Ayres, Marielle Smith, Raff Ciccone and Nita Green. I also acknowledge some splendid friends from the other side of politics:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Gay" rel="nofollow">
          Duncan Gay

        <p>
         On this note, again, I reference Steve Hutchins's magnificent 15 per cent pay rise victory. I also recognise

         and Hugh McMaster, Laurie de Peace, Maurice Boroni, John Begetti, and Terry and Arthur Tzaneros, two wonderful people, employers who also understand that honest and genuine disagreement can yield good results. These are the captains of industry who distinguish themselves from a small minority of others. I refer to the Leigh Cliffords of the world, people who are not in control of their ideology and who would and have grounded an airline for pride. Enough said about these types. I will have plenty of opportunities in the next six years.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have entered parliament with 42 years in the workforce. Every battle scar and every victory are lessons I carry with me to this very moment. I've been a garbo and a bar attendant. My first job was as a 16-year-old amusement park worker at the Punchbowl fair. For the record, and as a rejection of the claim of my children, I stress that I was not the amusement! I was the Ferris wheel operator, working unpaid for six weeks on the promise of more work, which never arrived—an early lesson never forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
         Later I stood with decent and hardworking brewery workers in the first-ever sit-in in Castlemaine brewery against unfair and uneven wage increases. I stood up against the likes the infamous Bellino brothers, of Fitzgerald inquiry fame, who ran illegal nightclubs in Brisbane, grossly underpaying their workforce. The inquiry was a response to a series of articles about high-level police corruption, reported by Phil Dickie and then immortalised in the

        </p>
        <p>
         I've taken calls from truck drivers who were being force-supplied by their employers with drugs to keep them awake in an effort to meet the cost demands of clients—drivers who were told that if they contacted the police or didn't take the drugs they would lose their jobs and worse. I've been to the funerals of those who have paid the ultimate price, comforting loved ones in the depths of unimaginable grief. That is why I vow that I will not rest until this parliament restores safe rates into this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         I witnessed the collapse of the national airline under a narrow-minded government. I've stood with brave men and women, like Dave Lupton from Ansett—and Dave's with us today—for more than 100 days to win a government-guaranteed redundancy payment. Like many others, I've sat at the witness box at a royal commission, with no prima facie case to answer for anything. That trade union royal commission will be forever remembered as a wretched abuse of executive power, where the presumption of innocence became a presumption of guilt. And all the while the government of the day evaded, protected and denied the misdeeds of a banking sector which was institutionally, morally and culturally corrupt, demonstrating the real aim, which is this government's obsessive culture war on working people and their representatives. My four hours in the witness box—I won't go so far as to say that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Heydon" rel="nofollow">

          Transport Workers' Union
         </a>
         was a collective of terrific people bonded by decency, integrity and a determination to support our members. I add that these were also the values missing in the executive ranks of the banking sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         Friends, beyond our shores I've been honoured to lead negotiations for international safe rates agreements and road safety under the auspices of the

        </p>
        <p>
         I've observed with a quiet but growing rage as migrant workers without the rights of Australian citizens have their labour exploited. This undercuts the wages of local labour as well, a crazy double whammy benefitting very few.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've watched with concern as both Labor and coalition parties tore down multiple prime ministers, with the unintended consequences of emptying the reservoir of goodwill that our people have towards their democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm in this place to speak up for dignity, good work and rewarding jobs, for decent wages and safe conditions, for long-term employment that allows you to get a mortgage and provide for your family with certainty—the pathway to economic freedom. We must reject aggressive, value-neutral supply chains monopolising and using technology as a barbed wire chain around the throats of business and workers down the line.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to reference perhaps the greatest achievement of my life, solely because it was utterly unique in Australian political life. I have managed to receive a written apology from Senator Eric Abetz. Sure, Eric, the apology was in order to head off defamation proceedings. But, with Eric, one takes what one can get. I wish you could've gone to court, Senator. My mortgage could've used the relief. But, in fairness, I also appreciate the frank conversations I've had with Eric and other conservative workplace ministers over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
         What all these experiences and observations mean is that I entered parliament with broad perspectives. In my inaugural address, I'd like to share three of these.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first perspective is about what government's role should be in designing and regulating markets. Simply put, governments and parliaments must start leading with effective market design and regulation, rather than chasing with ineffective versions of neither. There are now modern, international goliaths in the information age, just as there were international behemoths in the first industrial and global trade ages. I speak of Uber, Amazon, Facebook, Google and their like—unaccountable titans who seek to have the market operate in their self-interest. The regulation of these global tech giants by democratically elected leaders is failing in our economy and our democracy. Governments need to catch up and get out in front of deregulating these disrupters, and my pledge in this place is that I will do everything in my power to thoughtfully and unapologetically disrupt the disrupters.
        </p>
        <p>
         We must tackle the tax relationship. We need to hold these global companies economically accountable so they can contribute their fair share of tax, like France is doing with its new three per cent digital services tax on revenue generated in its territory. France, like India, has had the courage to implement this simple, transparent tax—one which tackles head on the scourge of multinational tax avoidance. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         and a number of European countries are looking at this and other tax models, and it's time for Australia to do the same. I say that, as responsible legislators, we cannot wait for other countries to act. We cannot stand by and watch while our tax base is eroded and, with it, our ability to provide health, education and other critical infrastructure for our citizens.
        </p>
        <p>
         We must better define the regulatory relationship with these companies. We need real laws, not toothless voluntary codes, to ensure that all workers, consumers and small businesses have their rights, including data rights, protected and have a fair go in this emerging information economy. In saying this, I recognise all the good brought about by innovation, and I do welcome it. But regulating the transaction cost is our job, so let's get to it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Second, I have a perspective about the question this Senate must consider if we are to avoid the future of work being less utopia and more dystopia. I have watched the transport industry become ground zero for the impacts of a changing global economy and the massive technology driven disruption of firms like Uber, Foodora and Deliveroo. Make no mistake, this disruption is coming to every corner of our economy. The basic rights of working people are under threat from the gig economy, tech platforms, artificial intelligence and worker surveillance systems. Don't believe the spin. This is not a sharing economy. It's an on-demand economy, and it's incumbent on us to enforce and create rights for these workers. That includes the right to fair pay and superannuation. While the coalition nurtures wreckers of Australian world-leading superannuation, I believe we should extend superannuation to every worker in Australia, including those in the emerging gig economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the recent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Select Committee
         </a>
         on the Future of Work and Workers found, Australia has no coordinated approach to managing the future of work in Australia. I regard this fact alone as a very bright red-light risk for Australia. Ultimately, how can there be prosperity if we enter a world of permanently high unemployment and permanently higher underemployment?
        </p>
        <p>
         I also have a perspective on the dangers our body politic faces if a lack of political engagement further deepens the trust deficit. Whether it be the banks, the Catholic church, the parliament or the tax office—indeed, even the national cricket team lost the faith of our people for a period of time. What I see is an alarming loss of trust in institutions, some fraying of our social cohesion, and a growing sense that many institutions are more self-serving than selfless. In 2019, the Lowy Institute Poll found that 30 per cent of 18- to 29-year-olds said that, in some circumstances, a non-democratic government can be preferable. That's one in three young people. Polling carried out by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Museum" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Museum
         </a>
         of Democracy said that, if current trends continue, Australians' trust in their politicians and political institutions will drop to less than 10 per cent by 2025. Putting this in a commercial sense, a business with so little trust from consumers will simply go out of business. That cannot be the fate of our democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our parliamentarians generally have a lot of common ground, and it's a tragedy that the Australian public is not more aware of it. We need a parliamentary office to communicate the good bipartisan work that gets done here. I believe in plain speaking; in evidence-based policy; in less politics and more policy; and in governments and parliaments who lead and not follow—all underpinned by a core belief in the very decency, fairness and compassion my parents taught their children, Whilst I look forward to the ferocious debate, I utterly reject the notion of winning at all costs, because I believe in my duty to the people of New South Wales and of Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I wish to conclude with the final but most important acknowledgement: I want to thank all of the members of the Transport Workers' Union and every working person who has supported me for so many years. I say to every transport worker in Australia: because you are the men and women who carry Australia, you deserve the respect of all Australians. Some of you are no doubt listening on parliamentary radio as you drive a long haul on the Pacific, Sturt, Bruce or Eyre highways; some working late shifts at the airport, or sitting in the tearoom; and others just getting home, exhausted, to their waiting families. I want to say to these great men and women: it has been my honour to serve you. I'm here because of you, and, now more than ever, in this place I am your servant. To those families who have lost loved ones on the altar of profit, driven by greed or misused technology, or allowed by failed regulation: I remember every single one of you.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm honoured to be in this wonderful chamber, and determined to do good and to grasp the moment with everything I have. Thank you, senators; thank you, friends; thank you, family; and thank you, good President.

           The town of Yarrabah is a short drive from my home in Cairns. It is home to the Gunggandji people, a community of artists, activists, teachers and leaders. It is the place where elders, including Aunty Ruth and Uncle Alf, started to organise a campaign that built toward the 1967 referendum. They understood that the necessary ingredients for change were present in the Australian community and that they could, if they persisted, achieve reform and amend the constitution.

           , tonight I'm going talk to you about some of the incredible people who inspired me to become a Queensland senator. I was encouraged to run for public office by people who stand up for what they believe in, who speak up on behalf of others, those who encourage us tohope for the future and insist on making change. These are not the so-called quiet Australians. In fact, many of them are very noisy, and I truly believe that this is an important time to celebrate those in our community who don't remain silent when they witness injustice.
          </p>
          <p>
           Firstly, though, I want to say thank you to each and every Queenslander who I am very honoured to represent. After being elected I made this commitment to Queenslanders: in my role as a senator I will be, above all else, hardworking and incredibly grateful for the opportunity to serve my community. That work starts here and it starts now. I love Queensland and I love Queenslanders, so I feel incredibly lucky to be in this position at this time. I am even luckier to call Far North Queensland home.
          </p>
          <p>
           Queensland is rich in resources and opportunities. Our vast state consists of many communities, all with their own unique identity. And nothing unites us more than our dislike of people down south trying to tell us what to do and how to live.

            Exactly! Brisbane. When I leave this place I want to be able to say that Queensland has more apprentices and job opportunities for young people; has better schools, hospitals and aged-care facilities; has better roads, ports and major infrastructure; has a booming tourism industry; and is equipped to make the most out of the industries of the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that these are things that we can all work on together. We know there needs to be more money spent on big infrastructure and shovels in the ground now, in order to grow regional Queensland. But right now all we've got is a lot of promises. Further, the loss of 12,000 apprentices in Queensland means we are facing a skills shortage, which this government wants to address by expanding the skilled visa program. We want these projects built now and we want them built by local workers. In order to grow regional Queensland we also need to have some hard debates. I am ready to take on these debates and win them for Queensland.
           </p>
           <p>
            Job security for Queenslanders and the dangers of climate change are interlinked. Queenslanders want and deserve secure jobs. On this, let me be clear: whether it is a mine operator in Clermont, a tourism operator in Cairns, a farmer in Innisfail or a

            </a>
            , I will work to ensure that every Queenslander has a genuine role in securing the future of the jobs that feed their families and help create the communities that they call home.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only way to win an outcome that ensures a prosperous and healthy future for our state is to listen to Queenslanders, not talk at them or speak about them in abstract terms. Every regional Queenslander deserves to be treated with respect. Listening to and respecting Queenslanders is what I have been doing, and it is what I will continue to do as their elected representative in this Senate.

            Our community is made up of many types of Australians. We've heard a great deal about quiet Australians of late—what they believe; what they want their government to do. We are told they are defined by what they are not. They're not noisy. They don't criticise. And we are told they don't really have time for politics, which I don't think is entirely true. It seems to me a false value is being placed on being not just quiet but passive or disinterested in politics. It's a view that dismisses Australians who are concerned with what goes on here, who are outspoken, who stand up and make change. History has shown us, time and time again, that we should encourage debate and dissent. In fact, it is dangerous not to. Despite the divisive politics around the world, you'll often hear young people talk about the importance of hope and change. During past times of upheaval and uncertainty, others have often spoken about these ideas.

            hopeful of change. A fragment of that speech was later recited by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy" rel="nofollow">
             Ted Kennedy
            </a>
            during the eulogy that he delivered for his brother. With his voice breaking, and in spite of the uncertainty of the time, he chose the passages of Kennedy's speech about hope and the ability of one person, and particularly young people, to make great change. Kennedy said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change a small portion of the events, and in the total of all these acts will be written the history of this generation.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            …   …   …
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It is from numberless diverse acts of courage such as these that the belief that human history is thus shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Ted Kennedy delivered those words he was the same age as I am right now. He stood in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
             St Patrick's Cathedral
            </a>
            , having just lost two of his brothers, and yet he spoke about hope and insisting on change. Yes, we should respect our quiet Australians, but there will always be a place for people who choose not to remain silent and instead stand up for an ideal to improve the lot of others or strike out against injustice. We also need vocal Australians to inspire us, to lead us and to prepare us for the changes ahead.
           </p>
           <p>
            The advancement of women's equality and empowerment has been shaped by some very noisy women. I am here today because of the strong noisy women who fought for the right to vote, for equal pay, for equal work and for greater representation in parliament. This includes Senator Claire Moore, who worked tirelessly to give a voice to the voiceless. Now there is a new generation of strong women ready to demand more changes and greater equality. So thank you to all of the strong young women of the Labor Party who inspire me and give me so much strength, especially Jess, Laura, Jo and Alana. I also want to make special mention of two noisy women, Ellie Whitaker and Emily Brogan, who have supported me on every step in this journey.
           </p>
           <p>
            My mum is also a strong woman, and without her I wouldn't be here today. Despite the disapproval of her parents, my mum married my dad who was 20 years her senior. Mum was a nurse in an operating theatre, and, like most nurses I meet, she is smart and tough and incredibly hard working. Her primary purpose and concern is always the welfare of others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dad was charming and intelligent. He worked hard on night shifts. He was a printer at Fairfax. I knew that he had an important job, because he got the news out. He was a big man, and as a kid you could bury your head into his shoulder and feel protected. I loved him very much. But he was also an alcoholic and he suffered from depression. He was cruel when he was sober and he was abusive when he was drunk. He was supposed to protect us, but no-one protected us from him.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I was three or four years old, my mum left in the middle of the night—me walking along side my brother in a stroller and our bags on our backs. When I asked her why we were walking the long way around the block, she said, 'So daddy doesn't see us.' Leaving, finally, for good, almost 10 years later, was the best decision my mum ever made. We were homeless for the first few nights after we left, because the rental that mum paid for wasn't liveable. Tragically, domestic violence remains one of the biggest drivers of homelessness for Australian women. We finally settled in a small community of town houses occupied by families on minimum-wage jobs, single parents and new migrants. Mum packed shelves at night to make ends meet.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no doubt that it was hard for mum to leave. She shouldn't have had to do it on her own, but, like so many women, she did. For all the struggle that life of a single mother would bring, every day I was so grateful to be safe. It made who I am today—tough, resilient and unwilling to accept that some Australians have to settle for less just because of where they were born or who their parents are.
           </p>
           <p>
            One in five women in Australia has experienced family violence. Sadly, hospitalisation rates as a result of family violence are on the rise. Family violence is a health crisis and a cultural crisis, and it has to stop. We can't be hopeful or well-meaning anymore; we must demand that it changes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mum gave me many gifts throughout my life: a safe home, self-belief and the understanding that tough times don't last forever. She has three rules in life: you have to be home on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve" rel="nofollow">
             Christmas Eve

            , never ride a motorcycle—she's a nurse—and never ever cross a picket line. So, on top of all of the other gifts she gave me, she made me a good trade unionist.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a young person who always felt that a country as rich as Australia should look after our most vulnerable first, I was naturally drawn to the trade union movement. Being a union member is about making noise, because being in a union makes your voice much louder. The hopes, rights and voices of a single worker are amplified through our collectivism. Unionism is the personification of those tiny ripples of hope Robert F Kennedy spoke about. It is the coming together and the knocking down of the walls of oppression, injustice and greed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Queensland Trades and Labour Council worked alongside the elders in Yarrabah in the lead-up to the 1967 referendum because they saw injustice and oppression in the conditions and the discrimination faced by Indigenous communities. As a union lawyer, campaigner and industrial officer, I've met many Queenslanders who have been subjected to exploitation, wage theft and workplace safety breaches and have faced discrimination in the workplace. Without union representation and the support and solidarity of their workmates, these workers would have had little to no chance of achieving a fair and just outcome.

            I note that Senator Sheldon has been in the party since he was 14 years old. When I was younger I didn't plan to come to politics, but in 2011 at the national conference the

            inspired me to be part of change. I wasn't a member or a volunteer at the time, but I got to witness the robust debate on the Barr-Wong amendment that led to marriage equality becoming part of the party platform. In speaking to her amendment Senator Wong said something that resonates with me to this day. She said, 'Equality does not diminish the worth of your relationships; it simply recognises the worth of ours.' Meanwhile, the member for Sydney,

            , spoke of Labor's preparedness to examine itself and move forward. Albo articulated how Labor would take up the fight for the elimination of all discrimination—be it based on race, gender or class. When the vote was finalised, the then

            national president, Senator McAllister, simply said the words, 'I declare the amendment carried.' From that moment onwards, I saw a place for me in the Labor Party because I also believed in fairness and equality. Labor, not only a party of government but in government, held the same view.

            Seven years later, as a member of the Labor Party, I took all the hurt and fear that I felt about the same-sex marriage plebiscite and threw myself into campaigning for marriage equality. In my role organising volunteers in Brisbane and throughout Queensland, I had the chance to meet so many wonderful people. They were gay, straight, old and young and all they wanted to do was fight for change. They were the tiny little ripples that created a giant wave of support.

            One of those volunteers stands out the most. A few days after voting closed, I organised an event to thank our volunteers. Amongst the rainbow flags and streamers, I spotted a man wearing a

I hugged him, feeling proud of the work we'd done and relief that we had saved his life. But there was also white, hot anger—anger about the lives that we couldn't save; anger about the number of

            In the end, Queensland—my Queensland—voted 60.7 per cent for yes. From Coolangatta to the cape, Queensland said yes to equality and love. I want to acknowledge Rainbow Labor and my friends from the Equality Campaign. I am very proud to know you all. Thank you Joseph, Patrick, Georgia and the rest of the team. And thank you to

            I am very thankful for the work that many in this place did to achieve marriage equality. I acknowledge Senator Dean Smith especially and Senator Wong, Senator Louise Pratt and Senator Janet Rice and the other champions and allies we have in this house. In the end, no single party or politician delivered marriage equality. The victory belonged to many Australians, and I want to acknowledge the LGBTI activists who worked for decades. They spoke out not only when it was unpopular but when it was unthinkable. I want to acknowledge all of the allies who had never fought before but marched with us. They wrapped their arms around us when we needed it the most. Australians showed that, collectively, they can be powerful and vocal and respectful and loving. We demanded change and we got it.

            Before I finish, I want to say thank you to my friends and family who travelled here today. A special thank you to my oldest friends, the ones who knew me before politics and still put up with me afterwards, especially Jackie and Jess. Thank you, Ben, for your help, advice and chocolate runs. Thank you to my colleagues in this place new and old, and a special thanks to Senator Murray Watt, who I met at my first campaign meeting. Who would have thought we'd be here now? Thank you for your friendship, humour and advice. Thank you to my wife's family for making me feel so at home. Thank you Vicki and Warren, who couldn't be here tonight, but I know they send their love. Thank you to my mum and my brother, Rohan, for everything you have done for me.

            During the recent election campaign, Mum would text me out of the blue and say something along the lines of: 'Are you on the bus today? How is Penny?' At the same time, I discovered I had a strange new Twitter follower. I put two and two together and discovered that my mum had created a Twitter account just to follow what I was doing on the campaign, which made me realise, of course, that I was being a very bad daughter. Mum, I promise to tweet a little less, to call a little more and to make you proud every day.

            Finally, to my wife, Lacey: Lacey is funny, sweet and wise. She is the coolest person I know. She's a teacher, a designer and a very good cook. Life with Lacey is always an adventure: she's either taking you on one or she is happy to come along on yours. Our lives have changed in so many ways since we met. I am proud of her, and she is proud of me. Thank you, honey, for your support today and every day and the huge sacrifices that you will make now and into the future. I love you very much.

            The elders in Yarrabah, with all of the barriers that stood before them, refused to take no for an answer. The union movement in Cairns stood beside them and fought for change, as they have done now for over 200 years. Sometimes this parliament lags behind the momentum for change that builds in our community. It was true of marriage equality; it is true of constitutional recognition. That's why we need Australians who stand up and speak out. If you are a young Australian and you want to change our country and make it better, you can. Never give up, join your union and don't be afraid to make some noise. Thank you.
