        My question is for the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Minister Farrell. The government has updated the THRIVE 2030 strategy to invest in and increase the visitor economy in Australia. In this document, there's considerable mention of increasing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        tourism sector, which is welcomed. However, it's important that when we invest in First Nations tourism we ensure that our cultural heritage is protected and First Nations people are beneficiaries of this investment, especially considering the recommendations of the Juukan report. My question is: how will THRIVE 2030 protect First Nations cultural heritage as the First Nations tourism sector grows?

         I thank Senator Cox for her question. I know, particularly based on my frequent discussions with her, just how important this issue is to her and just how important getting this part of our tourism sector right is to the country generally. The revised THRIVE 2030 project was relaunched in Sydney a couple of weeks ago with all of Australia's trade ministers, including, interestingly enough, both the Liberal trade minister and the incoming Labor trade minister.

         This government is all about improving the lives of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         in particular. As you know, we're promoting the recognition of Indigenous Australians through a voice to parliament. In a sense, everything else flows from that commitment, because what it means is that, as a government, we see the opportunity of not only improving the lives of Indigenous Australians, through greater tourism focused on the Indigenous experience, but also projecting to the world this government's commitment to Indigenous issues. In all of the discussions that I have with companies overseas, we promote Indigenous tourism as a unique aspect of the Australian tourism experience. I'm extremely hopeful that, based on the revised THRIVE 2030, we can build on what we were already doing in this space—

            (—) (): I thank Senator Cox for her first supplementary question. The focus of the government, in terms of our trade strategy, has been one of diversification. We've learnt from bitter experience that putting all of your eggs in one basket, whether it be tourism or trade or education, has some real downside risks when there's a change to the economic circumstances of the aspect of the economy that you've devoted your resources to. By promoting Indigenous tourism in this country, and by promoting the experience that people overseas can get by engaging in that Indigenous experience, we think that's part of our overall diversification—

               I thank Senator Cox for her second supplementary question. I don't think there's a government in this country more committed to raising and promoting the issues of Indigenous tourism in this country. It's not just because it's the right thing to do; there's actually an economic advantage. In the post-pandemic world, every country is trying to get some aspect of their tourism experience to attract tourists back to their country. This offers a real opportunity for Australia to have a unique offering which will achieve all of the—
