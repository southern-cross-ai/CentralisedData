          I rise today to call on the Senate to pay tribute to our heroes. This motion asks the government to issue a commemorative medal for the centenary of the Anzacs' landing at Gallipoli. The purpose of this is both to honour the sacrifice of the original Anzacs and to remind us all that our service people today are the worthy inheritors of the Anzac tradition. This medal was proposed to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott back in 2015, but the unique opportunity to commemorate the Anzacs was missed. We need to change that. I hope the Senate will join with me in reaffirming our commitment to support Anzac Day and support the issuing of this Centenary of Anzac commemorative medal to honour the veterans and the brave men and women of our

             personnel. As part of the Centenary of Anzac, the government delivered a large program of commemorations, including activities both here in Australia and internationally. Defence Force personnel have been actively involved in these commemoration activities, which continue this year. They are an appropriate way to commemorate this significant anniversary in our nation's history. However, while the government appreciates the intent behind the creation of a commemorative medal, we have no plans to create such a medal at this time. As such, we oppose part (d) of the motion and ask that the question on this part be put separately from the question on the other parts.

                Labor supports the recognition of our current and former service personnel and the importance of participating in Anzac Day commemorations. It is right that we remember all those who have served our nation under the values of our Anzacs: courage, endurance, mateship and sacrifice. However, Labor cannot support the senator's call to create a medal of remembrance for those personnel who served during the Centenary of Anzac. Labor believes that medals are to recognise our service personnel's service and sacrifice to our country, and not to mark a point in time of their enlistment.

                   personnel, as much as we respect our Defence Force personnel. We believe it is not a day for whipping up nationalism. I would point out to Senator Anning that we spent hundreds of millions of dollars around the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Anzac Day two years ago, when you weren't here. A number of veterans made it very clear that they thought that was a waste of money. They thought the money should have gone to supporting veterans who have served this country, rather than wasting it on attempts by this conservative government to whip up nationalism around the commemoration of Anzac Day. My father is a Vietnam vet, and his father and grandfathers were all war veterans; I know he is ambivalent about Anzac Day, as are lots of Australians. As much as anything else, it's a day to reflect on the horrors of war, the sadness that comes with war and the generations that have to bear that burden, and lest we forget that.

                    Just to clarify: I will be putting clauses (a) to (c) of motion No. 777 in the first instance before I put clause (d) separately. So the question is that clauses (a) to (c) of motion No. 777 be agreed to.
