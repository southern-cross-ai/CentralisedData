        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and

         I thank Senator Martin, the Nationals senator for Tasmania, for this very important question. I can say with great confidence: there is no greater advocate for regional Tasmania than Senator Martin. There is no greater friend to regional Tasmania than the coalition government. The government, on this side of the chamber, is 100 per cent focused on delivering more secure jobs and a stronger economy for those who call regional Australia home.

           From Latrobe to Longford, Smithton to Scottsdale, the government have a national economic plan, and we are focused on getting it done. And, can I say, there is not a day that goes by that Senator Martin isn't fighting and advocating to make life better for all Tasmanians.

                 A key pillar of the coalition's plan is to deliver vital social and economic infrastructure in regional communities across the nation through the successful Building Better Regions Fund. I know members on this side were absolutely delighted when Minister McVeigh recently unveiled the second round of the BBRF projects. I'm very proud that we're investing more than $5 million in seven critical community projects around regional Tasmania. They're going to create more jobs and opportunities and build local economies. These are projects that those opposite would never fund, not in a pink fit. In this round alone, across the nation more than 240 projects will be delivering some 10,000 jobs. That's 10,000 families spending more and investing more in their local community, knowing that they are a fundamental partner in the coalition government's nation-building, jobs-growing agenda.

                    Indeed I can. Like I indicated in my earlier answer, this government is delivering critical, job-creating social and economic infrastructure projects across regional Tasmania and right across regional Australia, which, again as I indicated, those opposite will never understand. In fact, even if those opposite cared about our regions, which they don't, they simply couldn't afford to fund these types of nation-building projects.

                    In Tasmania we'll invest $2.5 million in Ulverstone to construct their museum and gallery complex, the science centre and planetarium. This project will absolutely transform the town to be a boon to the entire

                    , and create opportunities to foster local Indigenous art and culture. This government will always invest in the peoples and communities of Australia, unlike those opposite, who want to tax the nation into oblivion.

                      I thank the minister for his answers. Could the minister advise the Senate how round 2 of the Building Better Regions Fund is supporting the coalition government's commitment to delivering jobs and a stronger economy for all those who live, work and invest in regional Tasmania?

                       but for rural communities around the great state of Tasmania. These projects are delivering jobs and growth, and making them even better places to live, to work and to invest.

                       In Huonville we're investing $847,500 to develop the Huon Valley Integrated Health Hub. There's $1.3 million for the Northbourne Park Retirement Village stage 2. In Murdunna we're constructing a 90-metre-deep jetty with floating pontoon mooring for berthing of deep draught vessels. These are the types of strategic and targeted investments a government can make when it has its priorities right and when it actually runs an economy that can afford them. These are projects and communities that, sadly, those opposite and their completely hopeless colleagues in the other place—the members for Braddon, Lyons, Franklin and Bass—have never cared about and probably never will.
