        My question is to Senator Brandis, Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I refer the minister to reports on the

         Senator Gallacher, I thank you for that question. No deal has been done in relation to Australia's future submarine fleet. No deal has been done, Senator Gallacher, and no decision has been made.

          , on a point of order, I am aware that the minister does have some time but he was sitting down so quickly, I thought I had better get in quickly. The question was: 'Do such documents exist?' I draw his attention to the question.

           By inference, I think the minister is answering the question by indicating that no such deal has been done. But, equally, Senator Wong, you are right; the minister does have one minute and 42 seconds left to answer the question.

               No deal has been done. No decision has been made. What the government has announced is that there will be a competitive evaluation process to select an international partner to develop the next generation of Australian submarines.
              </p>
              <p>
               I must say, Senator Gallacher, I find this more than curious coming from you, a Labor senator—this new-found interest in the Australia submarine project, which was allowed to lie in abeyance for the entire six years of your Labor government.
              </p>
              <p>
               For six years, you did nothing. Your party did nothing. Through successive defence ministers, the future submarine lay in the too-hard basket because not one of your ministers whether it was

               was prepared to make a decision. This government has made a decision to progress the future Australian submarine. No decision has been made as to the international partner. A decision will be made as a result of the competitive evaluation process that was announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. The various bidding countries, whether they be Japan or France or Germany, will be appraised and are being appraised. But Senator Gallacher, you sat on your hands for six years and did nothing.

                    and no decision has been made. I do not know how many times I have to tell you that, Senator Gallacher. You know what the Prime Minister and Mr Andrews announced. You are aware of the competitive evaluation process. You know that the government has said that Australia will need to engage an international partner to pick up where you left off. Senator Gallacher, your side of politics, through three defence ministers and three successive prime ministers, left a capability gap in one of Australia's most important strategic capabilities. You should be ashamed of yourself.

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer Senator Brandis to Peter Hartcher's article in
                      <i>
                       The
                      </i>

                      </i>
                      on 20 February about the submarine debacle where he quotes an Abbott government minister saying:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There was a headlong rush to be best buddies with Abe … and we've been backfilling ever since.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Isn't the government's sham process for Australia's future submarines designed only to deliver a decision already made in secret by the government?

                        I have already answered the substance of the question. Senator Gallacher, you talk about a debacle; how is this for a debacle—a government that gets elected in 2007 knowing there is a need to progress to the next generation of Australian submarine after the last Labor debacle of the Collins class submarine and then goes on for six years and does precisely nothing across three defence ministers and three prime ministers knowing with each successive year that the capability gap in this vital strategic asset is growing and growing and growing. I do not know, Senator Gallacher, how more simply I can put this to you. For six years you did nothing, not a thing to progress the next generation of the Australian submarine. This government inherited that debacle from you and we are determined to ensure we get the best deal.
