         The Inquiry
        </a>
        lapsed following the dissolution of the Senate (44th Parliament) on 9 May 2016, for the general election on 2 July 2016.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 11 October 2016, the Senate agreed to the Committee's recommendation that the Inquiry be re-adopted in the 45th Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 13 October 2016, as part of its broader Inquiry into non-conforming building products, the Committee adopted additional terms of reference seeking submissions regarding the unlawful importation of products containing asbestos, and their impact on the health and safety of the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Submissions to the Inquiry closed on 18 January 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the Grenfell Tower fire in London, on 21 June 2017, the then Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, the Hon Craig Laundy MP, wrote to the Chair of the Committee, Senator Chris Ketter, to request the Inquiry be used to conduct a public hearing to specifically examine the non-compliant use of cladding products in Australia.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        agreed to prepare an additional interim report on the implications of the use of non-compliant external cladding materials in Australia as a priority. That report was released on 6 September 2017 and the Government's response was tabled on 14 February 2018.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reporting date for the interim report on asbestos was 22 November 2017 and the reporting date for the final Inquiry report is 16

         IDC
        </a>
        ) to provide strategic direction to enable effective policy and regulatory coordination across Commonwealth agencies in managing asbestos issues across the supply chain.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has progressed a range of initiatives to improve supply chain management and assurance pre, at and post border. The Australian Border Force (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABF" rel="nofollow">
         ABF
        </a>
        ) is managing goods that pose a risk of containing asbestos through a substantial increase in the targeting and testing of goods at the border.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government agencies are also actively working with importers and industry to ensure they understand the requirements and their responsibilities under import laws. This includes the need to put in place assurance measures across the supply chain to ensure that asbestos does not reach Australia in the first place.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australian Government agencies are also working together with state and territory WHS regulators to address incidents of unlawfully imported asbestos being installed in a workplace. Consideration is being given to the powers of inspectors to require the removal of the asbestos in this circumstance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commonwealth, state and territory governments have also established mechanisms to respond rapidly to the identification of unlawful asbestos importations, to prevent these goods from posing a risk to the community. A Rapid Response Protocol ensures that relevant government agencies share information and facilitate communication to the community about the safe handling and disposal of imported goods containing asbestos.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the importance of maintaining a strict prohibition on the import and use of asbestos and will continue to work collaboratively with all levels of government, industry and the community to address this issue.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The existing coordinated and consistent approach to addressing the unlawful importation of asbestos and appropriate mechanisms has strong support from all levels of government in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The responsibilities of Commonwealth, state and territory agencies are clear in relation to the prevention, detection and management of imports, which unlawfully contain asbestos. There is an effective regulatory framework in place, underpinned by a range of laws across the import supply chain at the Commonwealth, state and territory levels in the areas of public health, environment, WHS, importation, building regulation and consumer law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has established a range of policy and regulatory coordination mechanisms at ministerial and senior executive levels to ensure a coordinated and systematic approach across this framework. Commonwealth, state and territory ministers and senior officials responsible for WHS regularly meet to progress WHS issues, including asbestos-related issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Asbestos IDC, which the Department of Jobs and Small Business and the Department of Home Affairs established in September 2016, provides strategic direction to enable effective policy and regulatory coordination across Commonwealth agencies in managing asbestos issues across the supply chain. The Asbestos IDC brings together Commonwealth agencies responsible for WHS, border protection, trade, environmental protection, public health and consumer safety. ASEA is also on the Asbestos IDC. The work of the Asbestos IDC has involved clarifying roles and responsibilities and identifying opportunities to strengthen the legislative framework. The Asbestos IDC undertakes consultation with employers and unions.

        responsible for asbestos matters. The Working Group has established a Rapid Response Protocol to address instances of unlawfully imported asbestos, with communication channels to enable a swift response to contain and appropriately deal with those instances within Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        SWA, the national agency on work health and safety policy, also supports a coordinated and consistent approach to the regulation of asbestos in the workplace. SWA comprises membership from the Commonwealth, all states and territories, employers and unions. The model WHS laws, for which SWA is responsible, deal comprehensively with asbestos in the workplace, including through the implementation of a domestic ban on its use.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia has had a ban on the unauthorised manufacture, use, reuse, import, transport, storage or sale of all forms of asbestos and asbestos-containing materials since 31 December 2003. The ban was introduced under Commonwealth, state and territory work health and safety legislation and is complemented by import and export prohibitions under the
        <i>
         Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956
        </i>
        (Cth) and the
        <i>
         Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958

        (Cth).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Regulation 4C of the
        <i>
         Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956
        </i>
        (Cth) prohibits the importation of asbestos, or goods containing asbestos, except in very limited circumstances, such as where the Minister administering the
        <i>
         Work Health and Safety Act 2011
        </i>
        (Cth)has provided permission to import asbestos for the purpose of research, analysis or display. Regulation 4 of the
        <i>
         Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958
        </i>
        (Cth) prohibits the exportation of asbestos, or certain goods containing asbestos, from Australia unless a permission or exemption has been granted or a lawful exception applies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted in the response to Recommendation 15, the Department of Home Affairs is developing advice to government on changes to the offences and penalties for the unlawful import/export of asbestos detailed in customs legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Departments of Jobs and Small Business and Home Affairs are also considering amendments to the
        <i>
         Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956
        </i>
        (Cth) and
        <i>
         Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1956
        </i>
        (Cth) at the recommendation of the Asbestos IDC
        <i>
         .
        </i>
        The proposed changes would improve consistency of the regulations with the model WHS laws and make other necessary updates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted in the response to Recommendation 20, SWA is currently reviewing the power of regulators to deal with the removal and disposal of asbestos that has been unlawfully imported and then used in workplaces.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The comprehensive and coordinated approach the Government is taking to the enforcement and management of Australia's strict import/export prohibition and workplace ban on asbestos means that additional work through the Council of Australian Governments (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">

       <p class="italic">
        The Government provided ASEA with additional ongoing funding of $1.7 million per annum, commencing in 2018â€“19, in the 2017 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO). This more than doubles ASEA's base level of funding, from $1.6 million, to $3.3 million per annum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The additional funding ensures ASEA can work effectively with state, territory and Commonwealth WHS regulators to implement the National Strategic Plan for Asbestos Management and Awareness to protect workers and the community from Australia's deadly asbestos legacy, as well as achieving an end to asbestos-related disease.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The funding will ensure that ASEA is well placed to coordinate the implementation of phase two of the National Strategic Plan with Comcare, the states and territories. The funding ensures the Agency can maintain an appropriate level of staffing and conduct research in priority areas to support effective policy and programs that reduce exposure to asbestos.

       <p class="italic">
        An independent review of border processes for asbestos concluded in 2016. This review examined industry engagement undertaken at the time, and it identified opportunities for organisational and technical improvements. Following the review, there has been an increased focus on formalised consultation and engagement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Home Affairs continues to enhance and update the information it publishes with respect to asbestos, and it engages directly with key stakeholders via a number of internal and external consultation fora, including through:

        The Department of Home Affairs' efforts complement those of other agencies, including through ASEA's work in driving a national focus on health and safety issues on asbestos. ASEA has broad stakeholder reach, including with state and territory regulators, unions, industry associations and asbestos support groups.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Asbestos IDC coordinates a whole-of-government approach to the consultation and engagement that occurs with relevant stakeholders. The recommended external review of industry consultation arrangements would likely result in a duplication of effort given the current work of the Asbestos IDC and ASEA, and the 2016 independent review already undertaken.

        The ABF requires importers to have adequate assurance measures in place to demonstrate that the goods they are importing do not contain asbestos. The types of measures an importer may put in place may include, but are not exclusive to, testing. Assurance can include a combination of processes, such as the identification and removal of at-risk components before import (for example, brake pads in vehicles), which would remove the necessity to test; collation of evidence through demonstrated knowledge of the supply chain (including the manufacturing process) and building assurances into contractual arrangements with suppliers.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers that existing guidance on due diligence for importers, and the mandatory requirements under WHS laws, are already sufficient.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example, the model WHS laws in place in a majority of jurisdictions require a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of workers it engages, directs or influences, relevant to dealing with the risks posed by unlawfully imported asbestos. These duties include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        PCBUs that design, manufacture, import or supply plant, structures or substances have specific 'upstream duties' under the model WHS laws. This reflects their ability to influence the safety of these products before they are used in the workplace. These PCBUs have a duty to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that their products are without risk to health and safety when used at a workplace. This duty extends throughout the entire lifecycle of that product.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An officer of a PCBU is required to exercise due diligence to ensure that the PCBU complies with duties and obligations. It is unlikely that further regulation will achieve a measurable improvement in the issue of illegal asbestos importation.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ACCC is the national consumer product safety regulator responsible for jointly administering and enforcing the ACL with state and territory consumer affairs agencies under a 'one law, multiple regulator model'. The ACCC takes a hazard and risk-based approach to intervention in consumer product safety matters. In addition to compulsory recalls, the ACL provides for a range of graduated regulatory interventions to address consumer product safety-related issues, including voluntary recalls of consumer goods and safety warning notices.

       <p class="italic">
        Compulsory recalls

        ) requires the Minister to issue a proposed recall notice. The proposed recall notice must include an invitation for anyone who supplies, or proposes to supply the consumer goods to request the ACCC to hold a conference in relation to the proposed recall notice (section 132A(3)(e)). However, if it appears to the Commonwealth Minister that the consumer goods create an imminent risk of death, serious illness or serious injury, a recall notice can be issued without delay under section 132J of the CCA.

The ACCC monitored the effectiveness of these recalls.

        Safety warning notice

        The ACL also provides for the responsible minister to publish a safety warning notice to the public about possible product-related risks to consumers (section 129 (1)). Safety warning notices have been published in relation to a number of product safety-related issues, including 'fire wallets' due to identified asbestos content and more recently for Polaris youth quad bikes where certain parts of some models may contain asbestos.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Once the investigation has been completed and a proposed ban notice or a proposed recall notice or a recall notice without delay has not been published or issued, the responsible minister must, as soon as practicable after the completion of the investigation, publish the results of the investigation (section 130(1) of the ACL).

        The ACCC does not consider that there is merit in publishing a statement of reasons if it determines not to recommend that the Commonwealth Minister issue a compulsory recall notice for consumer goods containing asbestos. This is because there would already be a voluntary recall or other risk communication and risk management strategy in place, meaning suppliers would be taking satisfactory action to meet their obligations to prevent those goods from causing injury to any person. A safety warning notice may also be in place. These interventions would seek to address the hazard and publicly inform consumers about any safety risks, therefore a statement of reasons would have no useful application.

        The ACCC prioritises the assessment of product safety issues, which have the potential to cause serious harm to consumers.

Where the ACCC has become aware of asbestos containing materials in consumer goods, it has publicly reported this to consumers.
       </p>

        The ACCC has in place monitoring procedures to ensure that appropriate further action can be taken where this is warranted.

        The language of the recommendation suggests a broad scope, potentially covering Australia's considerable asbestos legacy, although this Inquiry's focus on asbestos has been on unlawful imports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ASEA and the Department of Home Affairs both provide lists on their websites of goods that could contain asbestos. The asbestos-containing materials in both lists may already exist in the built environment as legacy asbestos, or they may exist in goods that could be unlawfully imported into Australia in the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the ACCC publishes recall notices of unlawful imports that have been specifically identified. This information provides the public, importers, and others in the supply chain with the necessary information on products that may potentially contain asbestos.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government focuses on preventing the unlawful importation of goods containing asbestos and the ABF has significantly increased its efforts to target unlawful importation. The ABF continues to refine profiles and alerts to target asbestos, based on factors such as the nature of the goods, country of origin, overseas suppliers and importers of concern. However, sharing the details of these profiles, which could include information provided for other purposes, would not only raise privacy concerns, but would be counter-productive as suppliers may seek to protect their sales market in Australiaâ€”such as by changing their commercial operationsâ€”to counteract targeting of their goods at the Australian border.

        The model WHS Regulations developed by SWA and enacted by the Commonwealth and a majority of states and territories, require preparation of an asbestos register where asbestos is identified at the workplace, or is likely to be present from time to time. The register must record the location, type and condition of the asbestos, must be regularly maintained, and be readily accessible by workers, their WHS representatives and others who carry out work in that workplace. This means that there is already a record of, and relevant information about, asbestos at a workplace for persons who may be affected by its presence. This ensures that the relevant people are aware of asbestos in the workplace and there is no additional benefit in making this information publicly available.

Developing and maintaining a national register would be costly and time consuming, and make a questionable contribution to the management of asbestos given the range of measures already in place.
