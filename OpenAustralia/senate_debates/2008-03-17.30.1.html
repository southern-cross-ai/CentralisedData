        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Can the minister indicate whether the Rudd government will establish an independent judicial inquiry into the illegal activities of the

         I thank the senator for his question. I indicate to him that allegations of any sort of impropriety in electoral funding should be directed either to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Electoral Commission
         </a>
         or the relevant state electoral authority. Those are the appropriate authorities to investigate any improprieties. It is the position we took in opposition and it is the position we take in government.

           I join with Senator Abetz in arguing this case. As you recall, Senator Abetz, when Senator Brown raised concerns about the funding of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_Brethren" rel="nofollow">
            Exclusive Brethren
           </a>
           we argued very strenuously then that the appropriate authority to investigate any concerns was the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Electoral Commission
           </a>
           . That is what should occur. In terms of allegations of criminal conduct, those concerns should be directed to either the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Federal Police
           </a>
           or the appropriate state police service. All senators are well aware that those are the appropriate avenues to take when dealing with serious allegations. So in answer to the senator’s question, the answer is no. We are suggesting that any concerns be raised directly with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
            AEC
           </a>
           or the relevant state electoral authority and that any suggestions of criminal conduct should be directed to the Australian Federal Police or the appropriate state police service.

             AEC
            </a>
            does not have the powers of a judicial inquiry and cannot recommend criminal charges, why won’t the Rudd government commit to a full, open, accountable and independent judicial inquiry into this scandal? Further, given it is now clear that the Rudd government is totally beholden to the union movement, will the government immediately support the Senate’s reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters?

             I thank the senator for the supplementary. I do not really have much to say other than what I said in answer to the original question because the supp was more about trying to make some sort of the slur. As I indicated to the chamber in answer to the first inquiry, if there are concerns about criminal activity they should not go to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
              AEC
             </a>
             , no, they should go straight to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
              AFP
             </a>
             or the state police authorities. That is the appropriate response. So if there are concerns about electoral funding they ought to be referred straight to the AEC. If there are concerns about any sort of criminal activity, it would be beholden on people to refer those to the AFP or the state police authorities. As you are well aware, those are the appropriate responses if concerns exist.
