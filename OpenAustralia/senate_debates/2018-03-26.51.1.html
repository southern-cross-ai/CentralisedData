         , for that question. I will just start off by saying that Australia's population is ageing, and the government has had to make some tough decisions to ensure the age pension remains sustainable and supports those most in need. The

          2015
         </i>
         <i>
          Intergenerational report
         </i>
         identified that, for every person aged 65 and over, the number of people of traditional working age—being 16 to 64 years old—had fallen from 7.3 people in 1974-75 to an estimated 4.5 people today. By 2054-55, this is projected to nearly halve again to only 2.7 people. Since the coalition formed government in 2013, pensions have increased by $86 a fortnight for singles and about $130 a fortnight for couples.

           The question went to the fairness of the Turnbull government wanting to make Australians work until they're 70 while they're giving a $65 billion handout. We haven't heard anything about the Turnbull government's decision to raise the age of retirement to 70.

               As I was saying, the member for Fenner provided us with this little gem. In an opinion piece entitled 'You're only as old as they feel', he suggested that:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               A better approach would be to index upper age limits in all laws …

               …   …   …

              <p class="italic">
               How might age indexation operate in practice? One approach would be to mandate that all elderly age limits should increase by 3 months every year …
              </p>
              <p>
               So it's rather hypocritical—

                   In relation to the pension supplement, it is a payment designed to assist income support recipients with the cost of living in Australia. There is no economic reason to continue to compensate recipients for the impact of

                   for any time longer than a short absence. The pension supplement will be aligned with the portability arrangements of most other income support payments, which cease at six weeks—

                     I hope we can get an answer that is relevant this time. Given the coalition government has cut the pension indexation, cut $1 billion from pensioner concessions, axed the $900 senior supplement and cut the pension to around 370,000 pensioners, why won't the Turnbull government end its attacks on pensioners before it gives big business a $65 billion tax cut?

                      The Turnbull government is committed to ensuring that Australia's welfare system provides appropriate support to those in need while remaining sustainable for future generations. This is a very simple measure. We repealed the carbon tax and so we repealed the compensation that went with it. It is simply not sustainable to continue to compensate people who have not yet even entered the welfare system for a tax that no longer exists. Had the carbon tax not been repealed in 2014, it would have caused long-term increases in electricity prices. When the carbon tax was repealed on 1 July 2014, the
