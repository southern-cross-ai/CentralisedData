        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Prime Minister's conflicting statements about building Australia's offshore patrol vessels. In Adelaide the Prime Minister said construction of our future naval fleet would be centred in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . In Melbourne the Prime Minister said the construction would most likely start in South Australia but could move to Melbourne. Last week the Prime Minister said that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        could bid for these vessels, an in the other place today he said that the patrol vessels may be moved from Adelaide in 2020. Which is it, minister? Will you give us a straight answer: where will these ships be built?

         Senator Conroy, the future frigates will be built in Adelaide. The offshore patrol vessels will be built in Australia, primarily in Adelaide, but other localities in Australia will be at liberty to bid for the offshore patrol vessels. As a result of the competitive evaluation process, later in the year the government is proposing to announce the construction of the future submarine program, but there will be very, very substantial work in Adelaide for the future submarine program. I must say, Senator Conroy, that your chutzpah really is extraordinary. You were a minister in a government that did nothing for Australian naval shipbuilding for six years—nothing. Not a single Australian naval ship was commenced in the six years during which you sat around the cabinet table—not one. Not one single Australian warship was commenced. The Future Submarine program was delayed and put off for over six years. As a result, what has been referred to in the industry as the valley of death, the point between the end of work on pre-existing programs begun by the Howard government and the uptake of work on programs introduced by the Abbott government—

             , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the government's first decision in naval shipbuilding upon coming to government was to send the two supply vessels mandated offshore and with work on the offshore patrol vessels not due to start until 2018 and with the industry in crisis due to your early first decision, will your Prime Minister revisit this outrageous decision to exclude Australian companies from tendering for the Navy's new supply ships?

                  made clear with its vote yesterday that it agrees with the experts that building our future submarines in Australia would be the cheapest option and ensure that there is enough work to sustain shipyards right across our country. Will you now direct that your sham submarine process only consider proposals for a local Australian build or will the Prime Minister instead keep his secret promise to the

                   In the unlikely event that I was not heard before for all the hysterical shouting from Senator Conroy, let me repeat that during the six years of the Labor government, during which time Senator Conroy, Senator Carr and Senator Wong sat around the cabinet table, not a single Australian naval shipbuilding project was commenced—not one for six years. Notwithstanding that the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Navy were urgently warning the then Labor government of the need to get on with it, to progress naval shipbuilding, they did nothing. You did nothing. We have made the most important announcement in the history of Australian naval shipbuilding with the continuous build and will be announcing the result of the competitive evaluation process of the Future Submarine later this year.
