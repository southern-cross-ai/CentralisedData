         Thank you, Senator Bushby, for your question. I might start with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         . I am very pleased to report that in the last 12 months NBN has continued its run of success. It is fair to say that this government inherited what was a failed project, and that was salvaged by Mr Turnbull. A little more than a year ago, Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrow outlined an ambitious plan based on a three-step scale-up which would see three-quarters of the nation able to access the NBN by 2018. A year on, I can advise that NBN has more than doubled its footprint, its revenue and its connections.
        </p>
        <p>
         Coverage is now expanding at the rate of 30,000 premises each and every week. That is more than 120,000 premises each month. Part of the reason for this success is that, unlike the theological approach of those opposite, we have taken a technology-agnostic approach and used the technology that sees the NBN get to people the fastest and at the lowest cost. So, over the last year, we have released three new products: fibre to the node, the long-term satellite service known as Sky Muster, and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFC" rel="nofollow">
          HFC
         </a>
         —an unadulterated story of good news with the NBN.
        </p>
        <p>
         I should also mention that we are cracking on with our $220 million mobile phone black spot program. Round 1 will see 499 new and upgraded base stations—great news for regional Australia. I should not forget: we have also provided a 25 per cent cut in licence fees for broadcast media and we are endeavouring to abolish the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two-out-of-three rule, with the support of the other side, I hope.

            What we are doing ultimately is always about consumers.

            take the Mobile Black Spot Program's rounds 1, 2 and 3, that is $220 million. That is about making sure that Australians in regional areas get the connectivity that they need. It is important to stay in touch with family and friends. It is important for businesses to stay in touch with their customers. But it is also incredibly important to stay in touch in times of emergency and disaster, particularly when you have bushfires. So we want to do what we can to expand that coverage for Australians in regional areas.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also important to acknowledge the work that we are seeking to do with Australia's media organisations through our media reforms. We want to help those organisations be strong and competitive, because having strong and vibrant Australian media organisations is one of the great underpinnings of diversity in the media.

               As I say, using our technology-agnostic multitechnology mix allows us to give fast broadband to Australians sooner by utilising existing and emerging technologies. Our approach also allows
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                NBN
               </a>
               Co to refresh and augment the network and also to be in a position where it can change and upgrade the network as it needs to instead of being shackled by one technology. That is why we now have nearly two-thirds of the country with the NBN in design or construction or able to order an NBN service.
              </p>
              <p>
               Under the approach of our predecessors, Australians would have been waiting a lot longer for the NBN and paying a lot more for it. Under this government, they will get it sooner and at a lower cost. You only really get the full economic benefit if the whole nation has the NBN. We want the whole nation to have the NBN as soon as possible. Under us, they will.
