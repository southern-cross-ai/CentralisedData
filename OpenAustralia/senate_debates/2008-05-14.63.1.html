        Further to my answer of yesterday, Senator Brown’s question can be best addressed in the broader context of disaster response arrangements already in place in Australia and the region.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As I noted yesterday, Australia has shown a great deal of capability to quickly mobilise civilian and military resources to respond to humanitarian crises. AusAID has responsibility for managing Australia’s overseas aid program, including humanitarian assistance to overseas countries after disasters. This includes coordinating with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Emergency Management Australia
        </a>
        , and, as necessary, other government departments and agencies, to deliver financial, technical and physical assistance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is also a strong participant in a number of regional initiatives, including through the Association of South East Asian Nations and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        Regional Forum. Just two week ago Australia and Indonesia hosted a major
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN_Regional_Forum" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN Regional Forum
        </a>
        disaster relief exercise involving 25 countries with the aim of enhancing regional capacities to cooperate in response to natural disasters. This is in addition to Australian support for, and cooperation with, international disaster relief efforts, including through the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Of course, the tragedy of the current situation in Burma is that the country’s government refuses to allow access by qualified international humanitarian relief experts. As the Prime Minister said in the House yesterday, Australia is continuing to work with its friends and partners in the region to press the Burmese government to improve on their response to the crisis, which has been demonstrably inadequate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I note the press release issued by Senator Brown yesterday that he has also written directly to the Prime Minister on this matter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I understand the Prime Minister has now received this letter and will provide Senator Brown with a considered response in due course.
