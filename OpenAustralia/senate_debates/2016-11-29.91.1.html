         I thank Senator Hume for her question and for her ongoing advocacy for Australians who face extra challenges, for reasons often beyond their control. The Australian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
          International Day
         </a>
         of People with Disability on 3 December is a day to mark the achievements that we have made towards full access and participation by Australians with disability and also an occasion to further champion efforts to that end.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian national cultural institutions play a key role in ensuring all Australians have access to arts and culture. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          National Museum of Australia
         </a>
         , for instance, will hold an event focused on exploring world music for schoolchildren with disability. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Australian_Democracy" rel="nofollow">
          Museum of Australian Democracy
         </a>
         is hosting social media events and a tour through the spaces where the legislation supporting people with a disability was discussed, debated and decided, to highlight the events and people who have paved the way for disability reform in Australia. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          National Gallery of Australia
         </a>
         , for its part, will hold a free digital drawing workshop for people with disability and will provide assisted tours throughout December to the Versailles exhibition. Geelong's own internationally acclaimed Back to Back Theatre and Perth's Sensorium Theatre are at the leading edge of theatre, questioning the assumptions that we have about disability and the making and enjoyment of art.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are just a few examples of the kinds of events being planned to mark this important day in our calendar. I should also note that the National Disability Insurance Scheme will allow many hundreds of thousands of Australians greater opportunity to participate in community life, and that includes artistic and cultural endeavours.

            There are a great range of activities that will be taking place right around Australia, as I foreshadowed. I encourage all my colleagues over the next few weeks to take part in those activities in their own communities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Hume will I think be aware of the fantastic Arts Project Australia organisation based in Northcote in Melbourne, who will be holding their annual gala opening this Saturday afternoon, which showcases the work of over 120 artists. I have visited Arts Project Australia on a number of occasions, and I commend it to colleagues. Alternatively, to head north, this Friday Art Matters will be holding a puppetry performance in Shepparton. There are fantastic events in most communities, and I would encourage all colleagues, where they have the opportunity, to take part.

              Thank you, Minister. Clearly, from the silence of those opposite, there is bipartisan support for these programs. I am interested if the minister can tell the Senate how the Turnbull government is supporting artists with a disability.

                Australia Council
               </a>
               are committed to supporting the good work of my colleague in the other place Mr Porter. I mentioned the important role the National Disability Insurance Scheme will play in enhancing access and participation by Australians with disability.
              </p>
              <p>
               I should point out that the government also supports artists with disability through its involvement in the National Arts and Disability Strategy, which is a framework for collaboration across federal, state and territory governments. In 2015-16, I should mention that the Australia Council invested $375,000 in dedicated funding for artists with disability, and some six per cent of its expert peer grant assessors have a disability themselves. So there is a lot that is happening, there is a lot that is positive and I appreciate Senator Hume giving me the opportunity to expand.
