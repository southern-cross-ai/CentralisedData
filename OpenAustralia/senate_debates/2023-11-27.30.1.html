        As a servant to the many different people who make up our one Queensland community I started this week with my usual check to see if the Prime Minister is in the country today. He is. Hitting 'home' on his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS" rel="nofollow">
         GPS
        </a>
        still brings him back to Australia. What a memory that device has. Prime Minister Albanese clearly doesn't suffer from airsickness, yet he has managed a medical first—spreading airsickness to the rest of the country. We are all thoroughly sick of his air travel. The Prime Minister doesn't get that and with every flight he is crashing the government's poll numbers. It's why the internet has unkindly, though accurately, given the Prime Minister's plane the new name—'Air Albatross'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leaders lead from the front, not from 30,000 feet. Australia needs leadership. Inflation can no longer be blamed on world events beyond our control. All along our inflation has been and is homegrown—demand driven from this government's record new arrivals. There was a time when Australia could have ramped up manufacturing and agriculture to meet demand from the 2.2 million new long-stay arrivals in just the last 12 months, but not anymore. The Hawke-Keating Labor government and the Howard Liberal government sent manufacturing to China. Now we're at the mercy of the Chinese and world markets to source goods, including building materials, to meet the needs of new arrivals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister Plibersek is deliberately nobbling agricultural expansion, with another bill in the Senate today to take away farmers' ability to grow food and fibre for new arrivals. Per capita income has gone backward faster than in any other developed nation in the world, as national wealth is spread across more and more people. A looming federal deficit will force interest rates up and steal even more wealth and opportunity from everyday Australians. Prime Minister, stop dodging responsibility, hang up your Biggles hat, get to work and clean up your mess.
