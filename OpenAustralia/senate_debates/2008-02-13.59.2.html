        implement a range of measures for financing aged care including:

         Reasons for Urgency

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These measures dovetail with reforms to subsidies and supplements contained in the Aged Care Amendment (Residential Care) Act 2007, which take effect on 20 March 2008.  It is critical that the bill be passed early in the 2008 Autumn sittings to enable all delegated legislation to be finalised and to ensure sufficient advance notice of the changes for approved providers and care recipients.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the reforms do not take effect as soon as possible, this will have significant cost implications (noting that the bill will be giving effect to increased government funding of $575.87 million as well as increasing revenue for approved providers from new residents) and will cause significant disruption to care recipients and approved providers (all of whom will be implementing significant systems changes based on the proposed changes to subsidies, fees and charges).

        These are supplementary appropriation Bills which request legislative authority for further expenses to be incurred in 2007-2008 in relation to drought relief and equine influenza assistance.  Passage of the Bills by 14 February 2008 will allow funds to be made available to the

        Additional funding is required to fund further drought relief and equine influenza assistance measures announced since the last Budget.  The additional funding required exceeds what is currently available to DAFF and from the Advance to the

       <p class="italic">
        If timely passage is not granted to the supplementary Bills, all DAFF programs will be delayed for some period until mid-April 2008.
