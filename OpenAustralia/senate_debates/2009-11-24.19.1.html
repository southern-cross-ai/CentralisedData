        Can the minister explain to the Senate why it is that two years after the government’s election, and despite having made extravagant election promises to the Australian people, he has failed to deliver a single new broadband service to a home, business, school or farm under the guise of his much touted

              ABG
             </a>
             . For those in the chamber who are not aware of this, the previous government decided not to fund the ABG at all. In the outyear columns of their budget document was zero, zero, zero, zero. This government took the decision that this is a program that needs to be expanded. Because of the hard work of the Rudd government and the Rann government, we see

             being able to have a footprint across the city of Adelaide for its 500,000 people. As we demonstrated by going not only to the main hub but also to the homes of some of the first people connected, the service in Adelaide is up and running. So the basic premise of the question is false.

                  The entire premise of Senator Minchin’s question is due to the fact that he has spent almost the last three months undermining his leader. What we have seen is the government begin the rollout in Tasmania: trenches are being dug, cables are being strung and ducting is being put up. We are about to announce the Backhaul blackspots program.

                    . Will the minister acknowledge that, as a result of his cancellation of the coalition government’s Optus Elders broadband project, which would have delivered new and affordable services to up to 900,000 underserved premises across rural and regional Australia this year, Australians are without doubt worse off under the Rudd government despite its grandiose election promises?

                     As I mentioned to the chamber before, Senator Minchin is taking a sweep on that side of the chamber to see whether or not he can get himself moved out of this portfolio or get himself replacing the Leader of the Opposition—

                           Let me confirm exactly what Senator Birmingham just said: it was a dog. It was such a dog that it actually failed the precedents in your own contract signed by Senator Coonan, who is sitting behind you. Senator Coonan put in place a series of hurdles that the OPEL project had to meet. Let me be very clear: it failed them because they had no spectrum; they were not prepared to commit the resources.

He was in actual fact terminated by Telstra and, after the intervention of somebody with the president of the company, he was re-employed, did not have to pay back his redundancy package and was paid a minimum starting salary of $400,000. Everyone pointed the finger at Senator Minchin. What did Senator Minchin have to say? A spokesman for Senator Minchin confirmed the minister had known Mr Short for several years but would not say whether he had any role in him being rehired by Telstra. Senator Minchin has known John Short for a long time, but the company’s management policy is entirely a matter for the company. Obviously in his role as finance minister—
