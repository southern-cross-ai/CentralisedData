        Parliamentary Program exchange is an excellent initiative with profound benefits in broadening the horizons of both Defence Force members and parliamentarians. The innovative program fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of each other's roles resulting in a more cohesive and informed government. For ADF members, the program offers a unique opportunity to gain firsthand insights into the intricacies of parliamentary duties and the policymaking processes that can potentially impact upon their operations. By engaging with us as parliamentarians, they develop a comprehensive understanding of the political landscape, enhancing their knowledge of the broader political context.

        This week I had the immense privilege of hosting Corporal Nima Nikfarjam. Nima joins me in the chamber here today, and I'm sure all colleagues join me in welcoming him here. Nima has embraced Australia as his home for the past 16 years, since he moved here from Iran. His deep appreciation for our nation's way of life is truly inspiring. As an electronic technician, Nima and his team in No. 453 Squadron Williamtown Flight provide maintenance support, ensuring safe air traffic control operation for military and civilian flights at

        . In his 10 years of service, Nima has exemplified both Australian and Defence values. Notably, his invaluable role as a translator during the 2021 Afghanistan evacuation showcased his unwavering commitment to our country. Nima's story embodies the spirit of diversity and unity that defines modern Australia.

        This program equips both Defence members and parliamentarians with the knowledge and the perspectives that they need to excel in their respective roles, ultimately benefiting the Australian people. I certainly thank the corporal for joining me this week and I wish him the very best.
