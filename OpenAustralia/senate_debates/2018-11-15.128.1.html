         I thank Senator Hanson-Young for the question. Senator Hanson-Young, I completely reject the proposition of your question. I have to say I think in all of the portfolios in this chamber we back the millions of Australians that you referred to. In relation to the specific issue that you have raised, you would be aware that the bight is one of the most promising frontier oil and gas regions in the world. Australians needs oil and gas from the bight for—as you might be interested to know; the Australian people you referred to would certainly be interested to know—energy security, but also to protect the jobs in manufacturing. And, yes, that is something that we're prepared to do.

         Australia has one of the best and safest offshore regimes in the world. And, in fact, Senator Hanson-Young, your former partners-in-crime, in

             , where offshore petroleum exploration activities have been occurring since the 1960s and they've been occurring safely since then. You may be aware that 13 wells have actually been drilled in the region since 1972, and those were drilled in the region without any incident. Not only is the bight one of the largest underexplored basins in Australia, it is considered by many in the petroleum industry to be one of the most prospective new basins in the world.

               Minister Canavan last week said that we needed to drill for oil in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Australian_Bight" rel="nofollow">
                Great Australian Bight
               </a>
               because petrol prices in Australia were too high, yet he has also said that oil wouldn't be extracted for at least a decade. So why is the minister pretending to the Australian people that putting the bight, our marine life and beaches at risk will lower petrol prices?

               <p>
                Again, Senator Hanson-Young, you will not be surprised that I am going to reject the entire premise of your question. Minister Canavan is incredibly well informed when it comes to these issues. In particular, his concerns, obviously, are for the drilling of oil in the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Australian_Bight" rel="nofollow">
                 Great Australian Bight
                </a>
                . But, as I have stated, 13 wells have been drilled in the region since 1972 without incident.
               </p>
               <p>
                You made some comments previously in relation to Equinor. I am advised Equinor is currently preparing its environment plan for its proposed drilling campaign in the Great Australian Bight. Senator Hanson, you may wish to note that before any drilling can occur, and before you make any other statements that are misleading, Equinor has to submit the plan to Australia's independent regulator, NOPSEMA, for assessment and approval.
