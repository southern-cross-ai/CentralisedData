        and Energy to a question without notice I asked today relating to climate change and loss and damage.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also note that Senator Whish-Wilson will take part of my time. In 1991, Vanuatu, on behalf of small island states, first asked this question: who will pay for climate catastrophe? Over the next three decades, wealthy nations of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North" rel="nofollow">
         Global North
        </a>
        dodged and deflected that question while they continued to fuel the climate crisis. They relentlessly pursued profit and power and put the world on track for climate catastrophe and disasters. These disasters have affected 33 million people in Pakistan; 50 million people in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         Horn of Africa
        </a>
        face the threat of famine; and the climate crisis is an extensional threat to the Pacific nations. After decades of pushing by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_South" rel="nofollow">
         Global South
        </a>
        , a loss and damage fund has finally been agreed to, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , Denmark, Germany and Scotland have all committed to contributing, but Australia still refuses to commit its fair share to loss and damage funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today the climate change minister tabled his first annual climate change statement and mentioned the devastating floods in Pakistan as well as the climate risks faced by Indonesia and the Pacific islands. But it's simply not enough for the government to acknowledge these climate catastrophes and grave climate risks faced by countries of the Global South. It needs to stop pouring fuel on the fire. It beggars belief the climate change minister did not once mention the words 'coal' or 'gas'—not a single time. Honestly, what does the government think is causing the crisis in the first place? Strong and urgent action means no new coal and gas. It is untenable to keep sacrificing the lives and livelihoods of those in poorer nations to maintain the profit margins of fossil fuel conglomerates, many of whom fill political donation buckets for both the big parties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Climate change is a matter of global justice. Those who did nothing to create it are facing the first and worst consequences. Loss and damage funding is about compensation and a debt owed for the terrible legacy of extractivisim and colonialism by the Global North. It is not charity; it is about righting historic wrongs. Given Australia's dirty hands in producing carbon emissions, we have a special responsibility to do everything we can for climate justice. Australia needs to use its diplomatic weight to push for the loss and damage fund to be set up urgently and take the lead by unequivocally committing to loss and damage funding and pay its fair share. That's what real climate leadership on the global stage looks like. That's what listening to our Pacific neighbours looks like. That's what global justice demands of us.

         Not only has the government not answered Senator Faruqi's question on climate change today; they have also not complied with an order of the Senate to provide critical details on their formal response to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN" rel="nofollow">
          IUCN
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">
          UNESCO
         </a>
         reactive monitoring mission report, which they were happy to release earlier this week. They seem to be very big on rhetoric and very light on detail.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minister Plibersek has sat on this report for at least three months. She very craftily put the response out this week, nicely massaged, given to favourite media outlets—we know how it all works. No doubt she also spoke to stakeholders and gave them a sneak preview of it. We hear the response from the government. Of course the report wasn't what they wanted to hear. The IUCN and UNESCO committee recommended that the Great
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
          Barrier Reef
         </a>
         should be put on the 'in danger' list because its outstanding universal values are going to be severely impacted by climate change. It recommended that the government meet its Paris protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
         Why doesn't the government comply with the order of the Senate and provide its official explanation to UNESCO? Did the government say they were going to meet their Paris targets? We know they have legislated a climate target in this place—with no detail or plan for how they will meet it, by the way—that well exceeds our Paris commitments. We know they don't have a plan for that. Where is that detail?
        </p>
        <p>
         What else did they say to UNESCO? Did they say it's unfair that the Barrier Reef has been singled out amongst all the world's coral reefs that are suffering because of warming oceans caused by the burning of fossil fuels? What kind of excuse is that, to say the Barrier Reef shouldn't be singled out? We should be showing leadership and saying that's why the reef should be put on the endangered list, so we can all take action right around the world and understand the gravity of the situation we and future generations are facing.
