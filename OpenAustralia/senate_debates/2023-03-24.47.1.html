        Last week I had the honour of attending the World Indigenous Tourism Summit in Perth, where I spent two days learning about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        tourism around the world, how different countries are embracing unique opportunities for First Nations tourism and how we can protect the cultural heritage of First Nations people as we invest in and expand on our First Nations tourism. It was a very insightful two days and I thank all the presenters for sharing their knowledge.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the key takeaways from my time is just how much work we have in front of us to have a thriving First Nations tourism sector that not only educates the public about our unique culture but which also protects it and ensures that First Nations people are the beneficiaries of sharing this knowledge. Employment for First Nations people in the tourism sector provides an opportunity for mob to stay on country and earn an income by maintaining and sharing their culture and traditions. This helps to continue cultural practices and to foster connection to country and culture, which is vitally important for the wellbeing of First Nations people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to see that First Nations tourism is a feature of the government's THRIVE 2030 plan to invest in our visitor economy. I look forward to working with the government—in particular, with Minister Farrell—to ensure that this plan protects cultural heritage and that there's adequate funding for First Nations tourism in the implementation of this plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I want to urge travellers to ensure that when they go out to the bush or to the coast, or anywhere in this wonderful country we all live and share in, that they know whose land they're on, that they make an effort to learn about that nation's unique culture and stories, that they support First Nations local businesses and that they participate in First Nations cultural tourism activities. They should also do their own research to make sure that these ventures are owned and operated by First Nations people.
