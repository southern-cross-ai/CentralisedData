        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson. Can the minister confirm that his department does not have reliable data about the extent of homelessness amongst veterans and has ongoing links with just one in five recently-returned soldiers?

         As the senator well knows, homelessness in this country is funded by both the state and the Commonwealth government as part of housing agreements. I think the shadow minister is aware of that. The issue of homelessness is an issue for many Australians, not just homeless veterans, but my department works with the VVCS in relation to counselling, in relation to short-term accommodation for homeless veterans.
        </p>
        <p>
         The trouble is, when you try to make a political point by just pulling out one aspect of what is a very significant issue, you do not do yourself any justice. The real issue about veterans' homelessness is that this is the end of the process. What I am determined to do and what the government is determined to do is address those matters that lead to homelessness. That is why we have a full suite of—

          , I rise on a point of order and it is on direct relevance to the question. The question particularly relates to data held by the minister and also the ongoing links with the returned soldiers. I understand the minister has been building up to the answer, but, with 44 seconds to go with his answer, could he draw his attention to it?

            The interjection was that talking about early intervention matters is fluff. According to the opposition, that is fluff. Quite frankly, it is not fluff and this is a very significant issue. We are working to ascertain the level of homelessness of veterans in this country, but, as I said before, we are going to address those core issues which lead to homelessness—that is, mental health—with a whole range and a suite of options available for veterans now which are part of an early intervention program, and many of these veterans are suffering some form of mental health issue. We are going to try and intervene before they get to that stage and we are indeed doing the appropriate work to see how many are homeless.

              Again, the trouble with these things is if you just pick up a newspaper article and start quoting. This 3,000 figure, Senator, is actually something that came out of the United States I think two or three years ago—it might have been four years ago now—and there has been an attempt to extrapolate that into an Australian situation. We think there are probably about 300 veterans who are homeless or at risk of being homeless—homeless or at risk of being homeless—not 3,000.

We are doing what is required. If you want to work with us, you will find me a very willing ally in that task. If you just want to play cheap politics and keep on attacking these initiatives, then you will stand utterly condemned for being totally irrelevant in not only this area of veterans affairs but right throughout the Australian policy setting. You did nothing; you keep on knocking our initiatives. Come and join me in trying to resolve this issue, otherwise excuse yourselves from the policy debate whatsoever. We are trying to address these issues. If you want to be part of it, come and be part of it. If you want to be negative, just remain doing what you are doing.
