        <p class="italic">
         Major Surface Combatants and Amphibious Ships:

        <p class="italic">
         (1) to (3) During the period 1 July to 31 December 2011 the operational availability status of Surface Force naval vessels is summarised in the table below.

         Ships Anzac/Stuart and Arunta, which were de-crewed at different stages of the second half of 2011, the operational manning strengths in the Navy's crewed Surface Force vessels during the period were as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Ninety six per cent crewed with engineering officers and 92 per cent crewed with engineer sailors; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Ninety six per cent crewed with non-engineering officers and 90 per cent crewed with non-engineer sailors.

        <p class="italic">
         Submarines:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) to (3) During the period 1 July to 31 December 2011 the operational availability status of Submarine Force vessels is summarised in the attached table.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The operational manning strengths in the Navy's Submarine Force during the period were:

        <p class="italic">
         (a) One hundred per cent crewed with engineer officers and 95 percent crewed with engineer sailors; and

        <p class="italic">
         (b) Ninety per cent crewed with non-engineer officers and 97 percent crewed with non-engineer sailors.

        <p class="italic">
         Mine Hunting and Clearance Diving Forces:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) to (3) During the period 1 July to 31 December 2011 the operational availability status of Mine Hunting and Clearance Diving Force are summarised in the attached table:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The operational manning strengths in the Navy's Mine Hunting Force vessels (with the exception of Hawkesbury and Norman in Extended Readiness Availability) during the period were:

         consists of both mechanical and electrical technicians; the majority of engineering manning shortfalls came from the Electrical Technician Branch. Mine Sweeper Auxiliary Wallaroo was commensurate with tasking requirements as of July 2011 at 7 days notice for sea, 100 per cent crewed with engineering officers roles (performed by Petty Officer marine technicians borne as senior technical officers) and 100 per cent crewed with engineering sailors.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Due to an extant deficiency in qualified mine warfare and clearance diving officers, the Mine Hunters were manned with 83 per cent of the required skill set. Supplementation of the qualification requirements was achieved through the use of mine warfare officers and Australian Naval reserves. Non-engineering departments were manned with 93 per cent skill set required to achieve necessary tasks.

         Note: Shepparton lost 22 days due to an undiagnosed viral -like illness that infected many of the crew and key command members. Appropriate health measures were taken including not exposing operational reliefs to the illness and therefore the ship was kept alongside until key personnel were fit for sea. The ship remained fully crewed, but remained alongside to ensure full and expeditious recovery of crew from illness.

        <p class="italic">
         (4) The operational manning strengths in the Navy's hydrographic vessels during the period were:

         (a) Hydrographic units were 100 per cent crewed with engineer officers and 100 per cent crewed with Engineer Sailors

         (b) Hydrographic units were 100 per cent crewed with non-engineer officers and 100 per cent crewed with non-engineer sailors.
