        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans, and relates to Afghanistan. Was Australia told or even consulted before the decision was made by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
         NATO
        </a>
        to dramatically change the way the

         US

        -led coalition is fighting the war in Afghanistan—namely, the change with regard to the restriction of joint operations? If so, when were we told, either at an operational level or at a political level? If we were not told, have Australia expressed our disapproval at such unilateral action? Have we now sought clarification as to how the changes will apply in Uruzgan?

         I will provide as much information as I can to the senator in response to her question. I understand the Minister for Defence has made some public comments today on the matter, but at this stage I have not seen those. It is the case that this was an operational decision taken by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
          ISAF
         </a>
         commanders. As I understand it, those commanders continually conduct threat assessments to seek to adapt to the current operating environment. I am advised that recent events outside of and inside Afghanistan related to the

         <i>
          ms
         </i>
         video, plus the conduct of recent insider attacks, has given cause for ISAF troops to exercise increased vigilance and carefully review all activities and interactions with the local population.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commander" rel="nofollow">
          The Commander
         </a>
         of ISAF, General Allen, has directed all operational commanders to review force protection and tactical activities in the light of those circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         As ISAF has said, these are prudent but temporary measures to reduce their profile and vulnerability to civil disturbance or insider attacks. It means that, in some local incidences, operational tempo has been reduced or force protection has been increased. As I said, the tension in the community, they think, has risen and they have taken prudent measures, as they have at other times when they thought there was higher tension in the local community. I am advised that ISAF will remain focused on the continued conduct of effective combined operations with our Afghan partners to achieve the mission. They will always be conducted in a manner that seeks to mitigate the risks.

         As to any other information Minister Smith can provide, I am happy to take that on notice for the senator.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the British did not know, can we have a clarification from the minister as to whether Australia new before this was announced? Secondly, isn't the partnership between the international Afghan forces the core of the mission? If that is the case, doesn't this decision to abandon the core of the mission by keeping Afghan and coalition forces at arms-length mean that there is no longer any rationale for keeping our troops in Afghanistan? Should we not now be bringing our troops home as safely and quickly as possible?

           The answer to that is clearly no. I have explained to the Senate that, as a result of

            ISAF

           —the commanders in the field, the operational leadership—have made a decision about how they will handle the situation and they have sought to review force protection and tactical activities. There is still close cooperation with Afghan forces. The level at which that cooperation takes place has risen, as I understand it, and they are now focusing on the kandak commanders and their staff, while the Afghan company level units within the kandak conduct operations such as patrolling and managing checkpoints and outposts. But I do make the point that this is a temporary operational decision being applied and it does not undermine the essential mission.

The minister has at all times sought to keep the parliament up-to-date with developments in Afghanistan. I am not sure that there is anything in the events of the last few days that would cause us to review our fundamental commitment to Afghanistan or our plans for transitioning to local Afghan command of operations in Afghanistan.
