        The sixteenth report of 2006 addresses the provision of facilities for Project Single Living Environment and Accommodation Precinct (LEAP)—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_One" rel="nofollow">
         Phase One
        </a>
        , at an estimated cost of $406 million. This project is the second Public-Private-Partnership (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPP" rel="nofollow">
         PPP
        </a>
        ) that has come under the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The project proposes to provide 1,295 permanent rooms and the provision of infrastructure and ancillary support services for a period of thirty years across three sites—

         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Amberley, Queensland. The project goes some way to addressing the current shortfall of bed spaces of appropriate standards for single services personnel and includes:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         financing the development of the facilities and services;
        </li>
        <li>
         a commissioned and fully operational living-in-accommodation service, together with all associated furniture and equipment, parking, storage and facilities;
        </li>
        <li>
         all required infrastructure, including upgrading engineering services and other utilities;
        </li>
        <li>
         ongoing operation including repair and maintenance; and
        </li>
        <li>
         supply and conduct of the accommodation services for the facilities including those provided by the strategic partner and those sourced through existing Garrison Support Service and Comprehensive Maintenance Service contracts.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        investigated all aspects of the work paying particular attention to project cost, consultation, project delivery and project implementation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the complexity of the PPP arrangement for this project, the Committee requested an additional confidential briefing to ensure that the details of the expected costs for the project represented value-for-money for the Commonwealth. Another issue for the Committee was that it faced the challenge of considering a project before its final from is known. As a result the Committee recommends that Defence provide it with regular reports on the progress of works as well as a briefing on the final form of the project.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Part of this proposal involves the demolition of existing buildings. The Committee heard that 175 buildings within Gallipoli Barracks contained asbestos and was assured that it would be removed and disposed of during the demolition of the buildings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the Committee recommends that proposed provision of facilities for Project Single LEAP—Phase One proceed at the estimated cost of $406 million.

        The purpose of the proposed works is to provide new and upgraded facilities for handlers and trainers, dog kennelling and training to enable the

       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         46 main kennels;
        </li>

        Subject to Parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in November 2006 and be progressively completed and operational by November 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee conducted a site inspection of the Majura site noting the inadequacy of the facilities for both handlers and canines. The Committee was provided with a comprehensive briefing and demonstration of a canine exercise further highlighting the importance of this capability within the AFP is pleased to recommend that the proposed works proceed at the estimated cost of $10.2 million.

       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         meet the additional accommodation requirements of DEWR which have been significantly affected by the implementation of the Workplace Relations Reforms, and expiration of and existing sub-lease arrangements; and
        </li>
        <li>
         maximise space efficiencies made possible by larger floor plates on offer at 29-31 Brindabella Business Park, taking advantage of the opportunity to collocate currently fragmented working groups
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee considered in detail:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the leasing arrangements of current tenancies and options considered for the project;
        </li>
        <li>
         consultation with staff and other relevant stakeholders;
        </li>
        <li>
         specific design initiatives such as individual workstation configuration and the sound attenuation of the building; and
        </li>
        <li>
         general staff amenity.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee was pleased to note that DEWR had consulted the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greenhouse_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greenhouse Office
        </a>
        and that the Department is currently in negotiations with the building owner to attach a Green Lease Schedule allowing for building owner and tenant to achieve 4.5 star ABGR. The Committee is hopeful that a Green Lease Schedule can be attached to the project, and recommends that the Department keep it informed of its progress with this matter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Having examined all the evidence presented to it, the Committee recommends that the proposed fit-out of new leased premises for the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations proceed at the estimated cost of $15.1 million.
