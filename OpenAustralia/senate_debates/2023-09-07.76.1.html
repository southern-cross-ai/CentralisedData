        ator CASH (—) (): My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Workplace Relations, Senator Watt. In an interview this week with Andrew Clennell on Sky News, when asked whether service contractors were excluded from the labour hire provisions of Labor's

        </a>
        bill, Minister Burke said: 'Completely, completely. Service contractors have been deliberately excluded.' Can the minister guarantee that there are no circumstances under which service contractors could be subject to a regulated labour hire arrangement and that they are, as the minister has stated, completely, completely, deliberately excluded?

         It's always good to get a question about workplace relations from the minister who was in charge of these portfolios when a police raid on union offices was leaked from a minister's office. It's always good to get a question about workplace relations—

             President, personal reflection. I've previously taken exactly this point of order when Senator Watt has raised this matter. It is contrary to what the Federal Court found, and Senator Watt should withdraw, as he has previously.

                Senator Scarr, order! Senator Scarr, I heard your point of order. I advised Senator Watt not to be disorderly. I then invited Minister Gallagher, and there was disorder. That is inappropriate and it's disrespectful. I will seek some advice on your point of order.

                Senator Watt, I was going to call you to order, prior to Senator Scarr jumping to his point of order, to remind you to get to the question. I am not fully aware of the matters Senator Scarr has raised. I invite you to withdraw those comments and get to the point of your response.

                  Cash

                 is that, as Minister Burke has made clear on many occasions, the government accepts that there are legitimate uses for labour hire in the workforce, particularly in areas such as surge, temporary replacement or specialised workforces. But, as I was saying the other day, when Senator Cash asked me a question about this, if an employer has an enterprise agreement and agrees to certain minimum rates of pay then that employer should not be able to use loopholes within our industrial relations laws to undercut the wages they have agreed to. That's what this is about.
