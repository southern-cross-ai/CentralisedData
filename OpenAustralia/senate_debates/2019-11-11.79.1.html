         I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his question.

         also acknowledge the work that Senator O'Sullivan has done prior to coming into this place—in particular, his dedication to getting people off welfare and into work. As Senator O'Sullivan stated, recently the Morrison government held a jobs fair in Mandurah in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . Jobs fairs have been held around Australia, and, to date, we've had in excess of 20,000 Australians come along and talk with local employers about opportunities for work. The Morrison government is committed to getting people off welfare and into work. The jobs fairs are a really practical way of making local connections. Local employers are able to come along to the jobs fair and advertise the local jobs that they have available. It's all about making face-to-face connections. Local people who are looking for work are able to come along, have a look at the jobs board, have a look at what's available and then go and talk to the specific employer who has the job advertised.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is all about the Morrison government's commitment to ensuring that we are getting Australians off welfare and into work and ensuring that Australians understand where the local jobs are available. Since we were elected to government in 2013 the economy has created almost 1.5 million jobs. This is because those of us on the Morrison side of the chamber understand that governments don't create jobs; employers do. We put in place the policy framework. Under our policies employers are able to prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians. Under this government we've achieved record participation rates, record full-time employment and record women participating in the workforce.

            The best form of welfare is a job. This is something that we as a government fundamentally believe. It is also work that is integral to supporting a strong economy. When a person is able to get a job—when they move from welfare and into work—they are no longer in receipt of social services and they become taxpaying citizens. That is a good thing. But there are also the incalculable other benefits that having a job provides. When you go and talk to people who've been on unemployment benefits and made that transition into the workforce, they describe to you the self-esteem they get because they now have a job and the ability to provide for their family and because, more than that, now that they have a job, they are able to be a role model for others around them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under this government welfare dependency is the lowest it has been in 30 years.

                     Because we want Australians to keep more of what they earn, more of their hard-earnt money. We on the coalition side of the chamber are also committed to reducing the costs of doing business. This, of course, includes deregulation but also ensuring that small and medium enterprises are paid on time and ensuring that we give Australians the skills that they need and that businesses are telling us that they need.

                       And of course there is the great work done by successive trade ministers to expand our trade borders to access more markets, because, when a small or medium business is able to access another market, they are able to grow their business and create more jobs for Australians.
