        My question is to Senator Fierravanti-Wells, representing the Minister for Health. During question time last year, I asked what government was doing to assist consumers make informed choices about their health treatment. In particular, I reference the lack of publicly available
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IVF" rel="nofollow">
         IVF
        </a>
        clinic performance data, which in effect rewards poorest-performing clinics. In 2014, live birth rates between clinics varied from between nine per cent and 24 per cent from fresh cycles. In 2012, it was as low as four per cent and up to 31 per cent. However, consumers aren't able to determine individual clinic results. Former Senator Nash, representing the minister, said government had been working with a range of stakeholders on 'the development of a transparency model'. Can the minister advise what work has been done on this transparency model, specifically related to assisted reproductive technology? And when will it be released to the public?

         I thank Senator Griff for the question and for advance notice of it. Minister Hunt is supportive of work to increase the transparency of outcomes for patients. On 2 January this year, he announced the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Out-of-Pocket Costs, chaired by the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy. The committee is investigating out-of-pocket costs and options to ensure that consumers are better informed of fees before agreeing to treatment. The committee has held two meetings: on 8 February and 23 March this year. The committee is due to provide a report to the minister at the end of 2018. Communiques are released shortly after each meeting.

         Currently, individual fertility clinics capture data on the outcomes of assisted reproductive technology treatment procedures. This data is collected and analysed by the Australia and New Zealand Assisted Reproduction Database, which is funded by the Fertility Society of Australia. Neither the public nor the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health
         </a>
         has direct access to this database. The

         Directors Group has offered to work with the department, once they are satisfied with agreed data parameters, to introduce an improved database to collect assisted reproductive technology data that would be reconcilable with

           told me it was in ongoing discussions with industry about publishing assisted reproductive technology success rates on a clinic-by-clinic basis. However, during the recent February estimates, I was told that the department has no intention of publishing clinic success rates. Which of these is correct?

               This is a complex and difficult area with varying medical views regarding the merits of publishing success rates. Part of the role of the

               is to monitor the policy settings and delivery of other health systems internationally. This includes being alert to models and initiatives such as consumer-focused websites offering outcome-based information regarding healthcare services. The publishing of clinical performance data is a matter for industry.
