        My question is to Senator Faulkner, the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister update the Senate on developments in Zimbabwe? What action are Australia and the international community taking in response to recent reports of the extremely serious and deteriorating situation in that country?

         I thank Senator Forshaw for his questions, and I am sure his concerns are echoed by all senators in the chamber. I can assure the Senate that the Australian government is gravely concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe. Over the weekend
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe" rel="nofollow">
          Robert Mugabe
         </a>
         said that the opposition Movement for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Democratic Change
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDC" rel="nofollow">
          MDC
         </a>
         , would never rule Zimbabwe and that he was prepared to go to war to prevent them doing so. I think this is a stark reminder of Mugabe’s blatant disregard for the democratic rights of the Zimbabwean people and his unwillingness to accept their will at the forthcoming presidential run-off election on 27 June.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government strongly condemns the intensifying and disturbing pattern of intimidation and terrorising of opposition leaders, civil society and ordinary Zimbabweans. The leader of the MDC,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Tsvangirai" rel="nofollow">
          Morgan Tsvangirai
         </a>
         , has been arrested no fewer than five times in the last week while campaigning, MDC Secretary-General Tendai Biti remains in detention on spurious grounds, and there is extensive state sponsored violence against the general population. Clearly, there are grave implications for the people of Zimbabwe and for the prospect of credible elections. Furthermore, I think the Zimbabwe government’s suspension of humanitarian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
          NGO
         </a>
         activity in Zimbabwe is immoral and represents a callous move by the Mugabe regime to use food security as a political weapon against its own people. Hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans risk hunger in the short term as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Smith
         </a>
         , have urged the international community, especially Zimbabwe’s neighbours in southern Africa, to take a stand and put pressure on Mugabe to accept the will of the people. We welcome reports that over 120 election observers from African countries have already arrived in Zimbabwe, with indications that around 400 more are to come. We also welcome the joint statement of 13 June by eminent Africans, including many former heads of state and also former heads of government, calling for elections to be conducted in a peaceful, free and fair manner.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has been one of a number of countries at the forefront of efforts to put pressure on the regime through sanctions and diplomatic pressure. Since 2002 Australia has implemented targeted sanctions against the Zimbabwean government. The sanctions cover restrictions on visas for travel to Australia by Zimbabwean ministers and certain Zimbabwean officials, freezes on financial assets, suspension of non-humanitarian aid, prohibition of defence links, suspension of bilateral ministerial contact and downgrading of cultural links. The government continues to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe. I would say, as both the Prime Minister and the foreign minister have made clear, that Australia, with others in the international community, stands ready to participate in reconstruction in partnership with a Zimbabwean government that properly and fairly represents the democratic will of the Zimbabwean people and is committed to political and economic reform.

           Yes, it is a critical issue. I note that, in a letter dated 4 June sent to aid groups in Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwean Minister for Public Service, Labor and
