        I thank Senator Patrick for his courtesy in allowing me to go before him. Tonight, I rise to pay tribute to a wonderful woman—my dear late friend Teresa Todaro-Restifa. In 2016, Teresa was diagnosed with a tumour. Her determination to outlast the prognoses of her various doctors meant she fought not just the cancer, but the treatment it required. Despite this determination, her struggle was a difficult one which she recently lost. I am so pleased that her husband, Sam, and her daughter, Isabella, and grandson, Alessandro, are in the gallery this evening.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teresa was born on 24 March 1952 in Poggioreale, a small town in Sicily. She grew up there surrounded by a large and loving family. At age 16, whilst studying architecture and art at the Institut Palermo, her life was turned upside down when the valley of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belice_River" rel="nofollow">
         Belice River
        </a>
        suffered a devastating earthquake which destroyed her home town as well as all that she cherished and loved. Soon after that, she moved to Sydney with her parents, sisters and brother. She was forced to give up her studies in order to earn money for the family and instead obtained a diploma in accounting from Metropolitan Accountancy College in Sydney. In giving the eulogy at her funeral, her son, Simon, said that one of Teresa's greatest regrets was not completing her studies, which in turn meant that she worked so hard to ensure her own children received the best education possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1970, she commenced work at
        <i>
         La Fiamma
        </i>
        , the Italian newspaper. However, it was her desire to help people that led her to volunteer with Co.As.It—the Italian assistance organisation in 1971, helping newly arrived Italian migrants to integrate into the Australian community. This was the beginning of a life-long contribution to the Italo-Australian community which made her one of the most well-known and respected community figures.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was during her time working in the arrival centre that she met a fellow volunteer, Sam Restifa, who was to be her lifelong companion. A strong bond and friendship developed between Teresa and Sam and together they set about to helping young Italian migrants by organising social events for them. Teresa and Sam married in 1974 and quickly set about building their future family. Sam, you gave Teresa everything, but above all, she had your love and you had her love. It was the strength of this bond that ensured yours was a successful marriage for life. And so, after working at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC" rel="nofollow">
         CBC
        </a>
        Banking Corporation for a short time, she and Sam welcomed their son, Simon, in 1979, and three years later Isabella was born.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1980, Teresa became a director of Restifa and Partners, the business which she and Sam built up to be a successful private consultancy firm specialising in the administration and construction of commercial centres all over Australia. A devoted wife and mother, Teresa sacrificed a lot of her own dreams in order to fulfil the role of family matriarch.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teresa and I first started activities together in the 1990s, when we were founding members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_Italiana" rel="nofollow">
         Accademia Italiana
        </a>
        della Cucina, a Sydney delegation of which she became treasurer in 2000. Our role was to judge Italian restaurants. Our members were all fine cooks and arbiters of good Italian cuisine. Of course we took our jobs seriously and enjoyed many fine evenings at some good Italian restaurants and some not-so-good ones. It was great fun, and Teresa's organisational skills meant our gatherings always ran with precision.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teresa was a marvellous cook and it was always a pleasure to dine at the Restifas'. Of course, her speciality was Sicilian cooking, and I recall a particularly stunning cassata which she made according to an old traditional family recipe. Over the years, we met at the Restifas' home for meetings. Teresa and Sam were always generous hosts, and we were very grateful for them opening their wonderful home for what were always convivial gatherings.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2000 Teresa became a board member of the San Antonio Da Padova di Poggioreale Nursing Home in Ryde, a position she held for 17 years. Over her many years of community activities, she was involved with many different groups, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Dante Alighieri Society
        </a>
        , movement of Christian workers in Australia, various associations of Sicilian groups and the Patronato
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIAS" rel="nofollow">
         SIAS
        </a>
        in Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2004 Teresa was elected to Com.It.Es, the Committee of Italians Abroad, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , and this of course set the scene for her to have a tilt at the Italian parliament. Italian residents residing abroad are entitled to elect 12 members to the house of deputies and six senators. There are a number of constituencies around the world. We live in the constituency of Africa, Asia, Oceania and Antarctica, and in 2006 Teresa stood for that constituency. Whilst the bulk of the voters were situated in Australia, many resided in Africa and, to a lesser extent, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_and_the_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
         Asia and the Pacific
        </a>
        . Of course, this really does constitute electioneering on a grand scale. It required Teresa not only to travel to different parts of the world but to commit considerable resources towards her election.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        acknowledge the wonderful support that Sam, Isabella and Teresa's whole family gave to her to help her in this quest. Whilst unsuccessful, Teresa continued with her community activities. She stood again in 2008 and again in 2013 in the same constituency. Whilst Teresa herself was not elected to the chamber of deputies, her son-in-law, Mario Borghese, from the Movimento Associativo Italiani all'Estero, was elected to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" rel="nofollow">
         South America
        </a>
        n constituency in 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can I especially acknowledge the challenges that you, Isabella, have faced. You and Mario live in Cordoba, in Argentina, and you have not only supported your husband Mario in his work in the Italian parliament in Rome and in South America but also come backwards and forwards to Australia to be with mum.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2013, notwithstanding not being successful at the Italian elections, Teresa was re-elected to community service with Com.It.Es New South Wales. She worked very hard. Her warm, friendly nature meant that she received a lot of support, but, regrettably, due to the formidable machinery of the Left and its associated entities in Australia, she was unsuccessful. As a conservative female myself, I understood well the challenges that Teresa faced. Having myself been involved in many Italo-Australian community activities and having also been elected to various of its representative positions, I knew firsthand the difficulties and the personalities involved. We gave each other friendship, understanding and support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am really, truly sorry that Teresa never achieved her ambition to be elected to the Italian parliament. I have no doubt that, had she done so, she would have been a very fine and very committed member of parliament. She would have served with distinction and made sure that she dutifully responded to the needs of all her constituents across this vast electorate. Teresa was also a member of the Liberal Party, having joined in 2007. She served in various capacities, including as Vice-President and then President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Italian Special Branch of the party.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to publicly acknowledge the wonderful support that Teresa and her family have given me throughout my career. Teresa was one of only a very few number of women on the conservative side of politics in the Italo-Australian community, and we were proud to support each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teresa also received various recognitions for her community work. In 2005 she became a dame and then, in 2007, a baroness within the Italian Order of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Crown" rel="nofollow">
         Iron Crown
        </a>
        . In 2010 she became an ambassador of the Order. In 2007 she was made a Dame of Grace of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John" rel="nofollow">
         St John
        </a>
        of Jerusalem. I must say she looked very distinguished in her official robes!
       </p>
       <p>
        An example of Teresa's can-do attitude was when the Pope visited for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Youth_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Youth Day
        </a>
        . Teresa was told that 2,000 young Italians were arriving and needed somewhere to stay. Teresa mobilised, and within 48 hours she had the Marconi Club organised so that they could sleep, had somewhere to stay and were looked after during their stay. This was so typical of Teresa. She was always willing to lend a hand. She was warm, generous and had a wonderful sense of humour. I know she helped many people, and I am sure that many will remember her with fondness and gratitude. The last time I saw Teresa, she castigated me for working too hard. Given her own work ethic, I took the reprimand with a wry smile.
       </p>
       <p>
        To you, Sam, Isabella, Mario, Simon and all your family: it has been hard to see her wonderful, strong spirit wilting under the gravity of the illness that took her. We will miss her smile and we will always remember the wonderful woman she was. Vale Teresa Todaro Restifa.
