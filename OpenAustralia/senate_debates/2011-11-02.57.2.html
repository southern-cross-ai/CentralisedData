        and Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sherry. How will the government use the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax to deliver the benefits of the mining boom to Australia's small businesses, and what role will the minerals resource rent tax play in delivering a simpler and fairer tax system and higher superannuation for fund members and in spreading the benefits of the resources boom to all Australians?

        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Cameron. The minerals resource rent tax was introduced in the House of Representatives yesterday. It will raise some $11 billion-plus. This Labor government is very proud of this new tax. We are very proud of it because that $11 billion will be spent on cutting tax elsewhere in the Australian economy. At a time of a 260 per cent increase in mining profits—including, we saw from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
          BHP
         </a>
         , some $23 billion—we intend to use that $11 billion to cut taxes in the rest of the community. Let me give a couple of illustrations.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will be cutting tax on small business by over a billion dollars a year with money from the minerals resource rent tax. We will be introducing a much improved instant asset write-off rule, with the current $1,000 maximum going to $6,500.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
          The Liberal Party
         </a>
         will not support this tax cut for small business.
        </p>
        <p>
         We intend to cut tax on the superannuation of 3½ million Australians—the contributions tax. Low- and middle-income earners, 3½ million of them, will have their contributions tax cut. The Liberal Party will not support the cutting of the contributions tax to 3½ million low- and middle-income earners.
        </p>
        <p>
         We intend to increase the superannuation guarantee. Again, we are very proud of the superannuation guarantee. We introduced compulsory superannuation in this country, opposed by the Liberal-National Party. They warned that compulsory superannuation would destroy the economy, like the mining tax.

          , I ask a supplementary question. In what practical ways will the government's tax reform package funded by the minerals resource rent tax help Australians with their tax affairs, reward savings and increase the flow of credit?

           Thank you. In addition to tax cuts for small business and tax cuts for 3½ million superannuation contributors, we will be making tax time a lot easier for 6½ million Australians. We will be introducing a standard tax deduction: $500 in the first year and a thousand dollars in the second year. Six and a half million Australians will be receiving a standard tax deduction of up to a thousand dollars.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
            The Liberal Party
           </a>
           do not support this important reform either. They oppose a thousand-dollar tax deduction for 6½ million individuals in our tax system. They oppose this important reform.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition to this we intend to deliver tax relief on up to a thousand dollars in savings for individual Australians. Tax cuts to small business, tax cuts to superannuation contributions, standard tax deductions and, of course, for a couple of million Australians interest-free savings.
