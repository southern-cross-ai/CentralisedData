           The Morrison government is committed to preventing, addressing and ultimately ending family, domestic and sexual violence in Australia. Violence against women and children is an issue that this government is responding to, with the largest-ever Commonwealth investment of $340 million to support the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. Delivery of frontline domestic and family violence services is, however, a matter for the state and territory governments.

              will be opposing this motion. We oppose all forms of domestic violence, male- and female-generated, because we care for and respect both women and men and especially children and families. So, we cannot support this one-side, biased motion.
