        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to senior Liberal senator, Senator Bernardi, who says he hopes the foreign minister, Ms Bishop, gets the opportunity to hold the top job. Does the minister share that view?

        <p>
         Casting a very casual eye over to Senator Bernardi, I would hardly describe him as senior, whereas the gentleman sitting next to him I might describe as senior. Nevertheless, Senator Bernardi is, I think, quite right to acknowledge that there is an embarrassment of riches on this side of the chamber, both in this House and the other. For him to acknowledge and say that potentially one day Ms Bishop might lead the party, I see no difficulty with that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do not know if Senator Carr has a difficulty with that because it is a woman who Senator Bernardi is supporting. We do not know whether that is the reason, but what I can say is that this is 2015—the year that Mr Shorten promised would be the year of ideas. Of course, I thought the piercing intellect of Mr Shorten had reached its height when he said, 'I don't know what the Prime Minister said but I support it.' Now he has reached another height. He has achieved an even greater saying, and it is this: 'I don't know what the Treasurer is going to say tonight, but I know I am against it.' That is the attitude of the

          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         . On the eve of the federal budget, all that Senator Carr can do is trawl through and talk about the gossip rather than the real issues confronting the Australian nation—getting the budget back into shape and creating jobs for our fellow Australians. That is the task that Senator Bernardi and I are dedicated to. I can inform the honourable senator that Ms Bishop is dedicated to that task as well.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the former Liberal member for Indi, Ms Sophie Mirabella, who says that the social services minister, Mr Morrison, will be 'the next conservative Prime Minister of Australia'. Does the minister share that view?

           Yet again the honourable senator has confirmed the embarrassment of riches on our side of the chamber—that there are all these potential leaders. The good news is that we are well and truly satisfied with the leadership of the Prime Minister and he will do a fantastic job right through to the next election, and after, because we have confidence in his leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to Ms Mirabella, can I say that her involvement in public life is something that I welcome, and I hope that she runs for the parliament again and is re-elected. What I can say to the people of Indi is that, in relation to Bruck Textiles of Wangaratta, I get more representations from Ms Mirabella looking after the interests of the workers there than the current member for Indi, and I think the people of Indi made a great mistake at the last election and I look forward to Ms Mirabella's return.
