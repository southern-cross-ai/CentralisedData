       <p class="italic">
        On 30 July 2020, the committee released its final report. The committee noted the need for the dairy cattle export charge, as the previous voluntary levy scheme faced problems with under-collection, leaving the dairy cattle export industry without sufficient funds for research and development and marketing activities. The committee noted the wide consultation undertaken by the Australian Livestock Exporters' Council (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALEC" rel="nofollow">
         ALEC
        </a>
        ) on the imposition of the charge and the industry support for the charge.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee noted that ALEC needs to ensure that the major dairy farming industry bodies, including the Victorian body, have an ongoing say in how the levy funds are spent. The department notes that primary industries drive all aspects of their levy. As such, a request for a levy (or a proposal for levy changes), must be supported by industry bodies representing, wherever possible, all existing and/or potential levy payers, the relevant levy beneficiaries and other interested parties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The department acknowledges the levy review timeframe of seven years proposed by ALEC in its levy submission
        <i>
         (2)
        </i>
        , and the committee's comment that the department consider the merits of this proposal. As agricultural levies and their review are industry driven, the department will work with ALEC at the time industry considers a review of the dairy cattle export charge is warranted. The publication
        <i>
         Levy Guidelines: how to establish or amend agricultural levies
        </i>
        (3), provides guidance to industries on how to review a levy and key points to consider when thinking about a levy review. The department has drawn this publication to ALEC's attention.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        have significant and ongoing concerns about the cruelty inherent to the live export trade, including the well-documented impacts of heat stress on sheep and cattle during voyages from Australia, and experiences in destination countries. Australians have been shocked by revelations of thousands of animals dying from heat stress and overcrowding on ships and overwhelmingly want this cruelty to end. Animals continue to die on live export ships. The live export industry should be shut down.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.2 For any charge on the export of dairy cattle, all funds raised, including co-contributions from the government should be allocated directly to animal health and welfare initiatives, and not for marketing and profitability. All animal health and welfare initiatives, including research, should be undertaken transparently, with regular public reporting and appropriate oversight.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.3 Recommendation: That all funds raised by the dairy cattle export charge, including co contributions from the government, be allocated directly to animal health and welfare initiatives, to be undertaken transparently, with regular public reporting and appropriate oversight.

        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government notes the preference of the Greens for the entirety of the export charge to be directed to animal health and welfare initiatives. The export charge is a request by industry, supported by industry, to fund the program of works under the Dairy Cattle Export program for its benefit. At industry's request, the Dairy Cattle Export Program focusses on a number of key priorities including animal health and welfare, supply chain efficiency, regulatory performance, and market access for the dairy cattle export sector.
