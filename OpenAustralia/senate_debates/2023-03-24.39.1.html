        I'd like to share with the Senate the incredible career and work of one of our educators, a dear friend in the remote East Arnhem region, Yalmay Yunupingu. Having spent more than 40 years working as an educator, inspiring and supporting children in the bush, Yalmay began her education career in 1974 as a librarian at the Yirrkala School and took up various jobs, including as classroom and senior teacher, teacher linguist, and also acting principal. As well as teaching students, she oversaw pivotal projects, including: the Galtha Rom workshop, which involves learning on country; the Garma maths curriculum, which embeds Indigenous learning into mathematics; the Yaku ga Rirrakay language app; and the first Aboriginal language and culture component of the

        curriculum framework, creating pathways for more-informed Aboriginal education.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Yunipingu is a strong advocate for bilingual learning, where children are taught their own language, Yolngu Matha, alongside English. She's described by her colleagues as a bilingual warrior and also a gentle and loving teacher. Ms Yunipingu has a love for books and described how she would translate
