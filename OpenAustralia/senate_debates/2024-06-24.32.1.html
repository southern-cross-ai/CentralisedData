        I'd like to bring to the attention of the Senate the passing of Reverend Dr Gondarra, a prominent Yolgnu elder and leader. He was an incredible man, a very strong leader who fought for justice, truth-telling and treaty. He advocated for his people and had immense pride in Yolgnu language, law and culture. While Chairman of the

        Progress Association for over 30 years, he created economic opportunities for his community through stores, employment and community services. His legacy is significant and will reverberate across Arnhem Land, the

        and, indeed, Australia. I share in the grief being experienced by his community, and I offer my sincere condolences to his family. I thank his family for welcoming me, in their time of grief, to join with them as we respected and celebrated the memory of this amazing man.

        I had visited Galiwin'ku to attend the Yota Dokitji event. This was a special opportunity to learn more about the project: its achievements, current challenges and future aspirations.

        women and their babies experience poorer health outcomes compared to non-Indigenous mothers and their babies. The rate of preterm birth experienced by First Nations mothers is almost double that of non-Indigenous mothersâ€”14.1 per cent in First Nations mothers compared with 7.9 per cent. We know the importance of community led and culturally safe maternity care. The djakamirr model of care is an exceptional example of birthing on country.
