           The Rudd Labor government are absolutely committed to strong border protection policies. The fact is that we have invested more in border protection than any other government. What we are dealing with at the moment is a situation where we are seeing record flows of persons out of Afghanistan, which is causing pressure in the form of unlawful movement and irregular flows throughout the world. Australia is getting its share of those people fleeing Afghanistan.
          </p>
          <p>
           I remind Senator Humphries that last year we had the fourth largest number of arrivals in a calendar year. The previous three record years were under the Howard government, and they were 1999, 2000 and 2001. The reason the numbers arriving decreased after that was that the Taliban fell in Afghanistan and people were no longer found to be refugees and were returned to Afghanistan if they sought asylum. The same occurred in Iraq, following the fall of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" rel="nofollow">
            Saddam Hussein
           </a>
           . What we are dealing with at the moment is an international problem of an increased number of asylum seekers, more than 90 per cent of whom still go to Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have strong border protection in place. We have mandatory detention. We have offshore processing. Working with our neighbours, we are determined to combat this problem of unlawful arrivals. At the moment we are dealing with increased activity. We are seeking to work with our neighbours to try and stop the flow, to try and provide durable solutions for people, both in their home country and in countries of transit. We will continue to provide resources for border protection and resources to try and address this global problem of unlawful and irregular movement.

            have a current capacity of 1,848 people, and given that the latest arrival of 181 and four crew will increase the detention population to more than 1,830—that is, within 20 beds of being completely full—will the government guarantee that no asylum seekers will be transferred to the mainland from Christmas Island before their claims have been determined?

             What I can do first of all is correct Senator Humphries. Your figures are not exactly right. Effectively there are about 1,800 beds. In fact, it is slightly less.

               Senator Humphries got the figures wrong, but I am saying that they are in small numbers. We have remaining capacity at
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
                Christmas Island
               </a>
               and the capacity is being expanded. More capacity has come online recently and more will come on in the next few weeks. But we have also made it very clear that if we need capacity we will use the other detention centre built by the Howard government, the immigration detention facility in Darwin, to finalise processing. I have made that clear.

               It is interesting that today the Liberal opposition announced that you were returning to the Pacific solution, that you were going to again look for third countries to process people in. Nauru is back on the agenda. That is a very interesting development—

                 I can advise that we are dealing with an increased number of persons in detention. That is correct. They are nowhere near the numbers that the Howard government had to deal with in a series of camps around Australia, but we are dealing with increased numbers. What we have done is increase the capacity on
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
                  Christmas Island
                 </a>
                 . We have used the very modern facility, built by the Howard government, which only came online in 2007 as part of the Howard government’s preparedness for the next spike in activity. We thank them for that, because we are sure they would not have built it otherwise. Otherwise you are suggesting that they wasted $400 million to build an 800-bed facility that they were never going to use.
