        In the debate on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill, Liberal and Nationals senators repeatedly referred to the needs of business to justify their low-wage agenda. If they're really on the side of business, they'll support the second closing loopholes bill when we return next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The road transport reforms are supported by every major road transport employer association in this country. I don't have the time to list them all, but I do want to call out the National Road Freighters Association, who supported the abolition of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal but support these reforms.

        , an owner-driver and a board member of the NRFA, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our industry is in a desperate race to the bottom. … This legislation will play a vital role in establishing minimum standards for all and allowing the industry to become safe, viable and sustainable.
       </p>
       <p>
        There it is in black and white. Owner-drivers, road transport employers, transport workers and unions are all on the same page, calling for life-saving reform.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's the same in the gig economy, where Uber, Menulog and DoorDash have joined the

        </a>
        and gig workers in calling for life-saving reform. Utsav, a gig worker here in Canberra told us:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I work 40 to 60 hours every week, and sometimes even 80 hours, to make the basic survival payments to pay my bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I haven't slept more than four hours in two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        That isn't safe. At least 14 gig workers are dead. At least 209 people have been killed in truck crashes in this year alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyone says there is a need for reform, except the greedy racketeers at the Minerals Council, who make a buck by squeezing the transport industry literally to death. In the new year, we'll see which businesses those opposite really represent.
