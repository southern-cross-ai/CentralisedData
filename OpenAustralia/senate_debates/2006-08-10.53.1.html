        My question is to Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister representing the Minister for Defence—and, I guess, vicariously through him, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator Sandy Macdonald. The minister would be aware that the Prime Minister visited Townsville a week ago last Monday to make a very significant announcement in relation to Jezzine Barracks in Townsville. Will the minister elaborate on the federal government’s commitment to the preservation of the Jezzine Barracks site? Further, is the minister aware of the positive response by the coalition in Queensland to the Prime Minister’s generous offer within three hours? Is the minister aware of whether the Queensland state government has responded to the Prime Minister’s very generous offer of additional money for Jezzine Barracks?

         I thank Senator Ian Macdonald for a question that concerns his home base of Townsville; his Senate electorate office has been located there for 16 years. He takes a very close interest, along with his colleague

         Senator Macdonald is right: on 1 August the Prime Minister announced that 87 per cent of the Jezzine Barracks site will be handed back to the community. It will be a phenomenal asset for Townsville. It will complement significant works done around that foreshore to make it a very friendly place for not only Townsville residents but also the growing number of visitors who come to Townsville to enjoy one of

         ’s true jewels in terms of the natural wonders of that magnificent part of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister announced that 87 per cent would be vested as a gift to the Townsville council.

         will retain Jezzine House as a residence for the senior military commander in Townsville—obviously a post that people would fight for, because it is a fairly pleasant place to reside. Also, the 31st

         precinct will become the home for a relocated Army history museum. That will become a tremendous tourist precinct for Townsville.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister also announced a $10 million grant to a new community trust which will help to invest in the upgrade of this magnificent site. He made that $10 million grant on the condition that the money is matched by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Townsville City Council
         </a>
         . We have also offered a further $10 million subject to matching funds from the Queensland government. So, effectively, the Commonwealth’s money can be leveraged to as high as $40 million on top of the already very valuable land that we have handed over. This creates a fantastic opportunity for North Queensland and a fantastic opportunity for Townsville—potentially $40 million of investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said, it does rely on the Townsville City Council matching that $10 million and the Queensland government matching the further $10 million. Until I came to the chamber for question time, we had not heard any news at all about the Queensland government’s contribution. We had in fact heard within three hours of the Prime Minister’s announcement that the coalition have promised that they would match the Commonwealth’s funds. I am glad that Senator Macdonald asked that. We have yet to hear any news about the Townsville City Council. I join Senator Macdonald in urging those two governments, the state and local governments, to match these funds. It is a fantastic opportunity for Townsville, which is developing so well. The amount of money potentially available, if the Queensland government match the $10 million and the Townsville City Council match the other $10 million, will be $40 million. I congratulate Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator Sandy Macdonald on their hard work, as well as the work done by Peter Lindsay, the local member.
