        My question is to the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, Senator Sherry. Can the minister update the Senate on responses to the government’ $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, including any alternative views?

         As is well known, the Labor government, acting decisively, has announced a $42 billion nation building and jobs package in response to the global financial and economic crisis. We know that the Liberal opposition have announced they will oppose this, largely on the grounds of budget deficit and accrued government debt. However, what we have had from the opposition in the last day is a major superannuation announcement. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull—this was confirmed last night—and the shadow minister, Mr Pearce, have announced a new approach to superannuation. They are arguing that the government should in fact pay the superannuation guarantee obligations of a substantial proportion of businesses in Australia. This is their new proposal. I have here a copy of the press release on the opposition’s new proposal to pay superannuation entitlements from the budget for a substantial proportion of Australian businesses. At the end of this press release, however, there is no cost as to this proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course I thought that Treasury should be asked to cost this. It is truly staggering, given we have an opposition that is complaining about budget debt and government debt, what the Liberal opposition proposal on superannuation would cost the nation were it to be adopted. In the initial two years of the superannuation proposal of the Liberal opposition it would cost some $20.5 billion—and this was the announcement made last night. Over three years—

           alternative superannuation plan would cost over three years $31.5 billion. Over four years, which is about the same time as the Labor Party’s $42 billion package, the Liberal superannuation policy would cost $43 billion, a larger cost—in a superannuation policy from the Liberal opposition—than the Labor Party’s $42 billion plan. And this is from an opposition which argues we should not have such large budget and government deficits!

             If we add that $43 billion costing for the new superannuation plan announced by the leader of the Liberal opposition and the shadow minister, Mr Pearce, to the already announced proposals of the Liberal opposition, which have come to $15 billion, that means the grand total of the Liberal Party announcements to date to stimulate the economy come to some $58 billion.
