       <p>
        Yesterday Senator Siewert asked a question of Senator Abetz, who was representing me in my role as Minister for the Environment and Heritage. It was in relation to the entanglement of whales and interactions with the western rock lobster industry. I have some detailed information, which I seek leave to incorporate in
        <i>

        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The answer read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Siewert yesterday asked about migrating whale populations in WA and interaction with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Rock_Lobster" rel="nofollow">
         Western Rock Lobster
        </a>
        Industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is very concerned about humpback whales and leatherback turtles being entangled in any fishing gear or marine debris.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Improved fishing practices are the key to reducing whale and turtle entanglements in all fisheries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Western Rock Lobster Council in conjunction with the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management has developed a code of practice for reducing whale entanglements, this includes ensuring that lobster pot lines are properly tied off to remove slack thus greatly reducing the chances of whales being caught in the ropes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of the Government’s ongoing effort to reduce entanglements, my Department is working with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian Government
        </a>
        and the Western Rock Lobster fishery to seek further improvements in fishing practices and reinforce adherence to the code of practice by the fishery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am aware that there have been four reported cases of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_Whales" rel="nofollow">
         Humpback Whales
        </a>
        being entangled in gear from the Western Rock Lobster fishery since the start of this year’s migration season in May 2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am pleased to report that all of these whales were successfully freed from the entanglement by State government officials specially trained in disentanglement techniques.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There was a fifth whale entanglement reported by a fisher but not necessarily entangled in gear from that fishery–the whale was apparently entangled in unknown marine debris –however WA officials were unable to locate the animal so that report is unconfirmed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports a range of initiatives to respond to entanglements including training operational personnel tasked with disentangling whales and the development of satellite tags to help track and re-locate entangled whales.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is no definitive information on the number of leatherback turtles entangled in this fishery. While the exact number of leatherback turtles entangled is not known, it is estimated that 75% of these animals are released alive.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The success rate of disentangling humpback whales in the Western Rock Lobster Fishery has increased from approximately 50% in the 90’s to 100% this year. This increase is a result of promoting best practice for disentangling whales through national large whale disentanglement workshops and the good working relationship between the fishery and the Western Australian Government.
