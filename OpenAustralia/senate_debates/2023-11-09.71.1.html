        World, the Dubai state owned port operator, has announced it will dramatically increase the fees and charges for Australian companies and owner-drivers at ports across Australia.

        are significantly raising their fees by a whopping 52.52 per cent in Melbourne, 38.8 per cent in Sydney and 37.5 per cent in Brisbane. The company is also significantly raising import fees and various other charges on owner-drivers and low-margin transport companies by double-digit percentages. At the same time, DP World is refusing to come to the table and negotiate in good faith with its workforce and the

       <p>
        We've got a foreign-state owned company extracting huge profits from vital national infrastructure, while ripping off their workforce and gouging Australian companies. Those opposite are always happy to cheer on shonky employers like DP World when they try and drive wages and conditions down. After all, low wages are a deliberate feature of Liberal-National coalition governments. I know which side I'm on. Be on the side of owner-drivers and hardworking maritime workers, and make sure that DP World does the right thing.
