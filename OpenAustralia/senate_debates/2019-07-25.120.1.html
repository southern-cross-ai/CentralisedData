         I thank Senator McGrath for that question and for his support for the alliance. The Australia-US alliance is the cornerstone of Australia's defence and security policy. The strength of our alliance is based on our common values, our shared vision and a commitment to peace, prosperity and stability in our immediate region and beyond. It's wonderful to note that we are now in the second century of unbroken mateship and global support and military co-operation. We have got 80 years of diplomatic relations and nearly 70 years of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS
         </a>
         co-operation. Our alliance is stronger than ever. It has never been more important or more vital to us than it is today, because today Australia faces challenges that are increasing in number and complexity, challenges that are rapidly redefining our strategic environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Morrison government recognises that a modern and enduring Australia-US alliance is critical if we are to respond to these challenges effectively. This is the message I relayed recently to the very newly appointed
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Secretary_of_Defense" rel="nofollow">

         , Mark Esper. I warmly congratulate him on his confirmation and I look forward to working with him.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is committed to further deepening our defence co-operation with the US, including through the US Force Posture Initiatives. We're working together to step up engagement with regional countries in the Indo-Pacific, with our neighbours and friends, and we are doing it together.

            reflects the strengths of the Australia-US alliance and the closeness of our military-to-military relationship. It is our largest and most complex exercise. Over 34,000 military personnel from Australia and the United States participated in Talisman Sabre this year. Talisman Sabre took place at the Defence Shoalwater Bay training area and surrounding state forest near Rockhampton and other locations in Queensland. Force elements from Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom and

            joined in Talisman Sabre.
           </p>
           <p>
            Talisman Sabre provided an excellent opportunity to further enhance interoperability between Australia and the United States. I'm delighted to report to the Senate that our people, our men and women of the ADF, once again did a magnificent job and did us all proud. I take this opportunity to thank the local community, including landowners, state governments and also the traditional owners. Without their generous support this could not have happened.

               As I announced earlier today, the Marine Rotational Force-Darwin reached a major milestone this week, with 2,500 US marines now in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                Northern Territory
               </a>
               . The force has grown in size and complexity since the first rotation of 200 in 2012. This current rotation represents the most capable and operationally focused deployment to date.
              </p>
              <p>
               Delivering on this commitment demonstrates the enduring nature of the US-Australia alliance and our shared intent to fully implement the US force posture initiatives. The Marine Rotational Force-Darwin provides critical strategic and security benefits for both Australia and the United States. By us training together, the warfare fighting capabilities and interoperability of the ADF and the US forces is enhanced. The rotation also provides opportunities to strengthen engagement with other allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region.
