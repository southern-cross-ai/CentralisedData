            Off the top of my head, Senator Patrick, and I will come back to the chamber and plead ignorance if I get it wrong, I interpret the previous motion as suspending so much of standing orders as would allow Senator Gallagher to do this, which includes the suspension of the temporary order you referred to. If I'm wrong, I apologise in advance and I'll correct myself in the chamber and make sure it doesn't happen again.

                 Parties may wish to vote differently if this were to occur in future. We also would normally exercise our right to seek leave to make a short statement to explain our voting position, which we were going to do in relation to the complex foreign policy motion that your party put, Senator Gallagher. We welcome that as a change of position on being able to debate complex foreign policy matters in this chamber and we look forward to you doing the same thing to us when we seek to move similar motions, but we also remain opposed to the restriction on motions. It has a disproportionate effect on crossbenchers and the Greens, and we continue to push to be able to use our democratic rights even where it's inconvenient to put you on the spot for your own policy positions.

                  In clarification of that, Senator Waters, I will seek advice if this matter comes up again. But, unless there is a strenuous objection from the chamber, I'm going to extend the courtesy of allowing these motions to be voted on separately as I would separate clauses of motions if senators wish to vote differently, and indicate that they will be voting differently, on them. Now, unless there's a strenuous objection—we haven't had this circumstance before—I intend to extend that courtesy. Again, if I'm wrong, it won't happen again, but the Clerk has said to me by message that my previous ruling was correct.
