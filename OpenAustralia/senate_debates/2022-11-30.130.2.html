        I want to make a few remarks with leave of the Senate to explain the changes that we've made. I thank colleagues for discussing the Senate program and the estimates hearings. We have been working with senators to tweak the program that was circulated constructively, as Senator Chisholm said. The original program did not have estimates in February, as there had not been a MYEFO since the budget. The budget served as the MYEFO. The estimates hearings are being conducted, and in fact they're still under way. The next scheduled estimates would be after the budget. However, we have responded to the feedback from the Senate that they would like estimates in February. The government will agree to that. So one of the amendments is to have the week of 13 February to Friday 17 February removed as a sitting week and inserted as estimates. I would like to thank Senator Hanson-Young for discussions about how to accommodate the wishes of the Senate for an extra estimates week.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's a further amendment which would move the June sittings up by a week and also remove the 'if required' out of that final sitting week in December. I thank colleagues for constructively engaging where they have. We've been able to respond as much as we can to get a sitting program for next year that meets everybody's needs, ensures we can get the business done and that we're responding to the wishes of the Senate for an extra estimates week.

         by leave—Imagine the Labor-Greens outrage if a coalition government had sought to axe one week of the traditional four weeks of Senate estimates. Imagine the even greater outrage if this was done, along with other unprecedented changes to the sitting schedule, without any consultation having occurred across the chamber. The outrage would have been off the Richter scale from Labor and the Greens. While we have seen in question time yesterday and today Senator Wong show a level of outrage at being questioned over the sitting schedule, I welcome this tweak, as the Manager of Government Business has described it, to the government's program. That's more than a tweak. Let me welcome this backflip and capitulation by the government to reinstate the four weeks of Senate estimates. They should never have sought to axe it. The attempt to axe a week of Senate estimates was clearly—

            To wrap up. This attempt to axe a week was clearly an attempt by the government to take an axe to the conventional transparency and accountability processes and procedures of the Senate. It was extraordinary to see the Greens also play patsy to this attempt to erode Senate accountability, but I do thank all six crossbench senators for standing firm with the coalition in support of Senate conventions. I acknowledge and welcome the government's backflip and, with that, indicate the opposition will not be proceeding with the amendments circulated in my name.

               Thank you, colleagues; I'm sorry to do this again. The first one was a referral to the

               for the structure of the Fridays, which Senator Ruston and others had requested. I've signed that letter, so that's done, just to let you know. So we'll have discussions about the routine of business for the day. On the second point, which was raised by Senator Pocock about Fridays, and acknowledging the issues that have been raised,

               wasn't just around being family friendly; it was also around hours of work. By having an extra working day, we are hopeful that we can reduce the requirement for senators to work 16- to 20-hour days and sit extended hours, which has directly contributed to a poor workplace culture for staff, which we are trying to address.

                Order, Senator Davey! I remind senators that this question was well ventilated at question time, to the point that the whole chamber was out of order. I'm asking for quiet now.
