        , Senator Wong. Has the government given consideration to the impact of the carbon tax on the value of assets, and in particular plant and equipment, owned by those companies liable to pay the tax? Has the government made any provision in its modelling for the inevitable reduction in the capital value of those assets?

            , on a point of order: I think I have a reasonably clear idea of what Senator Wong proposes to say and, may I say, I welcome her correction at the appropriate time. But it is not a proper use of the short period of time allowed for her to answer a question to use that time to correct the record from yesterday's

             , on the point of order: I have never yet seen a point of order taken on something someone might say. I have always appreciated that George can see into the future. Senator Brandis has enormous forward vision, but to actually take a point of order on something that somebody might say is a little unusual. Perhaps he might want to be ruled out of order, Mr President.

              The opening statement by the minister was that the minister was going to correct the record from a question that was asked yesterday. The appropriate time to do that is at the end of question time, and always has been.

              I am not going to get into an argument; I am just telling you what the practice and the procedure in this place have been for a long period of time. The minister has one minute and 41 seconds remaining to address the question that was asked by Senator Brandis. I invite the minister to answer the question.

                , I rise on a point of order. The minister is openly defying your ruling. You have just said that the time to correct the record is after question time and that the minister must come to the question. The question had nothing to do with petrol; the question had to do with the effect on asset values of the carbon tax. You should direct the minister to answer the question. If she continues to defy the ruling, she should be directed to resume her seat.

                      First, I do not believe any particular industry was indentified—which, in any event, would make the question difficult to respond to. In the context of the

                       CPRS
                      </a>
                      , the government obviously did look at the value of assets in the electricity sector. The senator would be very aware of the policy the government put previously before this parliament, which looked at the energy sector and the argument about the loss of asset value, which was part of the energy security assistance scheme that was included in the CPRS.

                       , I ask a supplementary question. Is it not the case that any decline in asset values of the companies affected by the carbon tax will be borne by the shareholders and investors in those companies, including those super­annuation funds entrusted with the retirement savings of millions of Australians?

                        If you look at, for example, what a number of investors of those funds have said publicly, you will see that there has been a very clear view about the importance of dealing with the uncertainty that currently exists around carbon pricing, because, of course, uncertainty creates a greater perception of risk. That is one of the reasons that the government is so clear about the importance of proceeding with what is a very economically sensible policy. I am not sure if the senator is aware of the Investor Group on
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
                         Climate Change

                        and the range of investors who have spoken about the need to end the uncertainty that has been brought about as a result of the actions of those on that side of the parliament, but it is very clear that business certainty will be best met if we can finally clarify the design of a price on carbon and carry that legislation through this place.

Can the minister assure the Senate that, when the government reveals the detail of the carbon price this Sunday, that announcement will include an announcement of the provisions it intends to make to safeguard the retirement savings of Australians affected by a decline in the share price through a decline in the asset values of the thousand or so companies directly affected by the carbon tax?

You opposed it when it was first introduced by Labor, you continue to oppose a lift in the superannuation rate for working Australians and you come in here and talk to us about retirement savings. People in this country understand which is the party of superannuation, which is the party that has been prepared to add to the retirement savings of working Australians, and it is the
