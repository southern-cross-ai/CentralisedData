         National Broadband Network

        How can the minister claim that Telstra’s letter can be formally considered under this process?

          Senator Conroy, resume your seat. It is disorderly to debate this across the chamber when we are trying to hear Senator Conroy and get an answer to the question that was asked by Senator Birmingham. I ask senators to desist. Senator Conroy, you are entitled to be heard in silence.

           This proposal included a signed proponent’s declaration form. Yesterday morning, Telstra released a media statement in which Telstra chairman, Don McGauchie, stated:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Telstra believes the Government can consider its proposal under the existing terms of the

          <p class="italic">
           It’s a request for proposals. We put in a proposal. We believe it enables us to be assessed.

          <p>
           They are certainly more right than those opposite. In this context we have said that Telstra’s proposal will be assessed against the RFP by the expert panel in exactly the same way as those of all other bidders. To do otherwise could unnecessarily expose the government to legal action. The government’s

             , I ask a supplementary question. The minister seems to be suggesting that Telstra, rather than the government, are setting the rules for this process. If the minister wants to quote Telstra, my supplementary question is as follows: Telstra equally said that they were unable to submit a full and detailed bid as part of the minister’s tender process. In light of this, and given the Auditor-General’s advice, how can the minister justify allowing Telstra’s letter to be formally considered under exactly the same process as other full and detailed bids, directly in contravention of what seems to be the Auditor-General’s own advice?

                    It is because we take the integrity of this process very seriously. Unlike those opposite—and I am hearing continual interjections from Senator Coonan—we are not going to do what Senator Coonan did last year—

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. The minister indicated in his opening answer that the government did not wish to be exposed to unnecessary legal risks. Does the minister accept that his whole process is at risk of becoming a farce if Telstra’s letter, rather than its full and detailed bid, is in fact treated equally to all other formal bids? In terms of the legal risk, does the minister agree that other compliant bidders, who have lodged full and detailed bids, may have every right to challenge such a decision if the government ignores the Auditor-General’s advice?

                      We are committed to conducting a fair, equal assessment process. As I said, Senator Birmingham, you have a copy of the

                      . Let me be clear: I did see some commentary yesterday from some members of the opposition, less informed than you, who claimed that there were threats that legal action would be taken if the Telstra document were admitted. I note that you chose not to name anybody.

                        You have every opportunity in the take note of answers debate after question time to name a company that has suggested that it is considering legal advice. You are welcome to name it. You are welcome to name anyone who has suggested that. What we have to do is follow the process set in train. We will not do what Senator Coonan did last year, when she was running this portfolio—that is, start a process and then, halfway through it, change the goalposts and only tell one bidder. And, funnily enough, the one bidder was the winning bidder. Twenty-seven other bidders did not even know the process had been changed—
