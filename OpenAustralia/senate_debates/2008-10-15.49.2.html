         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill amends the Archives Act 1983 to improve record-keeping arrangements across the Commonwealth.

        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed amendments are required to enable the legislation to “catch up” with changes in administrative practice across the Commonwealth.  The Bill gives effect to recommendations of the ALRC made 10 years ago.  A Bill, in virtually identical terms, was previously introduced in September 2006 but did not proceed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As the vast majority of records are now created and stored electronically it is highly desirable that these records are transferred as soon as possible to the care of the Archives before changes in technology render them inaccessible.  The bill addresses this by requiring records to be transferred as soon as they are no longer required to be readily available by an agency, instead of after 25 years as currently required under the Act.

       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to extend the deadline for commercial broadcasters to commence digital radio services in the mainland state capital cities by 6 months to 1 July 2009; to remove the requirement for commercial broadcasters to commence digital radio services in Hobart by the extended deadline of 1 July 2009; and to retain an option for community radio stations to take up shares in the joint venture companies managing the transmission of digital radio services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Digital radio services are legislated to start in the six state capitals by not later than 1 January 2009.  It has become apparent that the radio industry will have difficulty in meeting this deadline due to the limited availability of transmission equipment installers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill provides for a more appropriate commencement timeframe, with commercial digital radio services in the mainland state capitals to start not later than 1 July 2009. The bill also removes the requirement for services to be extended to Hobart within the same timeframe due to its relatively small population size and fewer number of commercial radio stations.  Broadcasters in Hobart will have the opportunity to commence digital radio services at the same time as other markets of comparable size, such as Geelong, Newcastle and Wollongong.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of this bill in the Spring sittings is necessary as the current legislation provides limited scope for a start date to be determined at any point after 1 January 2009.  Broadcasters and transmitter licence holders may also be subject to enforcement sanctions if they are unable to meet the January 2009 deadline.

        The new tax protocol with South Africa will broadly update the taxation arrangements between Australia and South Africa.  The new taxation arrangements will enhance Australia’s relationship with South Africa by further assisting trade and investment flows.

        Further, passage in the 2008 Spring sittings of the

         South African
        </a>
        protocol will allow the protocol to enter into force by the end of 2008.  South Africa are in the process of changing their domestic laws for taxation of corporate profits.  Completion of South Africa’s domestic tax changes is contingent on the renegotiation of a number of South Africa’s tax treaties including concluding a new tax protocol with Australia.
