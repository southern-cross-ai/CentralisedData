        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Senator Lundy. My question refers to the Wyndham Early Learning Activity centre, called WELA. It is a highly regarded community centre in the Kimberley. The community run initiative has been built up over a number of years and delivers programs that are helping to close the gap in Wyndham. In fact, the Prime Minister was so supportive of it she opened a brand new $1.7 million centre this time last year. However, is the government aware that as of next month this service will be reduced from five staff to just two part-time staff, delivering just 11 hours of programs a week and that this is largely due to the fact that the Parental and Community Engagement Program, PaCE, has not been refunded? Could the government please explain why this program has not been refunded and what they are doing to support this very important community centre?

         The Parental and Community Engagement Program is a community-driven program for parents and carers of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         children and young people. Contrary to Senator Siewert's question, as announced in the 2014 budget, the Australian government will continue to support a number of programs at national level, including programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people. We have decided to continue the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) program for a further five years and from 1 January 2014 funding will be provided through an annual appropriation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Siewert, I will take on notice specific information about the centre that you mention. But, in doing so, I would like to remind my Senate colleagues of the nature of the program, as it supports families and communities to be involved in their children's education by helping them connect with schools to get the best results for their children, helping them build relationships with principals and teachers and supporting them to help children and young people to learn at home. Indeed, since the program started in 2009, over $100 million has been provided by the Australian government to support 583 diverse projects across all states and territories, aimed at approximately 53,000 parents and carers and a further 28,000 community members. Parents play a vital role in their children's learning and development and the PaCE Program continues to make a real difference in this area. I have a number of examples of the effective operation of the PaCE Program. I am unable to respond to the specific centre raised and I have already said that I will take that part of the question on notice.

          , I ask a supplementary question. As of yesterday, the centre still did not know if it was going to get funding and be able to continue this very important program after 30 June. They will be losing the majority of their staff and a program that has won awards at the state and the national level. What is happening with Wyndham? Why don't they know if they are being refunded? Why haven't they had a response from the Prime Minister, who has been written to about this specific issue?

           I think I have already made clear that I will take the specifics of the Wyndham centre on notice with respect to this program. But I am very pleased to reiterate that this is a program we are continuing, to the point where, from 1 January next year, it will continue as an annual appropriation. It is a remarkable program and it is flexible as well. One of the attributes of the PaCE Program is that a project can vary from a one-day workshop to one that may go on for one or two years, depending on what the community is seeking, what they are looking for and what they are trying to achieve. Aboriginal and

           </a>
           parents and families are encouraged to put forward ideas for funding to support projects that align with their local needs, to build those relationships between families, their communities and their schools.
          </p>
          <p>
           I can only reiterate that we have continued the program and we are very pleased about that. I think Senator Siewert has acknowledged the value of the program and perhaps was not aware that we announced this in the budget—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. This centre is going to have no staff as of the end of June. It is likely that other centres around Australia, given what you have just said about the funding gap, will be in exactly the same position. How many other early learning centres around Australia are going to have this gap in funding and may not get their funding renewed? Because there is no guarantee that they will.

             I have already said I cannot address the specifics, but perhaps I can give some relevant contextual information about the nature of the projects that PaCE does continue to fund. One example is the Ipswich PaCE project, where parents and carers have been supported through a successful elders education support group. The group plays an active role within the school and associated community events by empowering parents and carers—

If the minister has information on the value of this program, she should also know how many centres are funded.

                I do not have that information at hand. I am happy to take that information on notice also, but the point remains that Senator Siewert is obviously not familiar with the budget announcement that we made and the fact that we are continuing this program as an annual item for the next five years.
