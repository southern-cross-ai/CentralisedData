               The government will not be supporting this motion. The government has acted on the advice of our security agencies in relation to the reporting of the use of special-purpose aircraft. It was a clear recommendation of the agencies that the level of information published in the reports was not fit for purpose in the current security environment. The Albanese government is committed to transparency, and that is why, following the security review and the presentation of the updated guidelines, we restarted publishing the reports. We published the information that is safe to publish and that reflects the advice of our security agencies. The fact that we are debating it demonstrates that we are accountable. That is why we restarted reporting in line with the security advice after the opposition stopped publishing these reports without explanation or reason during the last 18 months of their government.
