        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner. Can the Minister outline to the Senate the new leadership arrangements in Oruzgan province? Can he further inform the Senate whether he is satisfied that these arrangements will be in place before the Dutch troops start their withdrawal on 1 August this year?

         I thank Senator Hutchins for his question. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have just announced the new arrangements for the international mission in Oruzgan province. The Australian government welcomes the decision by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
          NATO
         </a>
         to establish a new multinational command structure for Oruzgan province to replace the Netherlands contribution from 1 August this year. These new arrangements will see the United States lead a multinational combined team Oruzgan under an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
          ISAF
         </a>
         flag. This approach will serve our interests well and will also provide a strategy that will allow us to continue to build on progress that we have made in Oruzgan.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are pleased to announce that Australia will make a significant contribution to the integrated civilian and military provincial reconstruction team. This will include having an Australian civilian lead the provincial reconstruction team. Our mission in Oruzgan remains focused on training the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Afghan National Army
         </a>
         4th Brigade so it is able to assume responsibility for security in Oruzgan province. I am very confident that NATO has found a solution that supports both Australia’s interests and also the interests of Afghanistan and its people.

           The details of the United States contribution are of course for the United States to announce, but I am confident that the proposed arrangements will more than adequately match the role previously performed by the Dutch. Australia is one of 46 countries contributing to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
            ISAF
           </a>
           . With 45 partners and the Afghan national security forces, we are playing our part in a coordinated and comprehensive campaign. In Oruzgan, Australia would be working with the United States as well as our ISAF partners Slovakia and Singapore and, again, the Afghan national security forces. Of course, Australia would welcome any ongoing contribution from our Dutch partners in Oruzgan province.

             I recently tasked Defence to provide updated advice on the time frame for our mission.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
              CDF
             </a>
             has advised me that, on the basis of solid progress in our training efforts to date, Defence now estimates that within two to four years we will be able to transition the main security responsibility for the province to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army" rel="nofollow">
              Afghan National Army
             </a>
             . On completion of our training mission, I expect that we will adjust our force levels as the ADF training mission transitions into an overwatch role. Our troops, of course, performed this role in Iraq for some 12 months. While this is the best advice I can provide the Senate, timing the transition of security to the Afghan national security forces of course depends on the conditions that apply on the ground at the time.
