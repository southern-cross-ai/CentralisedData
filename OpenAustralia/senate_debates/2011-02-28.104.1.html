        I am very pleased this evening to congratulate the winners and runners-up of the Australian government’s Simpson Prize for 2011. The Simpson Prize is a popular national history competition for year 9 and year 10 students which recognises the significance of the Australian Anzac tradition. This morning, I joined the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Garrett" rel="nofollow">

        , who presented prizes to the winners and runners-up from each state and territory. All the recipients are in Canberra today and tomorrow to attend a two-day briefing program, which includes visits to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        , the

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . As part of their award, the eight winners as well as two teachers will travel to Gallipoli to take part in an 11-day exploration program and attend the Anzac Day commemorative service. This morning I had the privilege of meeting the Victorian winner, Lauren McAlary, from

        in Gardenvale, and the Victorian runner-up, Thomas Posa, from

        . One of the teachers is Ms Geraldine Carrodus from

        It is notable that more than 600 students from nearly 100 schools submitted either a 900- to 1,200-word essay or a 15-minute audio-visual presentation responding to the question ‘Has the Anzac legend changed over 95 years?’. In responding to the question, students had to investigate and consider at least two periods of Australian history. In doing so, these students demonstrated how the Anzac tradition is still very much a part of who we are today. The Australian government provided $186,000 to fund the award, which is now in its 13th year. Beginning in 1998, the award honours
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Simpson_Kirkpatrick" rel="nofollow">
         John Simpson Kirkpatrick
        </a>
        , better known as ‘the man with the donkey’, who was famous for his bravery as a stretcher bearer at Gallipoli in 1915. Simpson was among those who landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, and was killed after just three weeks by a Turkish bullet while trying to retrieve wounded men. Simpson remains one of the most famous figures who served at Gallipoli. This award honours his memory and gives today’s eight winners the opportunity to visit Gallipoli—a life-changing experience that they will never forget.

        students should have the opportunity to study history, because history is not just about the past; it helps us understand the present. It is worth noting that late last year the Australian curriculum for history was endorsed by federal, state and territory ministers, and that it will be implemented this year. This landmark decision will help deliver a world-class Australian curriculum that will benefit all Australian students, families and teachers. As Minister Garrett said today:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Curriculum will deliver a consistent, rigorous and engaging approach to history education for every student in the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the work and contribution of the History Teachers’ Association of Australia and its state affiliates, which have conducted this competition on behalf of the Australian government. It is days like Anzac Day and events like this competition that serve as powerful reminders of this country’s enduring Anzac spirit and that help us remember and honour all those Australians who have served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations.
