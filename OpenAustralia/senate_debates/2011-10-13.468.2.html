        On 12 October Senator Fifield asked me a question about disability enterprises and the carbon price. I seek leave to incorporate additional information in response to the senator's question in my capacity representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

         The answer read as follows—

       <p class="italic">
        Australian Disability Enterprises are not-for profit community organisations that provide employment opportunities in competitive business operations for people with moderate to severe disability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Low Carbon Communities program is an important part of the Government's plan for a Clean Energy Future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It supports community organisations like Australian Disability Enterprises to understand and improve their energy efficiency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Low Carbon Communities initiative includes:

       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Through this year's Budget, the Government also provided an extra $6.67 million in extra funding to

        s for 2011-12 — a 3.3 per cent increase for the sector. This included:

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator McLucas was pleased to call for applications for the capital fund early last month. Australian Disability Enterprises can apply for grants up to $20,000 from this fund for capital improvements that enhance their business viability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most workers in Australian Disability Enterprises are also receiving the Disability Support Pension. Through this, they will be eligible for support under the Household Assistance Package.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians receiving Disability Support Pension will receive assistance equivalent to a 1.7 per cent increase in the maximum rate of the pension.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This means a Disability Support Pensioner on the single rate will receive $338 per year in carbon price assistance and a Disability Support Pension recipient who is the member of a couple will receive $255 per year extra.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This assistance will more than offset the average expected carbon price impact on their cost of living (a modest 0.7 per cent increase to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">

        — less than one cent for every dollar spent).

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        understands the financial pressures on people with disability and their carers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why we have delivered historic increases to the Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment ($148 per fortnight for singles and $146 per fortnight for couples combined), improved indexation to both of these payments, and introduced a new $600 annual Carer Supplement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In shaping the Carbon Price Household Assistance, we have ensured that assistance is provided to low and middle income households and the community organisations that support them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government will continue to work with Australian Disability Enterprises to help them continue their good work with Australians with disability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are working with disability advocates and Australian Disability Enterprises to develop a ten year Vision for supported employment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will work toward improving access for people with disability who need supported employment, improve the experiences of people with disability in supported employment, and strengthening Australian Disability Enterprises as progressive and sustainable organisations providing inclusive supported employment.
