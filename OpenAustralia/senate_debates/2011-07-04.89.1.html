        contract for Australia's free-to-air international tele­vision network. Is it a fact that the recommendation on the successful tenderer was originally to be made by an independent panel of public servants and that this panel favoured the proposal from Sky News over the ABC?

         I thank Senator Abetz for his question.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         . On 23 November 2010, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Kevin Rudd MP, announced the government's decision to open a public tender for a 10-year contract for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Network" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Network
         </a>
         . A competitive tender process ensures the best return on the government's investments. Moving the Australia Network service to a 10-year contract will provide greater certainty to the service provider. The tender opened on 4 February 2011 and initially closed on 25 March 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has approved a maximum of $223.1 million for the contract, excluding
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         , which represents the current contract cost of $94.2 million over five years with an adjustment for inflation. In light of changed international circumstances since the request for tender was issued, the government has decided that national interests should be addressed more broadly. Tenderers have been asked to submit amended bids to specifically address how their operation of the Australia Network service would meet Australia's national interests in light of the increasing influence of key emerging markets on the global economy. Given the significance of the tender to Australia's national interests, the government considers that the decision should be taken at a ministerial level. As I have responsibility for broadcasting and communications policy, the government decided that I was the most appropriate minister to take on the approver role. Prior to this decision, I had no role in the process. However, this process will continue to be administered—

           The process will continue to be administered by the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. The amended
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFT" rel="nofollow">
            RFT
           </a>
           will be released shortly and a decision on the preferred tenderer is expected to be taken by September 2011. Both tenderers will be given an equal and reasonable opportunity to respond to the additional criteria. The current contract between
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
            DFAT
           </a>
           and the ABC expires on 8 August 2011. Accordingly, the government will exercise its option under the existing contract to extend the service operated by the ABC for six months until 8 February 2012. On the range of other issues, I addressed those questions in my earlier answer.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. The minister still has not told the Senate what changed after 4 February 2011 in relation to international circumstances requiring the change of tender. What role does the minister now have in determining the successful tenderer? Given the minister's responsibility for the ABC, doesn't he have a potential conflict of interest?

The cabinet believes that this is a cabinet-level decision. So that is my function. I have been appointed the approver, but the decision is a cabinet decision.
