        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer and Minister representing the Minister for

               I have no doubt that Senator Birmingham, being an assiduous reader of Treasury documents, would have read the Treasury modelling which was released. The assumptions on a whole range of issues, including the extent of international action, are described in the document itself. The core policy scenario assumes that nations—

                  As I was saying, the core policy scenario in the Treasury modelling assumes that countries meet the low-end commitments for 2020 that they made at the Copenhagen and the Cancun conferences. This is the equivalent of assuming Australia will meet its bipartisan five per cent target by 2020. I remind those opposite that it is like assuming this nation will meet the target that both parties have committed to, although I note at this point that the opposition's policy to meet the five per cent will, in fact, cost more. It will cost $1,300 per year per Australian household. It is a policy which will increase expenses for Australian taxpayers. The approach taken by Treasury is the same approach taken in comparable modelling exercises by organisations such as the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
                   OECD
                  </a>
                  , and the commitments on which this is predicated are the clearest evidence that we have of what other countries intend to do to tackle climate change.

                   , I have a supplementary question for Minister Wong. I note the minister did not address the period beyond 2020 and I refer the minister to statements made by Treasury officials to the inquiry into the carbon tax bills that they have modelled a scheme for after 2020, where countries make the same emissions reductions as each other, relative to their business as usual path, by the same amount as Australia. Is it correct that Treasury modelling assumes all countries make the same reductions against business as usual after 2020? If so, what is the amount of that reduction?

                    Let us understand what the question is proposing. The opposition is suggesting that another reason to oppose this bill, to which they are already so implacably opposed, is because of something which may or may not happen between 2020 and 2050. We know something that is likely to happen in the decades ahead if the world, including Australia, does not act on climate change—that is, climate change will worsen and the economy in this nation and globally will be hit by that. Those on that side—

                      . The question was specific: whether or not there was an assumption and what was the amount of the reduction. The minister has done nothing but critique the question. She has not attempted to answer the question. She has not approached the question, let alone been directly relevant to it. You should bring her to the question.

                        As I said, the Treasury modelling is quite transparent in the various assumptions it makes. As I have outlined, it makes assumptions consistent with the approach taken by analogous modelling exercises such as those undertaken by the

                        . But the point is the opposition do not care about the modelling.

                         , I have a further supplementary question for Minister Wong. Is it not true that the Treasury modelling of the Gillard government's carbon tax assumes all countries engage in an 80 per cent reduction in emissions against business as usual between 2020 and 2050? Given the minister's personal experience of events like the Copenhagen conference, does the minister agree that this is a most heroic assumption on which to punt Australia's future?

                          , the heroic assumption is that at some point the opposition might actually care about the national interest. That would be an heroic assumption. The heroic assumption would be that at some point, instead of running around talking about pledges written in blood, those opposite might actually care about public policy and reform for the future. The heroic assumption might be that those on the other side, who are part of a policy to put a price on carbon, might discover their consciences at some point and recall that they went to an election promising this for the same reasons.
