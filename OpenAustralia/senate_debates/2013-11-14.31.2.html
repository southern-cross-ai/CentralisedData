           I am pleased to be able to co-sign this motion with Senator Lundy to establish a select committee into the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           . On 17 October I wrote to our new communications minister, Mr Turnbull, congratulating him on his appointment and asking him his intentions for re-establishing the Joint NBN Committee—which I, government members, coalition members and Senator Xenophon were involved in creating—an oversight committee to watchdog the rollout of the NBN, which, as we know, was very popular but was also troubled. The committee played quite a valuable role under the chairmanship of Mr Oakeshott.
          </p>
          <p>
           While in opposition Mr Turnbull participated in that committee. I think all members who participated got value out of it. I had no response from Mr Turnbull. He has not re-established the Joint NBN Committee and I do not believe he that he intends to. That is why this select committee is necessary—to police, to the degree that we can, the shambles that is now being presided over, given that anybody with any knowledge of construction of that network is being washed out of the organisation. It is absolutely essential for an investment of this scale, given the privatisation mentality that this government seems to be bringing to the debate, that we salvage whatever we can from the wreckage that Mr Turnbull is now presiding over. So I would encourage members from all sides of this chamber to participate and to do what we can to retrieve the best we can from the wreckage of this government's broadband policy.

              Almost everything that Senator Ludlam said was untrue. The government took the initiative and proposed that the

               Joint Committee

              be re-established. The government approached Labor and secured in-principle support for the joint committee. But what we have actually witnessed and are witnessing is an effective coup within the opposition.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unbeknownst to the shadow communications minister, Mr Clare, Labor in the Senate, as we see here with Senator Ludlam, is launching a separate proposal for a committee. The government had taken steps to ensure that parliamentary scrutiny of this project would occur. We are very clear. But we will not be establishing the Joint Committee on the NBN if Labor insists on a separate committee in this place and if Labor, in effect, perpetrates a coup within their own ranks. What we are seeing is Labor senators freelancing and undermining—

                 Senator Ludlam will stop me if I am breaching confidence, but just chatting to Senator Ludlam he indicated to me that this motion was moved in frustration—because they were not told that the joint committee was going to resume. That being the case, I would move, if I am able to do so in this instance, that this matter be adjourned until a later hour.

                  No, that is not possible because formality was sought and given and there is a motion now before the chair, which I must consider and put. The motion before me now is that the motion moved by Senator Lundy be agreed to.
