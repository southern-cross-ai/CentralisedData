        Proportionally, Australia uses more methamphetamine that almost every country in the world. Today, evidence suggests that there are well over 200,000 ice users in Australia. It is an issue that I have raised here before, and it is regional Australia which is disproportionately affected. In the

        and the electorate of the Murray in the great state of Victoria, the abuse of drugs, and ice in particular, has been a significant problem. Unfortunately, Shepparton, the great regional capital, diverse and productive as it is, is known as the ice capitalâ€”not the vision we want for that area. Worsening drug, crime and violence statistics in regional Victoria do not adequately reflect the wider pain and anxiety felt by communities, day in and day out. The issue is raw and the drug is destructive, and it creates a great deal of fear and dysfunction in families.

        The ice task force travelled across Australia last year and, sadly, everyone has an anecdote about how ice is impacting on their cities, towns and communities, causing family violence and unemployment, putting ambulance officers, hospital workers and police at risk, and making our emergency wards dangerous places. I could go on. Once average conventional families are being torn apart by a family member's addiction. It is important that we continue the law enforcement efforts, but we need to continue our efforts in reducing demand and helping families, communities and frontline services to deal with this. There are often those in local areas who have local solutions, but they cannot do it alone. They require dedicated advocates in our parliament and our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Damian Drum, the Nationals candidate for the electorate of Murray, is one such advocate. He has brought this issue to my attention through his deep concern about the level of ice use in the Goulburn Valley. Tonight, he will be attending, along with so many other community members, a community meeting and ice forum at St Mary's Parish to discuss the social issue that has been devastating that community. Guest speakers include mental health worker Jenny O'Connell, Detective Senior Sergeant Paul Maher and Belinda Aitken, who appeared on

        player for the Cats, he has been a long-time supporter of ice rehabilitation facilities throughout northern Victoria. In his role as the member for Northern Victoria, he has been inspecting and advocating within the state parliamentary system for funds to extend rehabilitation service provision. His strong commitment, I am sure, will continue if he is elected to the other place to serve the people of Murray. Also, when he was Victorian Minister for Sport, he announced $300,000 for an inquiry into sport which looked at the use of drugs in sport. The local Goulburn Valley league has recognised that drugs within our football leagues in country Victoria are an issue, and Damian will take a leadership role.

        The Nationals have taken a leadership role in addressing this issue. Damian Drum is a man of conviction that drug and alcohol abuse in our regions threatens the very fabric of our communities. I am sure that he will stand shoulder to shoulder with the Goulburn Valley community, to advocate for them, to fight for them and to hold state and federal governments to account in dealing with the scourge of ice in the communities around the Goulburn Valley, whilst ensuring that health remains at the top of the agenda.
