        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. In November 2023 the Iranian ambassador posted antisemitic comments on social media which, in media reports, were condemned by an unnamed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT

        spokesperson. What action did the government take in November 2023 to ensure a foreign official would not continue to spread antisemitic hatred in Australia?

         In relation to the date in question, as opposed to the more recent one, I will get further information about the nature of representations which were made at the time. But I would say to you, Senator, I've made very clear public comments about the most recent comments by the Iranian ambassador. I said that this language was repugnant and hateful, and it has no place in our country. I said that publicly, and so did the Prime Minister. It was a terrible example of unacceptable language, and the ambassador has been left in no doubt about our position, and this matter has been handled appropriately by the department.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would say to you, Senator, because I've seen some of your colleagues' and your public remarks, that we retain diplomatic relations with countries not because of their interests but because of ours. We retain diplomatic relations so that we can advocate for Australia's interests and for Australia's citizens, some of whom at times are in trouble or incarcerated in the countries in question. That is why we have diplomatic relations with countries, notwithstanding that we have very different views on many issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         I again say those remarks were repugnant, and I want to express again that I understand how distressing they were for members of Australia's Jewish community. I hope they know that those of us in the government and in this parliament stand against that sort of antisemitism.

           In February this year

            DFAT
           </a>
           was alerted to complaints about the Iranian ambassador contacting Australian citizens online in a manner which made those Australians feel unsafe and feel that they were being monitored by the embassy. What action did the government take in February this year in response to those concerns?

            There has been a range of actions taken, including by the

            from memory, outlining the remedies and protections available under Australia's foreign interference regime that are available to Australians. My recollection is there has been engagement with the community on that. I think you have asked me this question before. I will get further information for you, if you wish, about those past activities, Senator Chandler.
           </p>
           <p>
            I again restate in here: we are very clear about our multicultural democracy. We are very clear with all concerned that we will defend that. Part of that is people are free to express their political views peacefully. Part of that is people are free; Australians should be safe from intimidation and coercion. They should be allowed to operate and exercise their voice in this country without fear of intimidation from any party.

              More than 10 months after the government was first alerted to antisemitic hatred being spread on social media by the Iranian ambassador, why is the ambassador still, this month, inciting hatred and calling for genocide without greater consequence than being asked to meet with a

               As I said to you, Senator, I think it is very clear, from the public comments made by the Prime Minister of Australia and the foreign minister and others, that our views about the ambassador's comments are that they were repugnant. This has been appropriately managed by senior people within the department and by the representations I made. As I said in my primary answer, we maintain diplomatic relations for our interests not because we agree with the views of the regimes that we deal with. I would remind the senator that Australia has had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1968. I join with you and others in our public condemnation of the ambassador's remarks and in the articulation of our support for Australia's Jewish community in the face of them.
