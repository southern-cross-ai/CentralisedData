        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. I refer to the documents tabled by Senator Colbeck yesterday, entitled
        <i>
         COVID vaccination allocations horizons
        </i>
        . Why is there no mention of the word 'target', and what precisely is meant by the new term 'horizons'?

         The document that I tabled yesterday, which was provided to the states by Lieutenant General Frewen on Monday, was to provide to the states and territories an indication of the vaccine volumes that will be provided to them on a weekly basis between now and the end of this calendar year. That is the point of that. That is a terminology that is a part of that document. It is about providing information to the states and territories so that they can adequately and appropriately plan their requirements for people to vaccinate Australians as the amounts of vaccine begin to grow towards the end of the year. This is about working with the states and assisting them with their planning in relation to the workforce they will need to roll out the vaccine so that Australians, as we have said on a number of occasions, have the opportunity to access a vaccine before the end of this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The document provides information as to the amount of vaccines of various types that will be provided to the states. It provides information about the volumes of vaccines that will be provided to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         s and through those various pathways that Australians will be able to access a vaccine by the end of this year. This is providing information to assist the states and territories and those that are working with the government on vaccinating Australians with the information they need for their logistical planning.

              I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. There was no preamble; it was a very direct question. If the minister misheard, it was specifically relating to workers in aged care and the disability sector.

               I have ruled previously that, when questions are very strictly worded and seek a statement of fact, the test of direct relevance is very strictly applied. The question I had—and I have allowed you to remind the minister—did refer, I believe, to aged-care and disability workers in

                   <p>
                    It's at times like this you think the opposition's ears might be painted on, because we have explained a number of times that, as the rollout of the vaccination process has occurred, we have had to change the way the rollout is occurring, based on the circumstances that have occurred. It's all very well for the opposition to repeat something that happened or was said in February and ignore everything that's happened between now and then. In fact, it's quite dishonest of them to continue to do that. We have had to make some adjustments to the rollout as circumstances have changed. We continue to work with the states and territories, using the information that we provided to them yesterday, so that Australians can get access to a vaccine and those that want one can do so by the end of this calendar year.
