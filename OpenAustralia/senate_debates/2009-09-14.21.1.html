                 I am genuinely putting this proposition, Senator Abetz. I know you find that difficult to comprehend. If you are interested in an international agreement then clearly financing is part of that. I suggest those on the other side who want to play a role internationally, those on the other side who say they want a global agreement—and there are many Liberals who do—consider with some—

                    Those on the other side who say they want a global response to climate change will have to deal with the fact that financing will be part of that agreement. That would be the case under our government or under your government. I remind you also that you and your leader have in fact said you want a global agreement.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    On the issue of financing, we have been very clear that this is a matter still for significant discussion and dialogue in the negotiations. We have been very clear that this is part of the whole of the negotiations for an international agreement. I have read with some concern Senator Boswell’s comments. Again I invite those who want to be sensible on this issue to remember that, if an international agreement is in Australia’s national interest, which it is, then Australia, like all other countries, will have to deal with the issue of financing. That is self-evident.

                     , I ask a supplementary question. Has the minister seen reports that the European Union suggest Australia pay $3.8 billion a year in overseas climate aid, which is close to our existing foreign budget? We need answers from the government before you go to Copenhagen with a blank cheque. How much money will come out of the Australian budget over the next few years to help developing countries tackle climate change?

                      I want to be clear that financing will require a multiplicity of financing vehicles and it will require significant leveraging of carbon markets. It will require significant leveraging of private sector investment through carbon markets. This is a complex discussion that is being negotiated both through the

                      </a>
                      and has also been discussed in the G20 context. Clearly, Australia will need to be part, as we are, of the current discussions and to be clear about this being part of the international negotiations. There have been no clear commitments made as yet, Senator Boswell, because these issues are still being negotiated. But I do want to again say to the Liberal Party: if you are serious about an international response to climate change, you cannot run away from this issue. And we invite the Liberal Party—

                          report—you have referenced both, Senator Boswell. I am not aware of the specific proposal that you reference, from what you say. I may well be, but I may not understand it in the way you describe it. What I can say is that there are a whole range of means by which financing may well be delivered. They do not simply involve public financing. They also necessarily involve private sector financing. That is why the role of carbon markets is so important. The nature of the transformation the world has to make during our lifetime is beyond the capacity of governments alone to fund. That is why policies such as the

                          and policies internationally that involve the development of carbon markets are so critical. These are issues to be negotiated. And, as I said, I invite the Liberal opposition to take a mature, sensible approach to this issue, because if you want to deal—
