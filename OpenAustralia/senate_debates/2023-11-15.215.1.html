        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. With no end in sight to Australia's cost-of-living crisis and with Labor policies like record immigration and increased public spending making inflation even worse than it needs to be, the Albanese government has substantially increased our foreign aid budget to over $5 billion per year across the forward estimates and has signalled more increases to come after. Is the Albanese Labor government in discussion about an increase on the $10 million of aid Australia has already provided to Gaza following the terrorist attacks in Israel?

         I think there are two parts to that question, Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanson" rel="nofollow">
          Hanson
         </a>
         . I will seek to address both of them. The first is in relation to foreign aid, and I appreciate you have a different view, but we do see development assistance as an element of our national power. It is an element of how we influence the world, and we do think there is obviously an ethical argument for making sure a child doesn't die and averting a death. That is a good thing for humanity. But there is also a very pragmatic and national security reason, which is we do better in a world where there is more stability and more prosperity, particularly in our region. We do better in a region that is more stable and more prosperous, and our development assistance is about trying to ensure that. So it is about the interests of Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think the question that you are asking goes to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Relief and Works Agency; I think that might be what you're referencing in terms of Gaza. I would just make the point that this is the only organisation with a mandate to provide basic services to the Palestinian people. Obviously, we all have a view about the abhorrent nature of Hamas, which, regrettably, retains much control in Gaza. The only way in which we can provide assistance in a sensible or legitimate way to the Palestinian people in Gaza and also in the

         . That is funding that was previously provided by both the Turnbull and the Abbott government. It is also funded by the United States, and Secretary of State Blinken has previously indicated that the

           HANSON (â€”) (): It was revealed on the weekend that Australians have been donating thousands of dollars to a charity founded by the Australian Palestine Advocacy Network president and terror apologist Nasser Mashni, which is funnelling the money to an aid organisation in Gaza accused of links to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front" rel="nofollow">
            Popular Front

           for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist group. Minister, what assurances do you offer the Australian people that their taxpayer dollars are not supporting terrorists?

            I will confirm this, Senator, but I think, having looked at this after the story broke, that that is not an entity the Australian government funds. The funding that we provide is through the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
             UN
            </a>

            â€”sorry, I'm quite tired. The entity that you describe is funded by private donation. That is my recollection. If I'm incorrect, I will come back to this chamber and clarify that with you.

              The Albanese government is increasing foreign aid, while the Australian people are experiencing a lower standard of living, declining access to health care, massive energy cost increases, rising crime and rising interest rates. When is the Albanese government going to stop putting the needs of foreign countries first, before Australia, when so many Australians are struggling and suffering?

               I'd make two points. As you would know, the government is very focused on the cost-of-living challenges that Australians are facing. That is why we saw some $23 billion worth of cost-of-living measures in the budget. That is why we are seeking to get wages moving again, and, as Senator Gallagher said in her first answer, we are very pleased to see how the figures released today show that wages are at a much better level than they have been for many years. Obviously, there's a lot more work to do, and we know how inflation is a challenge within the economy and for families, but this is what we are focused on: how do we ensure that wages get moving and how do we deal with cost-of-living matters? In relation to development assistance, I'd refer you to the strategic argument I put in my first answer.
