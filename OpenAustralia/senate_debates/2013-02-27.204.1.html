       <p>
        asked the Minister for Tourism, upon notice, on 28 November 2012:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Given that, in 2009, the Minister for Tourism, Mr Martin Ferguson, encouraged tourism operators via the climate change guide Mitigation and Adaptation Measures for Australian Tourism Operators to ''Firstly, think about the major costs and environmental impacts of your business. This may involve looking through your electricity, gas and water bills, looking at your accounts to see how much fuel you have used, working out how much time and money you spend on sourcing materials and services, costing your maintenance activities, or seeing what your staff ongoings are'', has the department sought to engage with individual tourism operators since the introduction of the Carbon Tax to ascertain what extra ''carbon charges'' they now face, and what this means to their viability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) What modelling has the department undertaken since the introduction of the Carbon Tax to determine the impact on tourism operators of the additional pressures from 2014, when the private vehicle fuel exemption will no longer apply to heavy vehicles.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Why has the department refused at successive estimates hearings to undertake Carbon Tax impact analysis on behalf of the 350 000 tourism connected businesses in the Australian market?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Is the Minister aware that Mr Kevin Rudd stated via Twitter on 4 October 2012, that ''The front desks of all our major hotels must have Chinese language skills for the future. So too with guided tours''.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) What proportion of Australia's 350 000 tourism connected businesses employ staff with a Chinese language ability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Is this considered a central part of being ''China-ready''?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) What consideration is being given to linking tourism businesses with staff that have a Chinese language ability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8) With reference to the Strategic Tourism Investment Grant awarded to ensure Australian Tourism is ''China-ready'': (a) how much was awarded under this grant and to whom; (b) what has been achieved under this project; and (c) what does the department aim to achieve before its completion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (9) With reference to the policy to drive China-readiness, are there plans to better utilise the Chinese language skills of Australians who speak fluent Chinese, or international students who are permitted to undertake limited work while studying in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (10) Given that the Government has invested $1 million via the Australian Tourism Data Warehouse (ATDW) to translate websites of Australian tourism connected businesses into Chinese and other world languages: (a) is the Minister aware of concerns that automated language translation leads to confusing broken Chinese messages; (b) has the department sought or received advice that automated translation services create perceptions that the businesses they represent are similarly lacking in quality; and (c) what is being done to resolve both these issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (11) Given that, since Mr Rudd was Prime Minister, Australian receipts from international education have declined by $3.6 billion, and that the international education sector is an important part of the tourism market, how is the department working to ensure that this trend is reversed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (12) With reference to the early 2012 pre-Budget submission of the Tourism and Transport Forum indicating that, under a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Coalition Government
        </a>
        , Australia earned a net profit of $3.6 billion from tourism, while in 2012, Australia is forecast to lose $8.7 billion in the tourism sector, what is being done to stem the overall net decline of Australia's tourism performance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (13) Can the department confirm that: (a) the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_World_Tourism_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations World Tourism Organisation
        </a>

         UNWTO
        </a>

         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        has highlighted that Australians took 8 million overseas trips in 2011, and spent 139 million nights abroad.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (14) How much did Australians spend on overseas trips in 2011, and how does this compare to: (a) spending by international visitors to Australia; and (b) the long term average.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (15) With reference to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum" rel="nofollow">
         World Economic Forum
        </a>
        system of ranking nations in international tourism competitiveness, what is the estimated impact the additional taxes and charges announced in the 2012 13 Budget will have on Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (16) What impact has the 100 departmental staff cuts, announced at the end of 2011, had on the department's ability to manage ongoing projects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (17) Given that the 2012 13 Budget provided no funding for the continuation of the T-QUAL program, the only program solely devoted to assisting improvements in tourism products in Australia, can an outline be provided of what dedicated tourism programs will be available to assist struggling tourism businesses to rejuvenate tourism products.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (18) What proportion of the T QUAL program budget has been allocated to the quality accreditation process in relation to the small grants component.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (19) In terms of the quality assurance and standards accreditation system, has consideration been given to how effective the program is in replacing the previous 1 to 5 star ratings system, in particular: (a) has the department reviewed market testing of the efficacy of T QUAL accreditation (brand awareness); (b) what does T QUAL mean to the average Australian traveller; (c) is it a recognised and understood brand for inbound tourists; (d) how does it differ from the world's major accreditation schemes, and why are they more or less well understood; (e) does the UNWTO suggestion for mystery shoppers have merit; (f) do assessors have a clear checklist to remove subjectivity, ensure consistency across venues and drive continual improvement; (g) is there merit in the Australian Accommodation Association (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
         AAA
        </a>
        ) suggestion that T QUAL participation requires participation in an occupancy reporting regime (ABS/​
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STA" rel="nofollow">
         STA
        </a>
        Global); (h) should every hotel front desk carry a pamphlet explaining T QUAL and inviting feedback; (i) are there other metrics that should be reflected in the brand such as disability access; and (j) have any venues lost their T QUAL status.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (20) What are the criteria for T QUAL accreditation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (21) Has the department engaged in discussions across government departments and agencies with regard to the impact that the proposed mandatory pre commitment for poker machines will have on clubs in Australia; if so, what impact will the legislation have on clubs; if not, why not.

        </a>
        ; (b) when and for how long will the agreement come into effect; (c) how many ships per year will be allowed to use the facility and during which months; (d) will the cruise industry be charged for use of Garden Island; if so, how much; and (e) what is the economic benefit to Australia, including how many trips per year will this secure by giving the sector certainty, and what is the total in country spend, both in Sydney and other ports visited, as part of itineraries of these cruise liners.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (23) Has any research been undertaken into the impact of the Passenger Movement Charge increase from $47 to $55 per passenger, particularly with respect to Australia's favourability as a tourist destination.
       </p>

         Jackson Report

         (a) Tourism Australia undertook quantitative research distributed through a national online survey. The survey was completed by 1,522 respondents that had travelled domestically in the last six months. This research suggests that the 2011/​2012 consumer marketing campaign for T-QUAL Accreditation was successful with total consumer awareness of the marketing activity reaching 15 per cent (three times the campaign target of 5 per cent).

         (d) T-QUAL Accreditation operates as an umbrella framework working with existing Quality Assurance Schemes (QAS) making it different to other international programs. T-QUAL Accreditation endorses existing QAS who meet the T-QUAL criteria, the QAS then accredit individual operators. Individual operators cannot become T-QUAL Accredited directly, but are eligible to use the T-QUAL Tick through their accreditation with a T-QUAL endorsed QAS. Most international schemes accredit operators directly.

         (29) Aviation activity in Australia is increasing.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The most recently available figures from the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics demonstrate that domestic aviation capacity also continues to increase. There were 54.98 million passengers carried on Australian domestic airlines in 2011-12 – a record high. The number of available seats rose by 0.7 per cent to 71.08 million.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In relation to international aviation the most recently available data from the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics shows that in 2011-12, 56 airlines operated international scheduled flights to and from Australia. The number of airline seats available to travel to and from Australia increased by 3.6 per cent to a record high of 38.265 million seats. The number of international passengers travelling to and from Australia has increased from 16 million in 2002-03 to 29 million in 2011-12.

         Regarding the National Visitor Survey (NVS) methodology, the NVS has been conducted in its current form since 1998 and collects information on the domestic overnight, domestic day and outbound travel of Australians aged 15 years or more. The annual sample is 120,000, increased by 50 per cent in 2005 from 80,000, with respondents interviewed in their homes by landline about their recent travel using Random Digit Dialling and a

         ) system. Australia's NVS is an international leader in the collection of domestic travel expenditure and behaviour.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         NVS travel definitions are based on those recommended by the UNWTO. As such, interviews are conducted with people who have travelled for a number of purposes including holiday, visiting friends and relatives and business. Overall, the survey contains around 70 questions covering areas such as destination(s) visited, purpose of travel, transport used, accommodation used, length of stay, activities undertaken and expenditure on trip.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The broad coverage of the NVS ensures that it currently provides a robust measure of the overall health of domestic tourism and enables the level of performance for various segments within the domestic tourism industry to be compared. As such it is providing a good picture of the health of non-mining related tourism.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To further enhance the NVS, it will be transitioned to a combination of landline and mobile phone interviewing from 2014. With the number of "mobile only" households increasing substantially in recent years, this transition will ensure that collection methods are keeping pace with technological advances and the survey continues to provide a good picture of the health of non-mining related tourism.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Notably, the new collection methodology will provide better coverage of population groups often away from home and/​or more likely to be "mobile only" (for example, frequent business travellers, fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out workers and grey nomads). As such, from 2014, it is likely that the transition will not only enhance NVS measurement of non-mining related tourism but mining related travel as well.

Emerging trends includes tourism forecasts (arrivals and departures). Productive capacity includes benchmarking the tourism industry's [economic] performance via state tourism satellite accounts, tourism business performance and the estimates of the contribution of tourism to the economy at the national and regional levels as well as monitoring investment in the Australian tourism industry.
