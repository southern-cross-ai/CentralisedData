        I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.

        I will speak briefly to the report. I was very pleased and delighted to participate in this delegation to NATO. This assembly comprised the NATO member countries and a number of invited and other participating delegates from associate countries. This delegation and this conference was a very important one, given our participation in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">

        in Afghanistan. The fact that we have between 1,300 and 1,500 combat troops in

        conducting and participating in the war on terror is a very significant thing for a country the size of Australia.

        countries, numbering some 28, gather through their parliamentary representatives to consider and discuss various aspects of NATO’s functions. We as a delegation attended NATO headquarters in Belgium. Then we went across the channel to Edinburgh. There were many people who helped the delegation. His Excellency Dr Alan Thomas, the Australian Ambassador to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community" rel="nofollow">
         European Community

        , Belgium and Luxembourg, was very forthcoming with a great deal of advice and assistance. The mission generally provided a lot of help to what I believe is a very important part of parliamentary life in Australia, particularly while we have troops fighting in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pause to say that Colonel Michael Toohey, who is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Attache" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to the European Community, Belgium and Luxembourg, assisted the delegation very greatly. He is a very fine Australian military officer. Upon getting off the aircraft in Belgium, to see an Australian uniform with a beautiful bright plume on a slouch hat was an absolute delight and a credit to the

        </a>
        and to Colonel Toohey. He assisted us on our visits to a number of very important war graves,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyne_Cot" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and many others. He gave us thorough briefings on and the backgrounds to what had happened. We were in the very famous town of Ypres in Belgium on 11 November, which is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">

        ; and Mr Richard Selth. It was a very convivial group of people. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. The experience is very well documented in the report and sets out that the conference—particularly considering that we did meet the Dutch parliamentarians, and we are partnered with the Dutch in Oruzgan province in Afghanistan—was a most useful and beneficial one to attend. I believe that Australia should participate, particularly considering that not only are we involved in Afghanistan but also from time to time participate in taskforce 151, which is an antipiracy taskforce in the Gulf and adjacent to Somalia. We should give great consideration to attending this conference, if only with observer status, into the future, given our participation in these two engagements.
