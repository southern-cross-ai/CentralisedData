            I am disappointed that I have to update the Senate in relation to the attack by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
             Daniel Andrews
            </a>
            government on the tens of thousands of fantastic men and women in Victoria who put their lives on the line every other day of the week to keep Victorians safe. Instead of working towards a new enterprise agreement that recognises the important role of the volunteer firefighters, do you know what the Daniel Andrews government now wants to do?
           </p>
           <p>
            It wants to split the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
             CFA
            </a>
            . Why? Because it wants to satisfy the disgusting demands of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Marshall" rel="nofollow">
             Peter Marshall
            </a>
            and the United Firefighters Union. What did the Daniel Andrews government also do? It actually brought in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
             Simon Crean
            </a>
            —those on the other side would know this—to try and negotiate a settlement. One might say, 'Good on them for trying.' But guess what? Simon Crean, himself, was so dismayed and so disgusted at what the Daniel Andrews government was doing that he was unable to do it. Then have a look at Victorian minister
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Merlino" rel="nofollow">
             James Merlino
            </a>
            , who is misleading—Senator McKenzie knows this well—those in Victoria in relation to why they are not finalising the enterprise agreement. Ironically, this week is volunteer recognition week. I can tell you, there is nothing that the Daniel Andrews government is doing to recognise in any way the fantastic work that the tens of thousands of men, women and, in some cases, children do to stand up and protect Victorians.

              <p>
               Yes, I can. Senators will be aware that the very first act of the Turnbull government after being re-elected to govern was to move decisively to protect the tens of thousands of men and women in Victoria, the fantastic members of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
                CFA
               </a>
               . I again extend my thanks to those on the crossbench who joined us in standing up for those fantastic people. What did we do? It was very simple. All we did was ensure that enterprise agreements could not contain objectionable emergency management terms. All that does is prevent emergency services bodies from being able to support their volunteer operations. On this side of the chamber, we will never shy away from standing up for the good men and women of Australia, the people who really do make this country. We are proud to do what we did to ensure that the CFA in Victoria can continue.
