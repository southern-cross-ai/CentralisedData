        GALLAGHER (—) (): by leave—In relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 3) Bill 2022, I move government amendments (1) and (2) on sheet
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        193 together:

       <p class="italic">
        (1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 5), omit the table item.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Schedule 5, page 14 (line 1) to page 19 (line 14), to be opposed.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I foreshadowed in my speech summing up the second reading debate, this amendment removes schedule 5 from the bill pending further discussions with senators about how to proceed with that amendment. I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government's amendments to be moved in relation to these bills.

          My understanding is that it is, but the government was unaware that you were moving that amendment, and certainly I was unaware that you were moving that amendment. We had ours amended ahead of that.

           For the record, the opposition's amendment was circulated last week, so it was well aware to the chamber. Why has it been necessary to change the government's position from it's position in the House of Representatives, where it voted against the opposition's amendment which is now your amendment, to its position in the Senate this morning?

                    In my second reading speech I referred to the Your Future, Your Super review. I expect those consultations will be finalised shortly with a report to the minister some time early next year—in the first quarter of next year.

                        No, not at all. I think you have seen from this government the approach we are taking as a government, which is to talk and consult and respond accordingly. That's what you have seen with this amendment. It wasn't going to be supported by the Senate. That was clear. If there is another way we can address the concerns the opposition have in respect of this part of the bill along with concerns that the crossbench have had with that part of the bill, and if there is way we can bring people together to reach agreement on that, I think that would be a good thing.

                          The government is always mindful and watches Senate committee inquiries and reports, so I have no doubt that that fed into some of the minister's considerations as he was resolving this issue. It's a source of information; it's not the only source. Further discussions were had and the government has taken the decision to amend the bill in light of those discussions.

                            Well, I don't think that's necessarily an unusual way of doing things. Quite often we develop legislation, and then that legislation is amended after further discussions with MPs and senators. So, in that respect, this is a very unsurprising amendment. It happens regularly. It happened when you were in government. It will continue to happen, particularly when you are in a minority chamber where the government can't act alone. We have to work across the chamber. We try to work collegiately as much as we can in this place. This is just another example of that.

                             I rise to foreshadow that I will be voting for the amendments moved by the government and the coalition. Australians all deserve to be in a high-performing superannuation product. If they're not, they at least deserve to know that they're not. They should be armed with as much information as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I support the coalition amendments to put back into place the annual member meeting notices and to move them into primary legislation. I think this is an important step as the current regulations, as I have said previously, are not ideal. In amending the regulations, the parliaments had limited time to provide scrutiny before they came into effect ahead of the reporting season. So effectively most of the super funds have reported and have not had to disclose at that level of transparency. When it comes to faith based super, I have real concerns about those sorts of carve-outs and believe that they should be addressed alongside

                             or more ethical focused funds as part of the broader review—and I'm pleased to see the government has introduced an amendment. As we know, the coalition's would have got up on the numbers.

                            <p>
                             I really think more transparency is crucial when it comes to superannuation. Members deserve to know how much they're paying in fees and how their super company is paying directors and making donations to various bodies, and I will support any measure to increase that transparency.

                                 In recent times, there's been a lot of discussion about the transparency regime for super funds. Senator Pocock has been an active participant in those discussions, and of course that's a good thing. We've got a situation where regulations were introduced by the government post this year's election, and those regulations currently have had two disallowances moved against them—one by me on behalf of the Australian Greens, and one by Senator Lambie. It is strongly the view of the Australian Greens that that is the appropriate forum for discussion and decision, rather than the way forward proposed by these amendments, which is effectively to legislate rather than to regulate.
