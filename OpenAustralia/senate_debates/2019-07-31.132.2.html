        I'd like this afternoon to reflect on the great contribution of two very good
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        Liberals who, unfortunately, have passed away in recent months. I single out Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Oliver" rel="nofollow">
         Neil Oliver
        </a>
        and Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lewis" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Lewis
        </a>
        AM for their distinguished careers as active members of our community in Western Australia, as active members of the Western Australian Liberal party and, importantly, as significant and important parliamentarians who made a great contribution to the growth and prosperity of Western Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to begin by sharing with the Senate comments that Anthony
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAdam" rel="nofollow">
         McAdam
        </a>
        made—Anthony McAdam being a lifelong friend of Mr Neil Oliver—and which were reported in
        <i>
         The
        </i>
        <i>
         West Australian
        </i>
        on 22 July this year. I'd like to talk about Neil Oliver's contribution, reflecting on those remarks by Mr McAdam, in three parts: the early life of Neil Oliver, the parliamentary and political life of Neil Oliver and Neil Oliver as more than just a parliamentarian but a man committed to his community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anthony McAdam starts:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have just lost a proud and valued citizen of WA, and Australia generally, known to all simply as Neil Oliver, former army officer, respected member of the WA Parliament and, not least, a stalwart defender of the public interest, notably during the whole

       <p>
        But Neil Oliver's parliamentary and political life is the lens through which I got to know Neil Oliver. Anthony McAdam writes:

        During this period Oliver was often in the news, not least when it was revealed that his phone had been tapped. It was a lonely fight. The full story of that dramatic parliamentary enquiry and its consequences is chronicled in the 1987 book Burke's Shambles: Parliamentary Contempt in the

        The second Western Australian parliamentarian that I want to honour this afternoon is none other than Mr Richard Lewis AM, a distinguished member of the Western Australian parliament, a distinguished member of the Court government and a man whose legacy you can see around you when you travel across Perth and its various metropolitan communities. I'd like to share some comments, again reported in
        <i>

        Beginning with 'Richard Lewis AM, cabinet minister and surveyor, born in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Fremantle" rel="nofollow">
         East Fremantle

        in 1939, died in Perth aged 79', it continues:

         Perth Technical College

        checking calculations and measurements. Cadet cartographers/surveyors like Richard Lewis needed stamina and patience throughout a work day.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While still in his teens he embraced the world of maps, statistics, numbers, angles and distances. He could have stayed on this reasonably straightforward path, but realised that life offered more.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Within months of obtaining his certificate of competency in 1969 he stood as council candidate in Melville, entering the less measurable environment of suburban democracy. Over the next 14 years he was to serve three terms as deputy mayor, proving himself in the sometimes difficult, always changeable, field of local affairs. This proved to be the launchpad for the next level of government. In 1986 he was elected Liberal

        Richard Lewis's contribution to public life is outstanding. I came to know Richard Lewis as a minister in the Court government when I had the privilege of working with

         Premier of Western Australia

        . Richard Lewis's legacies to Western Australia are many. He will be fondly remembered by all of those people who got to know him in his local community, who came to work with him as a minister in the Court government, who came to know him through his active involvement and regular attendance at The 500 Club events in Western Australia, and who came to know him as a generous man, a family man, a man who was committed to many things, not least his great faith in the

       </p>
       <p>
        I might end with this particular story from the same article in
        <i>
         The West Australian
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many attest to Richard's capacity to countenance views different from his. He went so far as to accept free kicks being given against his beloved West Coast Eagles, including while attending all their four victorious grand finals. Surveying profession colleagues enjoyed his company at social functions for decades.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Richard Lewis died on March 3. He is survived by Helen, their daughter Morgen, son Lachlan and three grandchildren and his three brothers, Don, Roger and Lyndon.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That crew 60 years ago clearly had the right man in the right seat.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm delighted to be able to share some comments with the Senate this afternoon about another outstanding Western Australian Liberal—another outstanding Western Australian state Liberal parliamentarian. I'm sure many of my Senate colleagues who know Richard and who know his family will extend to them their deepest sympathies on the loss of an outstanding Western Australian.
