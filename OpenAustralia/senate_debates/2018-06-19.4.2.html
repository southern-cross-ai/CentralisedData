        Last night, we were finishing up the issue of 'funder of last resort'. Can the minister provide any further information around the issue of defunct organisations, where the government isn't equally responsible? Has there been any further clarification overnight of how the 93 per cent figure was arrived at? Is there any confirmation of whether those survivors that were in one of those defunct institutions will or won't be covered?

         I'm advised that the figure that's been used by the minister is a derived figure. I refer you to a document entitled
         <i>
          Final information update: during our five-year inquiry
         </i>
         . I'm not sure, Senator Siewert, if you have that document. In that document, there's a chart headed 'Proportion of survivors who told us they were abused in a religious institution'. When you look at that chart, you can see a breakdown, and I am advised that that chart assisted the minister and informed him in relation to that figure.

          Not all survivors were abused in religious institutions and, in fact, I think it's likely that some of the survivors in defunct institutions will actually be in non-religious institutions. That's why I want to pursue this a bit further, to find out for those beyond non-religious institutions. I tried to ask this last night: are those survivors that were in defunct institutions, where the government doesn't have responsibility, not going to have access to redress?

           Senator Siewert, it goes to the point that I was making yesterday evening. Until someone makes an application—let me just assume for a moment they say 'organisation X', and we don't know if organisation X is genuinely defunct. It's possible that organisation X may have transferred some of its property. It may be that there is a corporate structure associated with institution X that requires delving into with an examination. That was the point that I was making yesterday evening, Senator Siewert. I know the point that you're trying to make and I'm trying to assist you, but unless somebody comes out and says, 'This is my claim against this particular—'

             Senator Pratt, I'll take that interjection. You have to have an application by somebody to be able to ascertain the legal framework of that particular organisation. It's a pretty simple concept.

              I do understand what the minister is saying in terms of an application. I'm trying to get to the principle here, which is what Senator Pratt was just referring to. Under these provisions—because of the way the national bill has been reworded and because there's no participating government that is equally responsible if people were abused in an organisation that is defunct—there is a bottom line which means that there are potentially survivors who will not be able to access redress because there is no ultimate funder of last resort. That's what I'm trying to articulate, and to find out from government if that is a correct understanding, whether or not someone's applied. Surely, in drafting this bill, you had that concept in mind. What happens when there is a defunct organisation, so there are no corporate responsibilities? It has disappeared. And I admit that it is probably more likely to be non-religious institutions—there could be some religious institutions—where there is no equally responsible participating government. Is that a fact or not? It seems to me that this must have come up in your negotiations with the states and when you were considering this legislation.

               Senator Siewert, perhaps I can assist you in this way. I'm advised that the funder-of-last-resort policy must necessarily have some limitations; otherwise, it may act as a disincentive for financially viable institutions to opt in to the scheme. Importantly, the scheme's legislation facilitates non-government institutions, where they operate as an umbrella organisation, taking responsibility for defunct institutions that fall under that umbrella. In many cases it is more appropriate for these institutions to take responsibility for their defunct institutions than it would be for governments to step in as a funder of last resort. The policy is also intended to prevent non-government institutions from potentially exaggerating the state of their finances in order to have government step in. The policy provides governments with some degree of certainty as to the funder-of-last-resort liability.

                So basically it is the case that government does not want to be the ultimate funder of last resort, for those reasons. But, as I understand it and as survivors understand it—because survivors have been raising this with us—it is the case that people from a defunct organisation, where there is no longer an organisation, will not be able to access redress, because the government is scared of those messages and has not the wit to find other ways to put in this legislation to stop that happening and to make sure those people who were abused in defunct organisations do actually receive redress. That is the fact, isn't it?

                 Senator Siewert, I've just advised you what I am instructed is the position. Yesterday evening I also canvassed the situations of governments being funders of last resort. I'm happy to repeat what I said yesterday evening: that funder-of-last-resort arrangements will apply where a government has equal responsibility with a defunct non-government institution for the abuse of a child. The relevant government will therefore pay the non-government institution's share of redress. If a survivor is abused in an institution that exists but has simply chosen not to participate in the scheme, governments will not be a funder of last resort. This approach is necessary to ensure that non-government institutions, where they have the capacity to participate in the scheme, are not disincentivised from doing so. I think my two statements provide you with the appropriate ambit to answer the question that you asked.

                  They do actually answer my question, and that answer is: there are some people who don't have access to redress because they were in defunct organisations. I wasn't asking about where organisations refused to opt in. We did discuss opt-in institutions yesterday, but the fact is some survivors will not be able to access redress because the government isn't prepared to act as the funder of last resort where there are defunct organisations.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I want to move on to issues related to people in jail, unable to apply for redress. The provisions are subject to the discretion of the operator. The operator may determine that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the application being made. Can you outline what are classed as exceptional circumstances?

                     Senator Siewert, I was seeking to clarify what you'd said before—so thank you, Senator Pratt! Senator Siewert, could you kindly just repeat what you asked? I'm trying to answer and address your question. Puerile interjections from Senator Pratt are not going to assist the situation at this point.

                      Yes. To be fair, I did end my comments on last-resort funding before I asked my question. I will acknowledge that. My question was about the rules around exceptional circumstances for those in jail. The position in the legislation is that people in jail are unable to apply for redress but the operator has the ability to determine, in exceptional circumstances, if they can. I'm asking: what are those exceptional circumstances for people in jail to be able to apply?

                              In terms of that process, there were arguments put forward that those in jail would be unable to get the direct personal response or the counselling and support services while they're in jail. Do those arguments still hold, or is it being considered that some people in jail would be able to get those parts of the whole redress scheme?

                                  I am going to try to do this as quickly as possible, but these are the sorts of things that we want to understand about the way the scheme is going to operate. So it'll be in the intergovernmental agreement. Each state will then have prescribed a process under which this will happen if somebody applies and is, in fact, found eligible. That will all be agreed up-front, and will people be able to see those intergovernmental agreements?

                                      Thank you. That does answer my question. It's a work in progress. While we are talking about questions on notice, you took on notice quite a few yesterday. Are we able to agree, in the chamber, to a date when we will get those answers back? I'm not accusing you of sending it off to the never-never, but I just want to ensure that doesn't happen.

                                          A positive thank you? Yes, I'm very sincere when I say 'thank you'. I do have some more questions. Could I move on to applications that can't be made in the final 12 months of the scheme? I note that this provision is, again, subject to the discretion of the operator, and that the operator may determine that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the application being made. Could you outline what would constitute these exceptional circumstances, because, in effect, this takes it to being a nine-year scheme rather than a 10-year scheme, other than under exceptional circumstances?

But I would go back to the comment that I made yesterday evening that the bill does include two reviews and an annual report to parliament on the scheme.

                                            I'm not sure how that relates to the question I just asked you in terms of, in the last 12 months people can't apply.

                                            then take from your answer that that might change under the reviews? Sorry if I'm missing something here.

                                                I want to go back to the question that I was addressing a bit earlier that you took on notice. I had talked about those in jail and those who have a serious conviction. For those with a serious conviction, the process is more articulated in the legislation. Where are the provisions articulated regarding those in jail, to make it the same? We don't take that from the reading of the legislation, sorry.

Doesn't that mean that the issues around those in jail are more subject to disallowable instruments and change in the rules?

                                                    I'm still struggling, sorry, with your answer, going back to the 12 months of the scheme. I'm still struggling with how that's going to be addressed in the reviews. It's a fairly simple fact that the legislation says that it's only under exceptional circumstances, that somebody seeking redress in that last year can only do it through exceptional circumstances. I'm struggling with the answer to: 'What are the exceptional circumstances?' and the answer on the review, because it's the exceptional circumstances that I'm after there. I do appreciate the fact that you've suggested there may be a change to people being able to seek redress in that last year.

Again, it goes back to the point that I made earlier about the importance of when an application is made and, then, examining the circumstances of that particular application.

                                                       I think your question goes to the interaction of the reviews and also, basically, that last year of the legislation. The point I'm seeking to make is that it may be that, in some cases, those exceptional circumstances will not arise or will not come to the fore for a period of time; therefore, it goes to the point I was making before. As the scheme progresses, it's likely that we will see the numbers as they come through and, at least, have an assessment of what those numbers are and, if I can put it—numbers, review, people becoming more aware. They all lead to a point where, it's our hope, all those people who need to be covered will be covered. Do you see where I'm going, Senator?

                                                        It's good to understand the thinking and the process there; thank you, Minister. I have a question or two around direct personal response. Under the previous Commonwealth bill, a note to clause 50(1) provided for a consequence if a participating institution did not comply with the request of a survivor for a direct personal response—that is, the operator had to include details about the noncompliance in the annual report on the scheme, required under clause 122, which would be presented to the parliament by the minister. This hasn't been included in the national bill. Will it now be included in the rules?

                                                          It's not in this bill. The easiest way is for me to ask is: what has happened to the provision in the previous bill where, if a participating institution didn't comply with a request for a direct personal response, there was a requirement for it to be in the annual report? It's not there now, so I can't point to it in the current bill. I'm asking: how will that now be accommodated?

I'm going to try them and see how we go. You may need to take them on notice. Under the national bill, if an applicant does not provide additional information requested by the operator within the designated period, the operator is not required to give a determination until the information is provided. Why can the operator not progress the application in the same way they can if an institution does not provide the information requested within the designated period?

Senator Siewert, I'm advised that the legislation provides the parameters in relation to compelling the institutions, but it can't compel survivors. You need the survivors to provide information, or otherwise, for their application to be progressed.

I can understand now what you're saying in terms of a survivor—that you don't want to have that same compulsion. I've already had survivors talk to me about filling in the form and being traumatised, and then having to take a break and maybe not engage for a while. There are potentially some issues where an application could be progressed without that information. So I'm wondering: is there going to be a process where an application could progress to a certain point without that information, and then stop until that information is gained?

I've got another question now which is similar to the other question that I asked around the direct personal response and noncompliant institutions. Under clause 122 of the Commonwealth bill, the operator has to include details about the noncompliance of institutions in providing information—not just direct personal response but in general—in the annual report on the scheme, which would be presented to the parliament by the minister. This is another area that wasn't included in the national bill. Is that going to be included in an instrument or the rules?

We've had some discussion about this, and a number of us mentioned it in our second reading contributions. What are the mechanisms that are in place to ensure that an applicant doesn't receive a really insulting low payment? Is it possible that applicants, for example, could be offered just a couple of hundred bucks? Does the government acknowledge that receiving this kind of offer could in fact be retraumatising to people and the fact that there is no minimum payment could very well retraumatise people?

Why was there no minimum payment set so that we wouldn't be in the position that we're in right now, where you can't guarantee that some survivors will not get what people have said to me would be an insultingly low payment that would potentially retraumatise people? The question is: why was there no minimum payment?

                                                                                           I think this is probably an appropriate time to remind the chamber of some of the details. I know that senators have raised some points on the detail of this Redress Scheme. I think I need to not only address this point but make it really, really clearly. We have responded many times publicly, but I do want to make clear the position on this point. The royal commission made recommendations to government on elements of the scheme including redress amounts, funder of last resort and counselling. However, the key principle underpinning the royal commission's recommendations was the provision of nationally consistent redress to survivors and that the Commonwealth government had the constitutional power to compel states, territories and non-government institutions to opt into the scheme. This understanding is wrong.
                                                                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">

                                                                                           </a>
                                                                                           has no power to compel the states and territories or non-government institutions to join any national redress scheme.
                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                           So, as a consequence of that, the Commonwealth has had to negotiate all the elements of the scheme, including redress amounts, counselling and implementation. Without such negotiation, there would be no national redress scheme, and survivors would not have the redress which they have waited so long to receive. I think it's really important, because a number of the comments that have been made in this chamber have been premised on the point that basically the Commonwealth has the power to compel.
                                                                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">

As a result, we, the Commonwealth, have had to negotiate all the elements of the scheme—all the elements of the scheme—including a lot of the detail that you've asked me about. Without such negotiation, we wouldn't have had this National Redress Scheme. It's really important that all senators understand that the Commonwealth does not have the power to compel the states and territories and the non-government institutions.

Did the Commonwealth talk to the states about a minimum payment for the very reasons that I have just articulated, where a scheme that is supposed to be helping people—and will help people, I should say—will actually end up retraumatising some people because the Commonwealth, the states and the territories and the non-government institutions did not agree on a minimum payment? That's my first question. The next question is: have you talked to the states about how you will address this issue of no minimum payment and what it means to survivors and applicants who get what they describe as an insultingly low payment?

I indicate that I am genuinely trying to get through these. It would help if I didn't get everything taken on notice. People actually want to hear answers to these questions. I want to ask about the one application rule. If an eligible applicant submits an application involving sexual abuse at two institutions and only one institution is participating, will the applicant be able to access a payment that represents appropriate redress for the abuse at the participating institution and have their application held on file until such a time as another responsible institution opts into the scheme?

This scheme only applies to survivors who were sexually abused, although my understanding under the assessment framework is that, if you were sexually abused, other forms of abuse will be taken into account, such as physical abuse.

It didn't necessarily rule out those survivors who did not suffer sexual abuse but suffered other forms of abuse. This is a question for you, Minister. Is the government considering, or prepared to consider, how to provide support and redress to those survivors of non-sexual physical or mental abuse in another way? I'm not asking about under this scheme. I already know the answer to that. I'm asking if you are prepared to consider or are considering some forms of redress for those survivors.

It will not be applied for money paid for medical costs or for any money that was not specifically a compensation payment, and anything beyond that is a decision for government.

Do you mean a decision of government about whether that would be included in the review? In other words, there's deep concern, which we've canvassed in the debate, around people ending up—it goes back to the minimum payment question—with quite small payments. There's a lot of concern in the community about this. So what I was asking about goes to that fact. Will it be considered in the review? Is your answer, basically, that the government will decide that?

I've got one final set of questions around application assistance. We know it's going to be a quite lengthy process. We also know that some people have indicated it could be a retraumatising process. If an applicant wants a psychological assessment done as part of their application, for example, would the scheme fund that? What funding is available for that sort of assistance?

I have a couple of other questions for you to take on notice, please. Will there be qualifications and experience requirements for those organisations or people that are providing that form of assistance? Will trauma informed practice be a requirement for agencies providing that assistance? We talked yesterday about existing relationships with therapeutic practices. Will they be able to access those existing relationships for a form of application assistance—does that make sense?
