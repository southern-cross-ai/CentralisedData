        —that's what we've witnessed here in this chamber this week.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        , the Liberals and the Nationals are all doing their dirty deeds right in front of our eyes. We have a homelessness crisis in this country and a rental squeeze. We desperately need more social and affordable housing, yet all of those opposite and around this chamber—like the Greens, who've thrown the baby out with the bathwater—are stamping their feet because they're not getting what they want. They would prefer to see people stay homeless than to give their support to the bill that's going to make a difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government wants to deliver security and put more roofs over the heads of desperate Australians who need a place to call home. The Greens, the Liberals and the Nationals are now all known as the 'no-alition' because, instead of looking at this legislation as another layer of support on top of everything else that we've done in our recent budget, they're prepared to say no. This is a new all-time low in Australian politics. This is senseless, destructive politics. Those opposite only say no in this place. What they really need to do is accept the election result. They're in opposition. The Australian people have spoken: they want action, they don't want people being left behind and they're sick of the Greens coming into this place and trying to write what they want into legislation instead of accepting that this is a $10 billion housing affordability investment in the future of all Australians. But, no, the Greens won't support that; they'd rather do their dirty deal with the Liberals, which is extraordinary, considering that the Liberals in Tasmania are always criticising Labor for doing deals with the Greens. What we've seen is this 'no-alition', which is growing, with all of them involved.
