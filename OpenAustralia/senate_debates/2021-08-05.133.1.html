A report from Spanish media overnight quoted Spain's UNESCO ambassador as admitting to striking a deal with Australia, that they would support Australia's amendments to have the reef not listed as in danger if Australia backed its attempt to have two Spanish properties added to the

            Senator Whish-Wilson, I appreciate the question had a very lengthy preamble. The minister was addressing the body that made the decision you are questioning about, so I believe the minister is directly relevant if she's talking about the decision made, because she's entitled to be directly relevant to all or part of a question, especially when it lengthy.

             Discussions between the members of the committee will always remain private, so we make no apologies for defending Australia's reputation as the best marine park managers in the world. The minister for the environment has highlighted before that climate change is the most serious long-term threat to the health of coral reefs worldwide, and that includes the Great
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
              Barrier Reef
             </a>
             . It also threatens 82 other World Heritage sites around the world. Rainforests, fjord-lands, glaciers—none would be better off if
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">
              UNESCO
             </a>
             succeeded in its bid to single out Australia for what is, we all agree, a global problem. That's why the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Committee" rel="nofollow">
              World Heritage Committee
             </a>
             unanimously struck out this year's attempt to use Australia only for its global call to action.
            </p>
            <p>
             With only 1.3 per cent of global emissions, Australia cannot fix this problem alone. The world must do more to reduce emissions and the World Heritage Committee must find a path towards collective action and not singular punishment. The Morrison government's concern was that UNESCO sought an immediate in-danger listing without appropriate consultation, without a site visit and without all the latest information. It's clear that this process concerned not only Australia but other nations as well. So we welcome the support of an overwhelming majority of the nations at the 44th session of the World Heritage Committee.

               didn't strike this out; it recommitted the vote to May 2022. Your government is now being watched closely by the world. There is specific language in the recent UNESCO ruling that requires Australia to demonstrate an acceleration on key points of the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan, including by lowering emissions that are killing the reef, beyond current plans. What is your plan for accelerating emissions reduction, and how is giving money to new fossil fuel projects, including the gas-led recovery, going to accelerate emissions reductions?

We're working with the Queensland government to ensure that the strategies under the reef 2050 plan are delivering the best possible outcomes for the reef. The Australian and Queensland governments are investing more than $3 billion from 2014-15 to 2023-24 to implement the reef 2050 plan. More than $2 billion of this is from the Australian government.

                    Order. The wearing of masks makes it difficult to call senators to order because I can't see their mouths move, particularly at the rear of the chamber. I can recognise some voices at the front of the chamber.
