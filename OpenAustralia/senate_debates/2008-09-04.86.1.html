         I thank Senator Cash for her question. I do not accept the proposition that the senator has advanced today. The simple facts of life are that the Rudd Labor government has been working in partnership with the Carpenter government to deliver an education revolution for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         government to deliver world-class school facilities for 350,000 students studying in both government and non-government schools. The Rudd Labor government has committed $284 million over the next decade to build state-of-the-art trade training centres to service Western Australia’s 335 secondary schools. Fifteen Western Australian schools are amongst the 96 schools nationally who have successfully obtained trade training centre funding in the first round of the program.

            Talking about trade training schools is all very interesting, but completely and utterly irrelevant to the issue of primary schools, and that is what the minister was asked about. If you were,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            , to take up Senator Conroy’s interjection that it is about education, we could have the ridiculous situation of a specific question on primary schools being asked and the minister being allowed to answer in relation to universities. Clearly there must be some relevance to the answer, and I would invite you to direct the minister’s attention to the question.

              Mr President
             </a>
             : Senator Abetz again in question time uses the point of order to express a view about the minister answering the question. The minister is answering the question; the minister is relevant to the question. What Senator Abetz then chooses to do is to go on a wide-ranging discourse over issues that he wants to canvass and use the point of order to do that. I think it is impermissible for Senator Abetz to use the point of order in that way, although it has been used, obviously, by him in this way this week. But in this instance I would humbly submit there is no point of order.

              You should not be debating it, Senator Ludwig. I remind all those who take points of order that they are entitled to take a point of order but not to debate the issue at large. That applies to you, Senator Abetz, as much as it applies to Senator Ludwig and others in this chamber. In response to the point of order that Senator Abetz has raised, I would draw the minister’s attention to the question and ask him to address the question now in the two minutes and 41 seconds left.

               I was asked a question that went to the issue of educational standards in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                Western Australia
               </a>
               . I was asked a question about the success, as I read it, of the Rudd Labor government in working with the Carpenter government to deliver an education revolution for the people of Western Australia. It is disappointing that Senator Abetz has so little understanding of these issues that he finds he has to raise these spurious points of order. If the senators would be interested to know what the government’s position is on national testing, I am only too happy to provide them with further advice.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you want to talk about the fundamentals—the fundamentals of ensuring equality of opportunity for all children and the fundamentals of ensuring proper participation in our society—then you must talk about a broader set of issues than just the question of benchmark testing. You must also talk about the opportunities for the breadth of the curriculum which this government is providing. This government is providing these services to the people of Western Australia in partnership with the Labor government of Western Australia. As a consequence, the opportunities that are being developed for children in Western Australia are far superior to anything that was offered through the 12 years of the previous government—a government whose record and whose legacy was one of neglect. And it was a clear case that the Liberal government chose to avoid its responsibilities to ensure that every child in this country had the opportunity to participate fully.

                 election through the Senate. The Australian government is working in partnership with the Western Australian Labor government to deliver world-class school facilities and world-class opportunities for the 350,000 children of Western Australia studying in both government and non-government schools. These are Labor governments—the government here in Canberra and the government in Perth—dedicated to an education revolution, to ensuring that every student has a world-class education. Of course, that is the basis on which we operate. It is a pity that those opposite are so ignorant.
