        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture. On Tuesday night this week, Channel 9 ran yet another story about

          Gee, it's coming in thick and fast here today! This doesn't specifically relate to livestock per se, but, as you know, the contamination of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Defence Force
          </a>
          sites with respect to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
           PFAS
          </a>
          has been an issue that the Senate committees and this chamber have investigated over a long period of time. Across the world, PFAS is used widely in a range of different industries and contamination by PFAS is a global issue. We're aware of it, and we're acting on community concerns regarding the exposure to PFAS. Our priority is to support affected communities and to reduce their exposure to PFAS.
         </p>
         <p>
          My advice is that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Defence
          </a>
          is working closely with the PFAS Taskforce in the Department of the Environment and Energy, which has the whole-of-government lead in responding to this issue. Angus Taylor's area and Minister Ley's area have the whole-of-government lead. Government action and investment to date has been extensive, including measures to support local communities affected by PFAS contamination. Our government has committed substantial resources to the investigation, remediation and monitoring of sites and will continue to invest as required. Each site is different, so there's no one-size-fits-all solution, and, while the full cost of PFAS investigation, remediation and monitoring measures is not known, it will be significant. Defence will hold four community information sessions during December 2019 to present the findings of our detailed—

             I said no such thing. I actually outlined a whole-of-government approach to dealing with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
              PFAS
             </a>
             contamination issue on Defence sites. As I was just getting to in my previous answer, there will be four community information sessions during December to present the findings of the detailed site investigations, the human health risk assessment reports and the interim ecological risk assessment reports at the various four sites. Based on the knowledge and evidence available at this time, our government is not considering a land purchase program as a result of the PFAS contamination issue.

            <p>
             With respect to the health impacts of PFAS, my advice is that questions relating to health advice or guidance should be directed to the

              Department of Health
             </a>
             , and our government works with Commonwealth, state and territory health authorities to ensure that human health advice and guidance on PFAS—
