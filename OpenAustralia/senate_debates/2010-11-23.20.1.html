            I thank Senator Polley for her question and note her ongoing interest in the Tasmanian forest industry. The Gillard government understands the financial hardship facing forestry contractors in the Tasmanian haulage and harvest sectors. We are committed to building a viable forest contracting sector that can support communities and work throughout Tasmania. That is why we have committed $22.4 million today to support the industry, and what the government announced represents a balanced response to a very difficult problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are three elements to the $22.4 million package that I announced with Minister Green from Tasmania today. They are: assistance of up to $750,000 each to help contractors exit the business with dignity; for viable businesses, a pool of $5.4 million in business assistance, which will be delivered by the state government; and fairer contracts to support a viable, ongoing industry. Each of these elements is focused squarely on delivering a leaner, stronger, more viable contracting sector in Tasmania for the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whoever I consulted on this issue—whether from industry, the contractors association, the state government, the community or the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
             CFMEU
            </a>
            —there was widespread agreement that there was an oversupply of contracting services in the native forest sector in Tasmania, and that this was seriously threatening the viability of the industry. The exit grants contained within the package are in direct response to this stakeholder feedback.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government recognises that exiting is only part of the answer to this problem. That is why we are delivering two other crucial elements within the package to deliver better viability for the industry in the future. These are—

             <p>
              I thank Senator Polley for her supplementary question. This announcement today delivers on the government’s election commitment to provide much-needed assistance for Tasmanian forestry contractors. The commitment and cooperation between all parties in these discussions has been positive and productive, and the government has appreciated the work and patience of all involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              This package will allocate $17 million towards exit assistance for eligible haulage or harvest forestry contracting businesses to support their transition out of the industry. The exit assistance can be applied for immediately, with applications closing in the middle of December, and I expect offers to be made to successful applicants before Christmas. The application assessment process will be completed by officials from the Australian and Tasmanian governments, who will also be able to draw on external expertise to assist in the assessment process. Up to $750,000 will be available for each successful eligible business that is predominantly in the native forest sector.

                I thank Senator Polley for her second supplementary question. The government is pleased to be delivering today a balanced set of measures to support viability in the contracting industry. From those opposite there has been a constant tide of negative talk about the forestry industry in Tasmania.

                 The Liberals

                have played cheap politics and have not given consideration to the workers, their families and their communities. The government acted quickly and worked diligently with all interested parties to develop and implement a series of measures that will assist the development of a viable contracting sector. This has not been helped by the willingness of those opposite to add to the legitimate fears of communities that could potentially be in crisis. This package is good news for forestry contractors, workers and their communities. It is a good package of measures that directly—
