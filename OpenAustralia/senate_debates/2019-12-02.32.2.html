        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. I refer to Prime Minister Morrison's call to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        police commissioner about the criminal investigation into the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. A spokesman for Attorney-General
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Porter" rel="nofollow">
         Christian Porter
        </a>
        has confirmed that he was in the room during the call. Why did it take five days to make that fact public, and why did Prime Minister Morrison fail to advise the House that the Attorney-General was present for the phone call when he made a statement to the House five days earlier?

         The questions that get answered are the questions that are asked. I might just throw back: why did Labor not volunteer that it was a partisan, politically motivated letter from the shadow Attorney-General that was the single thing that initiated this whole process? Why did Labor not fess up immediately that this was nothing more than a partisan, politically motivated witch-hunt by the shadow Attorney-General, many of which he has pursued in the past, all of them unsuccessful? He is indeed a serial letter writer, a serial pest and usually unsuccessful.

The question is whether or not the Prime Minister sought any advice from the Attorney-General about the appropriateness of the call. I hope the minister, given he has dodged the first two questions, might actually answer this one.

                        Senator Wong, I'll take the interjection then, but, quite frankly, the previous question, which you did raise a point of order to, referred to 'why', and I think the minister was in order in using those words in answering why the government did not do something. I don't think I can rule that is not directly relevant. There is a time to debate this after question time, and that's the appropriate forum for it.

The truth is, and the reason the Prime Minister was forced to act the way he did was, because the shadow Attorney-General was the one who initiated a process in a partisan politically motivated way and, of course, being asked about it by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives—

                              On the point of order, my apologies, I was receiving advice from senators about the order of questions during that sentence, which I occasionally do during question time. I ruled previously the minister was entitled when asked a question which started with 'why'—that's a very wide-ranging question. On this particular matter, I don't consider the opposition's policies to be directly relevant, but, as I said, I'm not going to pull up a minister in the middle of a glancing sentence. There are nine seconds remaining to answer, and I call the minister to continue.

                               . The only reason why the Prime Minister was forced to make these inquiries was because the Leader of the Opposition asked a question in the House of Representatives without revealing the fact that it had been initiated—
