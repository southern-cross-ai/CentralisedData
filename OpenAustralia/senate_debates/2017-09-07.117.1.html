        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Senator Birmingham.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US" rel="nofollow">
         The US
        </a>
        has just seen the most costly natural disaster in their history with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Harvey" rel="nofollow">
         Hurricane Harvey
        </a>
        causing an estimated $180 billion in damage. Harvey broke a number of US climate records, including for a single rainfall event. Another hurricane, Irma—one of the most powerful storms ever recorded—is now tracking towards Florida. It's worth noting that Irma's destructive wind speeds are beyond the theoretical maximum provided by models for the Atlantic. In other words, meteorologists are saying that they had never expected or predicted a storm like Irma. Is the minister aware that climate scientists are highlighting that unpredicted, exceedingly high ocean temperatures have triggered both these historical superstorms?

         I note, Senator Whish-Wilson's very lengthy question that concluded by asking me if I am aware of what unnamed climate scientists may have said in relation to certain storms that—perhaps rather than having a long preamble, he could have directly cited any such climate scientists and made sure that there was a direct reference to what it is that he is alluding to. No, I'm not aware of the particular unnamed scientists that you're referring to. The minister may well be; his department may well be. I'm happy to take that on notice.

           now dead from back-to-back coral bleaching and tropical storms also caused by warmer-than-forecast ocean temperatures—I hope the minister has had his brief on this one—does the government accept that rising ocean temperatures are already an existential global risk right now and will only worsen without vastly accelerated climate action?

            . Australia is making, as it has always done, major contributions in relation to emissions reductions worldwide. We have set targets—targets that are amongst the highest in the world on a per-capita basis in terms of emissions reduction targets for the future. And we will, as we have always, meet those targets, meet and exceed those targets I expect, as we have always done, and as we are doing again in relation to our 2020 targets. Equally, in relation to the Great Barrier Reef, we are doing record amounts in conjunction with the Queensland government in terms of investment, focus and action to protect the Great Barrier Reef. The focus is on practical action—

               Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. You did ask: 'Does the government accept that?' It's implicit in the minister's answer of all the mitigating efforts the government has taken that it probably does accept. I can only deduce that from the answer the minister has given, so I determine he's directly relevant. Minister.
