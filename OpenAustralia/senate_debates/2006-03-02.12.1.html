             I thank Senator Patterson, amongst others, for that generosity. The visit of Prime Minister Blair is rapidly coming upon us, and I think it is very important to recognise that he is not a head of state. Indeed, he is somewhat of a fading star in global politics. However, it is important to note that we have not yet been notified about an address that is proposed by Prime Minister Blair—

               Okay. It is there on the list now. Let me put a point of view here that is somewhat different from the prime ministerial point of view, because this is a directive, if you like, from the Prime Minister. We have in this place a
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
                Great Hall
               </a>
               . It should not just be for the raising of huge amounts of money by political parties. It should be put into the service of the people of Australia generally. It is the proper place for visiting heads of state and also people who are not heads of state, like Prime Minister Blair, to address parliamentarians and, indeed, citizens of this country. That is what the Great Hall’s function is.
              </p>
              <p>
               The use of the chambers of parliament is for those elected to this parliament under our democratic system. The proposal that we go to the House of Representatives to listen to the address from Prime Minister Blair is second-rate. We ought to be going to the Great Hall of this parliament.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
                The Senate
               </a>
               should not be seen as a secondary house. We should not be simply falling into a process whereby the Prime Minister of this country wants to aggrandise himself and make determinations about how and when this parliament should be used. Of course, the members of the government will rubber-stamp this proposal, but I want to make it absolutely clear that visiting politicians, whatever their status might be, should be addressing parliamentarians and members of the public in the Great Hall. That is the proper function of the Great Hall.

                    Senator Brown, I did not actually quite hear what you said, but I do not think it was an endearing term. I would ask you to withdraw that remark. I think it may have been offensive.

                         Senator Patterson does not want to be seen as being identified so closely with or like the Prime Minister. That is okay; I can understand that. I can see why that would be offensive. The fact is that the

                           , I rise on a point of order. I mean no disrespect to Senator Bartlett, but it seems to me that we are having this debate at the wrong point. If senators followed the red they would see that this resolution relates to the sitting times in order to allow senators to attend the lunch. I think what we are having is a concern about the message which comes under item 7 on the red regarding the resolution carried by the House of Representatives regarding the invitation. I would just bring that to your attention, Mr President. It seems to me that we are going around in circles on the wrong issue.

                             I thank the Senate. Just briefly, even though this motion does relate to the lunch—and I have not decided whether I will go or not, not that anyone will particularly care—I do think that, following on from other comments, it has been the Democrat view, repeatedly stated, that the
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
                              Great Hall
                             </a>
                             is a better place for addresses by visiting foreign leaders. But I should note that the message that is going to appear from the House of Representatives does conform with recommendations and, indeed, a resolution adopted by the Senate and I think by the House of Representatives after the last occasions where we had visiting dignitaries speaking. So it has at least been an advance in that the government is listening to the recommendations and resolutions put forward regarding these sorts of addresses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             It is still something that obviously changes a bit as we go along because Mr Blair is not a head of state, of course. Indeed, I think we have a head of state in the country at the time who is not coming to address us here. But that is a separate matter. I certainly have always preferred the Great Hall to the House of Representatives, but at least the structure of it this time is by way of invitation rather than some so-called joint sitting of dubious constitutionality. So at least it is a step forward, although I still would suggest that the Great Hall is more appropriate and that we do have some codified set of procedures for these sorts of things.
