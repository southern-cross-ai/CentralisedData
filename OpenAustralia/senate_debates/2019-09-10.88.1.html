         I thank Senator Scarr for that question.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">

         is a country that I, like Senator Payne and many others in this chamber, have a deep respect and affinity for. I'm very proud to report to this chamber that Australia's defence partnership with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         is longstanding, deep and built on shared history and friendship—and I think, as Senator Payne would agree, on rugby league. My recent five-day visit to PNG last month for the 27th ministerial forum really reinforced the strength of our maritime, air, infrastructure and people-to-people links. It also coincided with the 40th anniversary of our Defence Cooperation Program—Australia's largest, at $42 million annually. It was wonderful to see the breadth and depth of the relationships that extend between our two forces. In Wewak, I opened Camp Key, a new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNGDF" rel="nofollow">
          PNGDF
         </a>
         training facility at Moem Barracks, funded through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCP" rel="nofollow">
          DCP
         </a>
         . It was built by ADF and PNGDF soldiers working side by side under Exercise Puk Puk. I also saw strong people-to-people links on display at Wewak, with fully integrated ADF and PNGDF platoons working side by side, fully integrated, to develop their skills and their joint capabilities as part of Exercise Wantok Warrior.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minister Soloma and I saw our air relationship in action when we travelled to his home town of Okapa in the DCP-funded PNGDF helicopter. Wonderfully, it was flown by army lieutenant Joshua Pondros, a pilot who completed his flying qualifications through the DCP.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am confident that, as partners, we are working together, defence force by defence force, to support Papua New Guinea's sovereign priorities in the areas of nation-building infrastructure towards a resilient and sovereign Papua New Guinea. Together we are investing in the PNG of tomorrow to support a sovereign capability.

            I thank the senator for that question, and yes I can. During the visit, I saw that, as maritime nations and near neighbours, Australia is working with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
             PNG
            </a>

             Manus Island

            It was a joyous occasion, where I learned that my Manusian dancing style is probably not quite up to scratch! But it was a joyous occasion. This wharf will enable the

Our increased cooperation in Manus is a natural extension of our assistance and work together under our Pacific Maritime Security Program, a 30-year program to build

                Solomon Islands
               </a>

                Australian Defence Force
               </a>
               working together, side by side, to conduct Exercise Coastwatchers in the Western and Choiseul provinces of Solomon Islands. This important activity is now in its third year, and it develops our forces' ability to plan, conduct and support remote policing and law enforcement activities and also, importantly, to exercise humanitarian assistance and disaster relief responses. This year's exercise was specifically focused on strengthening the Solomon Islands' ability to police remote areas of its exclusive economic zone, a high priority for the Solomon Islands' government and one that Australia was incredibly proud to support. I thank all of our men and women in uniform, both in
