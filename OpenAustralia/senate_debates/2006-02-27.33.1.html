        But it was a very good interjection. My question is directed to Senator Santoro, the Minister for Ageing. Does the minister recall saying on the
        <i>
         7.30 Report
        </i>
        last week that the complaints system is ‘working well’? Does the minister recall saying on
        <i>
         Lateline
        </i>
        on the same day that the complaints system ‘needs to be finetuned’ and that some complaints ‘fall through the cracks’? Does the minister recall releasing a statement the same day convening an urgent summit on elder abuse in the wake of the reported abuse at the George Vowell centre? Can the minister now indicate what his current position is? Is the complaint system working or do some complaints fall between the cracks? Do we need to have an urgent summit to overhaul the whole system? What is the current position?

         The senator opposite heard me correctly in all instances, but I will explain so that he can understand today what he did not understand the other day. Throughout this sad and sorry saga, after the unfortunate incident came to my attention, I have always maintained that I am open to suggestions from residents, from relatives, from providers and from professionals within the aged care industry as to how we can improve the system. I remain as open to suggestions for improvement as I was in the interviews that I did last week.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can say to the honourable senator opposite that yesterday I was made aware of a survey in relation to the complaints resolution scheme. For the benefit of the senators opposite, what happens is that every time a complaint comes in a survey form is sent out. People respond to that, and 49 per cent of all the people in a 12-month period who submitted complaints to the complaints resolution scheme responded. Of those 49 per cent, only six per cent expressed dissatisfaction with the complaints system.

I can inform the Senate that there has been a review of the complaints resolution scheme undertaken by the complaints ombudsman. I am currently looking at that review and I am in the process of determining whether or not any further action—

                               I just do not see how senators opposite can object to me consulting with the people who know the system. I just cannot see how the people opposite can reasonably object to me consulting with the chief stakeholders, including residents and advocates on behalf of residents. If there is something wrong with that, they should send me an email or a memo and explain where, in fact, I am getting it wrong. But I intend to fully consult the aged care community. I assure senators in the chamber that we will do so expeditiously.

                                  was right when he said that the minister’s best position is beside himself. Can the minister confirm that he has postponed his urgent summit on elder abuse? Given the serious nature of this issue and the legitimate concerns in the community over recent reports, why is the minister now delaying his summit for another two weeks? That does not sound to me like it is expeditious. Is this now a non-urgent crisis summit? Is it not vital that the community regains its confidence in the aged care complaints system? What is the minister’s position today on the effectiveness of the aged care system in protecting the elderly?

                                   , when asked that question, I informed the public, including senators opposite interested in this issue, that I would convene a meeting of the aged care ministerial council. Yesterday, on Sunday, through a media release that has been reported in today’s press, I announced that that would be on 14 March—that is, Tuesday week. I have not postponed any meeting. I announced that there will be a meeting and yesterday I announced the date. That meeting will go ahead. Subsequent to that meeting, I will inform the Senate of the outcomes of the committee’s deliberations.
