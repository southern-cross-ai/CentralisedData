        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Gerry Hanssen, a member of the Western Australian Liberal Party, has been fined more than $60,000 by the Federal Court for illegally blocking union officials from a building site where a worker had died after falling some 13 floors. Mr Hanssen has also been fined for exploiting foreign workers. Will the Prime Minister now call for Mr Hanssen to be expelled from the party he leads?

         Obviously all Australians—employers, employees and unions—need to comply with the law. Later this week in the House of Representatives, and then at some point in the Senate, all senators will have an opportunity to ensure that everyone is required to comply with the law, and that is particularly important on building sites.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to Mr Hanssen, obviously the same would apply to him as well. I'm aware of the report on the weekend. I'm also aware that Mr Hanssen has made clear that he has stopped donating to the Liberal and National parties because 'in principle they were not listening to me'—that's a quotation from him. But Labor is quite dishonestly seeking to conflate issues here, to compare the actions of Gerry Hanssen with the actions of John Setka in order to relieve pressure on themselves for their failure to remove him from the Labor Party.

           This is a question that relates to a fine in relation to a circumstance where a worker tragically died. And it would I think be an appropriate thing if the minister treated the question with a level of seriousness, given the seriousness of the subject matter.

             Appropriately, Mr Hanssen was subject to court proceedings, and the law of the land has applied to him. But the law of the land should be applied to all actors in this space, without fear or favour. That is entirely appropriate.

               Mr Hanssen has donated as much $175,000 to the federal and Western Australian Liberal and National parties over the past five years or so. Did Minister Cormann, Minister Cash or any other member of the executive solicit these donations from the law-breaking Mr Hanssen?

               <p>
                As Senator Pratt well knows, all political donations are declared, consistent with our laws, openly and transparently through the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
                 AEC
                </a>
                . I'm not personally aware of ever having solicited or received any donations from Mr Hanssen. But let me make the overall point again: the government condemns all breaches of workplace laws, whether it's by unions, employers or employee groups. Of course, anyone who is guilty of breaching the law should be subject to relevant court action, which is what happened on this occasion. What we are suggesting—and what Labor is obviously fighting against with this line of questioning—is that the courts should have more tools available to deal with consistent breaches of the law by militant unions.
