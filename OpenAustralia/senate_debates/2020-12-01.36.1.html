        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Government Services, Senator Ruston. In question time yesterday the minister claimed, 'As soon as we became aware that the method of debt collection was not valid, the Morrison government immediately ceased the robodebt scheme.' When did the government first become aware that the Hon. Scott Morrison's robodebt scheme was not valid?

                   is a unique case. Some of those cases found in one direction; some of the cases found an alternative outcome. So to come in here and suggest that the outcomes of an AAT form the basis of legal advice to government I think is a misrepresentation of what the AAT process actually does.

                   As I said yesterday, as soon as the government was aware that the income compliance program was not collecting or determining its debts on a valid basis, which was income matching, we acted very quickly—and I stand by that—to cease that program and put in place a program to enable the repayment of those debts.
