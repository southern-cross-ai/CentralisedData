        I'm really excited to be asking my question today, and I'm excited because I'm the first senator to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry a question on Australia's agriculture industry. Minister, I've learnt that Australia has never had sustainable and predictable biosecurity funding, and last night's budget marked a historic moment for Australia's agriculture industry, with the Albanese government delivering—

          That's alright, President. Thank you. The excitement! I can't hold myself! But, as I was saying, last night the Albanese-Labor government marked a historic moment: the first time that the government is investing in our agriculture industry, delivering sustainable funding for biosecurity. So, Minister, could you please explain to the Senate how the budget delivers on the government's election commitment to provide sustainable long-term funding to biosecurity to protect our $90 billion agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries?

           Well, Senator Ciccone, the only thing that I think tops the level of excitement you have in asking that question is my excitement in answering the question. It is good to get a question from a senator about agriculture. It would appear the National Party have completely vacated the field.
          </p>
          <p>
           This morning a new era dawned for Australian agriculture. For the first time ever, Australia has a sustainable biosecurity funding model. This will be a lasting Labor legacy of the Albanese government in the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio, something that not one, not two and not three—all recycled—agriculture ministers from the National Party were ever able to achieve. The Albanese government is locking in higher, ongoing and more predictable biosecurity funding from year to year. We have drawn a line under years of stopgap temporary funding from coalition governments that put our agriculture industry at risk.
          </p>
          <p>
           This decision of the Albanese government in last night's budget will result in more than $1 billion of additional funding for biosecurity, including $845 million to support biosecurity operations across the country, protecting our valuable agricultural industries. Isn't it good that at last we've got a Labor government standing up for our agriculture sector and biosecurity, rather than the mess we inherited from the other side?
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, how will we pay for this? This is a good question. Importers will contribute about 48 per cent of the total cost through their clearance costs, with increased fees and charges expected to take their total contribution to biosecurity costs to almost $390 million from next year. This includes expanded cost recovery to include the biosecurity clearance costs of parcels and non-letter mail. We know the other side didn't want to pass on the costs of these services to industry, and that's why they were on the verge of bankrupting the

            Department of Agriculture
           </a>
           , until we took charge. Taxpayers will contribute about 44 per cent of the total funding, about $350 million, and we'll also introduce a modest new biosecurity protection levy on agriculture producers, which will see them contribute six per cent—

             Minister, thank you very much for that answer. As we know, sadly this government has had to fund the department. Otherwise, it would have been defunded. But could you please explain to the Senate why it is important that all beneficiaries of a strong biosecurity system need to contribute to funding the certainty for that system in order to make sure that our farmers have certainty in the long term?

             <p>
              Thank you, Senator Ciccone. I'd be delighted to do so. As I say, biosecurity is a shared responsibility. What that means, under our new funding system, is that importers will contribute about 48 per cent of the total cost of biosecurity and taxpayers will contribute about 44 per cent, with producers being asked to pay a modest six per cent of the cost of biosecurity protections that will stop them from adding devastating diseases that will destroy their crops and destroy their livelihoods.
             </p>
             <p>
              As we know, we are not the only people who think biosecurity is a shared responsibility. I note that this view attracted support in the consultation process that we undertook last year. The Cattle Council of Australia, as it was known at the time, said that biosecurity is a shared responsibility and that, for our biosecurity measures to be most effective, all parties must contribute. The
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers'_Federation" rel="nofollow">
               National Farmers' Federation
              </a>
              said that biosecurity is a shared responsibility and that, as such, all biosecurity beneficiaries, including the community, the economy at large, the agricultural sector and the environment, should invest in biosecurity activities. We will finally have sustainable biosecurity funding.

                  It is a landmark, and it is historic, because it never happened once under the 10 years of coalition government. But you don't have to take my word for it. Today I see that the Australian Fresh Produce Alliance have said that the additional funding is welcome and will strengthen Australia's biosecurity to help ensure that our nation is better protected. In contrast, the Liberal and National parties had nine long years but did nothing to secure permanent, sustainable, long-term funding for biosecurity. But their incompetence on these matters went beyond that. A conga line of incompetent and economically illiterate National Party agricultural ministers left us with funding cliffs in vital frontline areas that would have seen biosecurity funding fall by nearly 20 per cent this year if we hadn't acted. They failed to maintain the integrity of cost recovery. They said they'd introduce a container levy. They backed down under pressure, and then they went out to set up the department to explain it. And let's not forget about the

                   . Minister, middle-class families with surging mortgage payments, surging grocery bills and surging energy costs have little to celebrate in last night's budget. Labor's budget confirms that cost-of-living continues to go up, gas and electricity bills continue to skyrocket, real wages have not grown, inflation remains stubbornly high, unemployment will rise, and Australians will pay higher taxes. Given that under Labor's budget a family with kids will be around $25,000 worse off, why is Labor making life harder for middle-class Australians?

                      I think the opposition have had to dust off the dodgy calculator that they used to put budgets together in the past, to come up with this set of numbers that they keep shouting across the chamber. This budget is a very strong budget for all Australians. We don't seek to divide as they do. We don't seek to carve up the country into a series of demographics and different age groups and different income groups. We make decisions on what is right for the country based on the economic circumstances of the time. That is why the cost-of-living package is targeted.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      But here are some things in the budget that they did not take into account. We have the fastest wage growth since 2009. Real wages are growing, with a historic lift in wages for aged-care workers. How about that? What about the low unemployment? More people are earning more in more jobs.

                          The work that we did put in place caps on energy prices that they voted against. Look at what it says in the budget paper—a 25 per cent reduction in what people will spend on their energy bills. They voted against it. What about the jobs to be generated in the energy transition to a net zero economy and the investments we are making to drive those opportunities? What about them? They voted no to those as well.

                           Order! There are many opportunities across this week for senators to have a say on the budget or any other matter. Question time is not one of them unless you are one of the people that is asking a question.

                            Our investment in child care will start on 1 July. Again, we're helping households across Australia. There are a number of measures in this budget that are targeted to help people—

                              show this morning, Corey from Perth, a mortgage holder with a family, had this message for the Prime Minister regarding last night's budget: 'The government's not listening. They're not caring. They don't. And this budget proves that they don't care if you work. They say, "We're just going to slog you harder," and that's the way they want it.' Given that under Labor's budget a family with kids will be around $25,000 worse off, why is Labor making it harder for Australians like Corey?

                                   It's a robust contest, but this answer has not yet had any period without interjections—not one. I've left it a long time. I would ask you to call them to order.

I appreciate that people have questions to ask, but, when a question is asked, we are all entitled to hear the answer. I'm asking for order in this chamber and for all senators to be respectful of one another. Minister

                                        Thank you, President.

That benefits all Australians. The tripling of the bulk-billing rate benefits all Australians, making sure the investments in Medicare work for everybody—

                                            I raise a point of order in relation to interjections. You just had Senator Wong, during the previous answer, provide commentary of concern about continuous interjections. We've seen nothing but continuous interjections coming directly from Senator Wong during the bulk of the 23 seconds that Senator Cash has been attempting to ask this question.

                                             I am more than willing to pull up individual senators for the behaviour. You would have heard that I did call Senator Wong to order before you stood, and I appreciate your point of order, but I would reiterate that there have been many interjections today, many points of disorder, from a range of senators. I take the point on Senator Wong. I called Senator Wong to order. I would expect, when Senator Cash finishes her question, that all senators in this place will listen to the answer in respectful silence. Senator Cash, I'm going to ask you to start your question again, and I don't want to hear any interjections.

I'm now asking all of you in here to listen to the answer, whether you agree with it or not, in respectful silence. Minister, please continue.

                                                   Senator Cash's question included a reference to the young man's wages and how he had been feeling the pinch on wages. We agree. That's why we put the industrial relations changes through this parliament, with the more jobs, better pay bill. You opposed it. You opposed improvements to the industrial relations system that would allow workers to have a better crack at wage opportunities through the bargaining system. You've opposed our position on arguing for wages growth on the minimum wage, through our minimum wage cases. You didn't make the commitment to fund the aged-care workers wage claim—15 per cent in this budget found room for it on top of all the other things we had to do. We're absolutely determined to get wages moving, and this budget shows that we will have real wages growth, faster than had previously been expected.
