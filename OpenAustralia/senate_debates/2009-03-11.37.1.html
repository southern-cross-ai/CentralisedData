        —that has quite a good ring to it, don’t you think—is moving to part-privatise the

         I thank Senator Brown for that question, and I appreciate the notice given—albeit brief. I have here chapter 6 of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         platform, which reads ‘
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Post
         </a>
         ’. Section 124 states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         124          Labor will maintain Australia Post in full public ownership.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1125        Labor will maintain Australia Post as the sole carrier of the standard-size, letter service and the sole issuer of postage stamps. Cross-subsidy arrangements between metropolitan and regional Australia will remain to ensure an equitable, flat-rate postal charging arrangement for the standard letter.
        </p>
        <p>
         So I assure Senator Bob Brown that there is no intention on the part of the Rudd government to entertain any form of privatisation of Australia Post. I am aware of the recent announcements made by the Brown government and I am viewing them, but not with a great deal of interest.

           Yes, I was very much concentrating on Chelsea’s victory over Juventus today. Let me be clear: as far as I am aware—and I will check this with my department and my office—we have received no approaches for privatisation or part-privatisation of any parts of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
            Australia Post

           . I am aware of occasional commentary in the newspaper where people speculate about issues around this. I am happy to come back and correct the record but I do not believe we have received any approaches whatsoever in this area.

             I was being modest; I read only the first couple of paragraphs from the platform, Senator Brown, but I am happy to inform you of the rest of the platform. It says:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             126          Labor will encourage the growth of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
              Australia Post
             </a>
             ’s services and extend the scope of Australia Post’s community service obligations, where appropriate, to ensure equitable access to a full range of postal services for all Australians, including financial and bill paying services.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             127          Labor will ensure that Australia Post continues to maintain appropriate coverage of post office and post box outlets throughout Australia. Labor will ensure that the present Australia Post corporate retail outlets remain publicly owned and operated and that the current ownership mix will be maintained.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is more but I am not sure how much more categorical the platform or I could be on this matter. The prospects for Australia Post into the coming year are like the rest of the economy; revenues are being affected by the downturn. We would anticipate a reduced dividend and profit from this year—
