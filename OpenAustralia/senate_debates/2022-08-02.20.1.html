        ( Today I have the honour of sharing, in her own words, a statement from Melissa, a person struggling to survive on the on the meagre JobSeeker payment:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm on Jobseeker with a reduced capacity to work due to chronic illness and disability. I live on 330 dollars a week. It was hard to survive before inflation hit but now it's devastating.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm great at budgeting but now budgeting means not buying the basics. It means rationing out food to last a fortnight. If I've budgeted well I can eat one meal a day. If another expense comes up I have to choose which days I need to skip food completely. I try to choose days I have no appointments so I can sleep through the hunger.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In November last year I was diagnosed with scurvy and malnutrition. Let that sink in. A country as wealthy as Australia and I'm unable to eat enough good food to get the nutrients I need to live. This has a devastating effect on my health. How can I possibly get work-ready when I can't afford to live? Yet jobseekers are expected to be able to find employment under these conditions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Prices are rising and Jobseeker isn't. I'm isolated from my community and have lost countless friends because I can't afford to grab a coffee with them. There's nothing to look forward to and I've become hopeless â€¦ It's day after day of being in survival mode. It's stressful and it's demeaning.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But you have the power to change that for me and millions of others. Poverty is a policy choice. Instead of punishing us for not being employed you could take a chance that raising job seeker would also raise our chances for getting work-ready.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's time to start fighting poverty and not the poor!
