        I rise to speak about the speech given by Senator Fierravanti-Wells last night. Of course it upset the Liberal Party, and of course it upset the Prime Minister. Hence he came out and said, 'It's from a scorned woman.' I can say: it's not. It's from a woman who has given a lot to this parliament and who has represented the people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        to the best of her ability. It's about talking about a prime minister who is not in touch with the Liberal Party or the people of this nation, who has lost the values of conservatism, and that's exactly what has upset Senator Fierravanti-Wells.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
         The Liberal Party

        is not the Liberal Party that should be there to represent the views and values of this nation on the conservative side. It's a party that has been taken over by the moderates and those on the left. It's a party full of factions. It's a party that is trying to get rid of the true conservatives, and that's why a lot of their voters are coming across to

        and supporting us.

        It wasn't the Prime Minister who wanted the apprenticeship scheme, though he stands there talking about it. It was One Nation's apprenticeship scheme. We have over 100,000 apprentices out there because of One Nation. It wasn't the Liberal Party that stood up for many issues that have been supported by One Nation. When the Prime Minister stands up and says he's against vaccine mandates, but in the supply budget wants to give money to get children from birth to four years of age vaccinated. Yet he does absolutely nothing to listen to the Australian people who do not want to be forced, coerced or blackmailed into getting a vaccine into their bodies against their will. This is not a prime minister for the people.

        He is a bully, and I back the senator up completely on that. He is a bully. I have experienced it myself. He's a man who says, 'You do it my way or there's no way.' And it's a shameâ€”
