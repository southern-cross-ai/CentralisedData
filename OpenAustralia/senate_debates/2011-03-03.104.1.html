        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Can the minister inform the Senate what steps the government is taking to ensure businesses are ready to meet the challenges of climate change?

         I thank Senator Carol Brown for her question. I think it is well known that business leaders and union leaders have repeatedly made clear their view that enterprises have to adapt to the challenges of climate change. This is the reality of the 21st century.

                     , has made it very clear that the approach that the government is taking to this whole issue is that we have to find a mechanism to price carbon that would ‘provide businesses with the confidence needed to undertake long-term investments in low emissions technology and infrastructure, which will reduce costs for households and businesses in the long-term’.

                     What we have, of course, is the complete contrast of that approach from that taken by those opposite. That is the great pity here. There is a genuine opportunity here for business to engage in a serious public policy debate, and that opportunity extends to the Liberal Party if they were to choose to take it up. What in fact we have seen from the Liberal Party is the view that they should turn their backs on the future of this country—they should turn their backs on the prosperity of the people of this country.

                       We are finding at the moment that the Leader of the Opposition has been travelling the country peddling humbug and hysteria. It has been clear that the climate change deniers, who have now seized control of the Liberal Party, are seeking to peddle doubt and uncertainty in people’s minds. We have seen that many people, including the member for Wentworth, have said the Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is nothing other than crap and that we do not need to do anything about it. What Mr Turnbull has been saying is that any policy that is announced will simply be a con—an environmental fig leaf to cover the determination to do nothing. So there is a very sharp contrast between the position that is taken by those on this side of the chamber, which is to defend the scientists and the rigour of the scientific method—
