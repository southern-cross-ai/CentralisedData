       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of all answers to questions without notice asked today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will start by saying that the performance by Senator Wong was quite unbecoming. It was basically just a shouting match to try and shut down the fact that the Labor government has no plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Christmas" rel="nofollow">

        , we will see tens of thousands of Australians living out on the streets as a result of Labor's reckless government throughout the last 18 months. For the first 16 months, all they could focus on was virtue signalling with their identity politics and the Voice, and $450 million was wasted on nothing. While this was happening, they opened up the borders and allowed the floodgates to open. We saw a rise in immigration, which is now tracking to be 600,000 annually. On top of that, we've now seen the release of 143 hardened criminals, five of which have already breached their conditions. Not only have we got homelessness, high energy prices, a high cost of living and high rents, but now we've got criminals out on the streets. That echoes what's going on in my home state of Queensland, where crime is through the roof. We've got ambulance ramping through the roof. Why? Because we have Labor governments in power across the country, who do not know how to manage the economy or how to uphold law and order. It is a great concern. If anyone was going to play the Grinch this Christmas, it would have to be Prime Minister Albanese, because so many people are doing it tough.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this week, we saw a pathetic attempt by Senator Watt to make a big statement to Coles and Woolworths. He wants to put a cap on the price of ham. Well, I can assure you that the price of ham is the least of people's problems, as they struggle to fill the tanks, as they're sitting out there waiting for an ambulance to arrive, as they're sitting there on a Saturday morning looking for a place to rent, as they log on to their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBank" rel="nofollow">
         NetBank
        </a>
        accounts only to find that their credit card has been maxed out, or as they're waiting to hear back from their insurance company because their car has been broken into. Law and order is out of control. The cost of living is out of control.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then we've got our poor old farmers out there in regional Australia, who are doing it tough. Many times I've touched on how the decline of essential services is gutting regional Australia. Labor's response to that is to introduce the nature repair bill, which is basically going to pay wealthy foreigners to come in, buy Australian land and shut it down. That will only destroy more jobs in the regions, which will then flow into the cities and destroy more jobs as the Labor government destroys Australia, destroys its economy and eventually shuts everything down. The question has to be: how much longer can the people, the hard workers of Australia, sustain this type of pressure? That is the question that we will see in 2024.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is one thing that has shocked me. Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, cost of living should have always been front and centre. You would have thought that, regardless of the outcome, coming out of the referendum Labor would have had a plan to deal with the cost of living. But they haven't got a plan. Their only plan is to keep immigration high and to keep subsidising more foreign built and foreign owned renewables. That is driving up the cost of energy, that is sending businesses offshore and that is basically shutting down our agricultural sector and our mining sector. Those two sectors are what's keeping Australia afloat. The other thing we've seen in these last two sitting weeks is that we're basically now pulling 450 gigalitres out of the Murray-Darling system only for it to flow down to the Lower Lakes and evaporate. We've already got 900 gigalitres evaporating in the Lower Lakes down there.

          and a true Australian, she would be arguing to build a lock above the Lower Lakes. I'll challenge you to that, Senator Wong. You keep the freshwater in a lock above the Lower Lakes, where you've got freshwater. You can use that for irrigation rather than letting it flow into the Lower Lakes, where it just evaporates. It is crazy to think that you would push all that water and just divert it from the east coast to the southern coast. Millions of dollars were spent by

           What an opportunity I have today after that rambling from the senator opposite. If those on the opposition benches over there really cared about the cost of living, they would not have voted against every measure of relief that this government has put forward through this chamber. Let's be clear: what's really got them riled up is that historic legislation, the closing the loopholes bill, passed the Senate today. Why? Because they do not believe in fairer workplaces. They do not believe in fair pay. They do not support workers' rights to be safe at work. They have had lots of opportunities to support Australian workers, but they haven't. This is all because of the labour-hire loophole. Wage theft will finally be made a crime, and workers will benefit from safer workplaces across this country. The reforms have been 18 months in the making.

              They interject because they don't like to be reminded. But the Australian community actually understand and know very well that it was those opposite who kept Australian wages down. They voted against aged-care workers getting a pay increase. So now, when we're making wage theft a criminal act, they want to interject. They say they stand by businesses. Well, we stand by businesses who do the right thing by Australian workers. That's what we do. Each and every Labor government will always be there to protect Australian workers. But they won't. Those opposite don't actually support Australian workers.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have also introduced in this legislation a new criminal offence of industrial manslaughter. This is so long overdue. I'm very proud to stand here, as a member of the Albanese Labor government, because these things could have happened in the 10 years that those opposite had the government benches, but they did nothing. They admitted that their wages policy was always to keep wages down. That's their policy. We also know about the devastation of asbestos and how devastating that has been to the Australian community, and we want to expand the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to include silica. We also want to close the loophole by which large businesses claim small business exemptions during insolvency to avoid redundancy payments.
             </p>
             <p>
              Australians deserve to not be exploited at work. Part of the Labor Party's platform—and certainly the Labor government's platform—has always been to improve pay and conditions. We also want to close the pay gap between males and females. That gap is closing and is the smallest gap we have seen in this country. Why? Because of a Labor government.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding the questions in relation to rural and regional Australia, we've brought in measures to give greater access to urgent care clinics so you can see a doctor and be bulk-billed. You won't need a credit card to see your doctor. These are things that are going to help everyone, whether you live in rural and regional Australia or you live in our cities. Going back to the closing loophole reforms, the other important elements include minimum standards for digital platform gig workers, our road transport industry reforms—these are good for all Australians—and a better deal for casual workers who want to become permanent. I've spoken in here before about workers down on the north-west coast of Tasmania who've been working for the same company for 14 years on a casual rate and who can't get a permanent job and can't get a home loan from a bank because they don't have a permanent job. These are the things that this legislation does—and there is more to come, so you can take it away for Christmas. Australian workers are going to be better protected from today and from this year because of a Labor government.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would like to take the last 30 seconds of this speech to thank the workers in this parliament for the work that they do to help democracy run smoothly in this place and the other chamber, and to wish them and their families a very happy and safe Christmas, and I wish everyone a better new year. I hope that people come back here ready to debate with a bit more dignity and a bit more respect and that we have peace in the world.

               With this last Senate day of the year, Labor have again shown that they will do anything but provide an honest answer to questions that are asked in this place. Preparing for my contribution on the take note debate today, I did note that I had the great responsibility of being one of the speakers in the debate on the last sitting day of last calendar year. I looked back through that contribution to see what I said and whether or not it was still timely and relevant. You'll be pleased to know, Mr Deputy President, that it is. On 1 December 2022, I said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Right now, under

                Anthony Albanese
               </a>
               and Labor, we have an economy with high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and skyrocketing costs of living.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here we are, 12 months down the track, and not a lot has changed.
              </p>
              <p>
               We've seen, time and time again, government members attempting to deflect just criticism made against them, go off on rambling tangents and flat out reject answering questions. I will give them this, they are certainly consistent in that regard. If you cast your mind back to before the election and before this government was in power, they were telling everybody who would listen that they would be a government of transparency and accountability and openness. It's almost as if they went out of their way to say whatever they thought would get them across the line on election night back in May 2022, but with absolutely no intention of holding true to these promises. They made promises like fixing the cost of living and providing Australians with cheaper mortgages, which, as I said, was one of the exact same things we were talking about on this day last year.
              </p>
              <p>
               This government has failed to realise that when they fail to answer questions, when they go out of their way to deflect valid and just criticism, when they dither, when they stall and when they stumble they are treating this place and the Australian public with absolute contempt. This government has serious questions to answer, from economic policy to migration to matters to national security. But what did we see and hear in question time today? We saw government ministers trying to downplay the situation and its consequences and trying to pretend it isn't their problem.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's look at the government's record on economic management—or, should I say, economic mismanagement. This government has failed to address the cost-of-living crisis that is currently plaguing Australians. Let's not forget, Anthony Albanese and Labor were the ones who promised Australians they would 'fix' the cost-of-living crisis. That was before the election, and now that they are in government all we've seen from this government is broken promise after broken promise after broken promise, and their promise to fix the cost-of-living crisis is just the same. It is hurting Australian families who are struggling to keep on top of the cost-of-living pressures as they try to manage their weekly household budgets, and in the lead-up to Christmas that is only getting harder. The costs of household staples, including groceries and filling the car with petrol, are only going up. For all their promises, things have only become worse under this Labor government.

              <p>
               And it wasn't long before we saw Labor trying to attribute blame to anyone and everything else. They just didn't—and still don't—want to take responsibility for their contribution to the cost-of-living crisis. They started complaining about the challenges of the economy and blaming external pressures for the spiralling cost of living. But we know that this narrative has been refuted by the

               governor, who recently confirmed that Australia's world-leading inflation is being driven by domestic factors, not overseas—homegrown inflation. The Reserve Bank governor said, in relation to Australia's inflation rate, that the remaining inflation challenge we are dealing with is 'increasingly homegrown and demand driven'. Labor cannot continue to blame external factors for having an adverse impact on the economy, and Australians are increasingly aware that Labor is incapable of managing the economy and delivering on its promises.

               But it doesn't stop there. Rising interest rates are pushing already-strained budgets as Australians struggle with increasing mortgages. The

               's decision to hold interest rates at 4.35 per cent this week is cold comfort for hardworking Australians with a mortgage, particularly, as I said, in the lead-up to Christmas. This government has overseen a dozen interest rate rises—and that is one thing that has actually changed since this time last year, when I last spoke on this debate—which means the average mortgage holder is paying $24,000 a year more in interest repayments. As we approach Christmas, families will be paying even closer attention to their household budgets. It should be a time for celebration and happiness, but unfortunately so many hardworking Australian families will be forced to make tough financial decisions through no fault of their own, because of this government.

               In the remaining time I have left, given that this is the last day of the Senate for the year: have a merry Christmas, everybody, and a happy new year.

                Well, I delight in taking note of the answers to questions asked by senators opposite today, because every question has given our government an opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to staying focused on what matters to Australians. We know that cost of living is at the top of people's agenda. But what have we got from those opposite? We had from the Leader of the Opposition a leadership that saw votes against cost-of-living relief, opposition to reform of wages and conditions and opposition to wage rises, in effect, after keeping wages low for a decade purposefully. You can do as much shouting from your position opposite as you like, but that obstruction and aggression does nothing to assist our nation.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have delivered targeted relief while not adding to inflation. And it's quite remarkable, really, when you hear the incoherence of those opposite when it comes to any alternative economic agenda. They opposed electricity bill relief, which we have seen roll out right around the country, including in my own home state of WA. Gallingly, they opposed making medicines cheaper. We have also made it easier and cheaper to see a doctor. We've introduced cheaper child care, expansions of paid parental leave, more social and affordable housing, increases in rent assistance, and fee-free
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
                 TAFE
                </a>
                . We now have wages rising at the fastest rate for a decade, including for minimum-wage and aged-care workers. When we get questions from those opposite trying to spin their position for the day, nothing can take away from our commitment and strength in focusing, every day and every week, on what matters to Australians. This means delivering on our commitments which are delivering benefits to Australians who are clearly under the pump at this time.
               </p>
               <p>
                But those opposite have nothing positive to offer our nation. They vote against cost-of-living relief when we know Australians are doing it tough. Again, we've seen today, through the opposition's opposition to our industrial law reform package, the embedded and entrenched position and commitment that they have to keeping wages down in our nation. Under their leadership, we saw wages low for a decade, and now we see a purposeful attempt from those opposite to continue to try and divide our nation, when what we really need is to be able to come together. Shouting is no solution for these times. Aggression and obstruction don't help our nation; they hurt it.

                As I note the answers today, Senator Wong was also asked about our agenda for rural and regional Australia. As a government we have invested $3 billion in the agricultural portfolio and a billion dollars more for biosecurity. For the first time, sustainable biosecurity funding is now in place. That is something that those opposite could never deliver. We in this government have opened Medicare urgent care clinics right around the country, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and there are many such clinics up and running in my own home state of WA. I had the great pleasure of opening one such clinic in

                 I listened with great interest to the answer to the first question today from Senator Cash on the unnecessary release of 147 dangerous detainees from immigration detention. I think the Attorney-General's conduct at the press conference yesterday should alarm all Australians and absolutely put into question his fitness for the job as our first law officer. Peta Credlin last night criticised the Attorney-General for trying to use a 'big man's tactic' of 'intellectual intimidation' against a very fine Sky News reporter Olivia Caisley. I actually disagree with Peta Credlin. He is using a big man's tactic and intellectual intimidation, and, as

                 and others have said, it's also probably one of the worst cases of mansplaining. But I think it is so much worse than that and goes against the code of conduct of this place, and it is a very, very clear case of bullying. Let me tell you why.
                </p>
                <p>
                 First of all, let's have a look at what he actually said. Speaking to the media yesterday, he was asked by Sky News political reporter Olivia Caisley whether he; the Minister for

                 , Andrew Giles, would apologise to the Australian people for releasing criminals. Of course he should have apologised to the Australian people. Of course all three of them should have apologised to the Australian people. But instead of saying, 'Yes, we got it wrong,' and respecting the journalist, he pointed his finger at Ms Caisley and called the question 'absurd'. He said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 You are asking a cabinet minister, three ministers of the Crown, to apologise for upholding the law of Australia, for acting in accordance with the law of Australia, for following the instructions of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  High Court of Australia
                 </a>
                 .
                </p>
                <p>
                 How dare an Australian journalist ask this question. He said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 I will not be apologising for upholding the law. I will not be apologising for pursuing the rule of law and I will not be apologising for acting …
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then he pointed, and he said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 Do not interrupt … I will not be apologising for acting in accordance with a High Court decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Of course, he wasn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let me go to the code of conduct of this place. It contains five principles. Principle No. 1 says, 'Act respectfully, professionally and with integrity.' He didn't. He breached the first. The second principle is: 'Encourage and value diverse perspectives and recognise the importance of a free exchange of ideas.' Clearly, he breached the second principle. The third is: 'Recognise your power, influence or authority and do not abuse them. Clearly, as the first law officer of this nation, he has contravened the third principle as well. The fourth is: 'Uphold laws that support safe and respectful workplaces, including anti-discrimination, employment, work health and safety and criminal laws. Clearly, he has breached the fourth guideline. It was not a safe or respectful workplace for the journalist in that place. The fifth principle is: 'Bullying, harassment, sexual harassment or assault, or discrimination in any form, including on the grounds of race, age, sex, sexuality, gender identity, disability, or religion will not be tolerated, condoned or ignored.' Guess what. The first law officer of this nation, the Attorney-General, has managed a hat-trick of five. He has managed, in my opinion and, I'm sure, in the opinion of every average Australian, to break all five of the principles of our code of conduct.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Not only is it a breach of the code of conduct of this place, the behaviour he demonstrated yesterday would not be acceptable in any other workplace in this country—not one—except this place. How can it be that a lot of our journalists have chosen not to report about this? As Peter Dutton observed yesterday, if this was anybody on our side of politics, they would have been drummed out of the parliament already, but there has been not a word. Bullying comes not only in such an overt fashion but in many other fashions. I've run out of time to go through all of those at this time, but those of that office should hang their heads in shame.
