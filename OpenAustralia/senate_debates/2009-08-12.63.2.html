        I seek leave to make a short statement before withdrawing a motion.

        Leave granted.

        I wish to withdraw Business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for today proposing a reference to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        of Senators’ Interests on the accountability regime in relation to sponsored travel, accommodation and hospitality. I have had discussions with Senator Ludwig in relation to this matter on behalf of the government’s position. They have indicated to me that they will not support it. The government have said that they see merit in the proposal but they do not support the mechanism included for developing the proposal. Their position is that it ought to be a matter to be referred to the Procedures Committee. I understand that the opposition has a similar view, therefore the numbers are against me. I note that the Greens were prepared to support my approach, and I am very grateful for that support. I relied on the good advice of the Clerk’s Office in respect of this motion that the Senators’ Interests Committee was the most appropriate committee for this to go to. But it seems abundantly clear that I do not have the numbers and I will take the advice of Senator Ludwig, and indeed the opposition, to push for reform via the Procedures Committee. I seek leave to withdraw the motion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; motion withdrawn.
