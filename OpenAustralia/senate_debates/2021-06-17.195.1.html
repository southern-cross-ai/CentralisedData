        My question is to the minister representing the minister for health, Senator Colbeck. Yesterday the Acting Premier of Victoria,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Merlino" rel="nofollow">
         James Merlino
        </a>
        , said, 'Victorians have turned out in their thousands to get vaccinated, but we can't maintain this rate without certainty about supply from the Commonwealth.' Why has the Morrison government failed to give certainty of supply and forced the Victorian government to stop taking bookings for the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine?

         I thank Senator Ciccone for the question. The Australian government has, in fact, provided additional resources and vaccines to Victoria to assist them through their current circumstance. We've worked very closely with the Victorian government. We've supported them in vaccine supply. There are a significant number of additional vaccines that have been supplied to Victoria to assist them with the rollout, so I don't accept the premise of the question that's been put by Senator Ciccone that we are trying to starve Victorians of vaccine supply. In fact, we've worked very cooperatively to provide additional capacity and additional vaccines in the tens of thousands to Victorians so that they have additional supply to support Victorians who are looking for a vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>
         The announcement today is also obviously going to create some further challenges with the changes in the advice that we received with respect to the Pfizer and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
          AstraZeneca
         </a>
         vaccines. We will follow that advice and we will continue to work with the states towards supporting themâ€”

           , on relevance: I don't want to repeat part of the question, but the quote that I had asked the minister about was directly from the Acting Premier about the lack of certainty about the supply from the Commonwealth. That was the Acting Premier's direct quote, and I ask him to address that part of the question.

            You've emphasised part of the question. I think, with respect, the minister was talking about the supply of vaccines to the state of Victoria, so I think he is directly relevant.

             We have worked very closely with Victoria to support them with supplies. We have provided additional Pfizer vaccines to Victoria to the tune of 150,930 over four weeks. We have provided them 170,000 doses of the

             vaccine over six weeks. And we have provided an additional 330,000 AstraZeneca vaccines to our primary care clinics in Victoria, so that they can be assisted with the current issues they're dealing with. We will continue to work closely with the Victorian government and all the other states to ensure that they have the maximum available supplies to support people to get vaccinated as quickly as possible.

                   My advice from the Victorian government, from three sources, is that aged-care workers remain a priority category for vaccination in Victoria. That advice has been provided to me by three sources within the Victorian government. So I don't accept that workers don't have the vaccine available to them, because I've had it confirmed from three sources within the Victorian government that they remain a priority and that there still are bookings available for aged-care workers if they want to go and get a vaccine.
