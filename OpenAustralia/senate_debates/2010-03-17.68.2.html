           The unions are their friends, not ours. Does the minister agree with the Federation’s view:

           Principals, teachers and parents have raised concerns that some

           Can the minister advise if the Labor government intends to call for an inquiry into the wasteful spending at schools, not only in

              I think, Senator Minchin, it does because the whole issue here, Senator Heffernan, as you would appreciate, is that the Rudd Labor government has invested $63.7 billion in school education in the last three years compared to $33 billion that the Liberals invested in the previous three years while they were in government. This government has almost doubled the funding for schools.
