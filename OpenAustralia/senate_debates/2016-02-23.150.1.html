        The
        <i>
         Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines
        </i>
        (CGRGs) were introduced in July 2014 to reflect changes in legislation, Government policy and recommendations of ANAO audit reports. The CGRGs explicitly state that decision-makers who approve a commitment of relevant money in relation to a grant
        <i>
         must
        </i>
        record, in writing, the basis for the approval relative to the grant guidelines and key consideration of value with relevant money (CGRGs 4.5 and 4.11).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to the CGRGs, the Department of Finance (Finance) has published guidance on the Finance website to assist entities and ministers comply with the requirements, including in Resource Management Guide No. 412 Australian Government Grants - Briefing and Reporting. Finance will continue to periodically update this guidance material, including taking into account recent ANAO audit findings.

       <p class="italic">
        The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement (the committee) tabled its report into its
        <i>
         Examination of the Annual Report of the Australian Federal Police 2013-14
        </i>
        on 14 September 2015
        <i>
         .
        </i>
        The report makes two recommendations. The Australian Government's responses to the Committee's recommendations are provided below.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.22: The Committee recommends that the Australian Federal Police include greater detail in the Annual Report with reference to all category 1, 2 and 3 complaints, including the period in which they are received, how long they take to investigate and resolve, how many are 'carried over' financial years and what proportion are substantiated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        agrees to the Committee's recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the tabling of the Committee's report on 14 September 2015 and, in response to Recommendation 1, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        included the additional data in its 2014-15 Annual Report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AFP will include this additional data in all future annual reports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4.21: The Committee recommends that the government introduce legislation to re-establish the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement's oversight function with respect to the monitoring, reviewing or reporting on the performance by the Australian Federal Police of its functions under Part 5.3 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Criminal Code
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not agree to the Committee's recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The oversight of AFP's functions under Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code was transferred to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        (PJCIS) in late 2014.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports the transparency and accountability afforded by appropriate Parliamentary oversight of the AFP's functions and activities. However, legislating for the Committee to have duplicative oversight of the AFP's functions under Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code in addition to the PJCIS would create an unnecessary administrative burden on the AFP.
