        University students deserve safety on campus and in residential halls, yet we know that this is so often not their experience. Two hundred and seventy-five students each week are reporting assaults on campuses across the country, according to the 2021 national student safety survey, and we know that survey was done during COVID, when attendance was down, so we know the figures are likely to be higher. Without major changes, thousands of students are at risk. Universities are covering up sexual assaults and protecting their brands instead of their students, while the sector regulator, TEQSA, has been missing in action. Students and advocates including End Rape on Campus, Fair Agenda and the

An independent body to hold universities accountable was also one of the recommendations from the consent laws inquiry report that received support across this chamber from all political parties.

        Today we read that the government is finally floating the idea of a national ombudsman to field students' complaints and hold unis to account. That is encouraging. Federal, state and territory education ministers are meeting next Tuesday to negotiate changes to university governance, and I'm calling on education ministers, including the federal minister, to endorse the establishment of a national ombudsman as a matter of urgency. We don't mind what it's called—'task force' or 'ombudsman'—as long as it is independent, expert led and transparent, with an effective complaints avenue, and actually enforces meaningful accountability for those universities that don't make the grade. I'm calling on the government to establish this national ombudsman and to ensure that it's sufficiently resourced without further delay.
