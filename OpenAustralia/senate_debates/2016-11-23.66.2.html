         Senator Bushby, as you know, earlier today the Prime Minister did make an important national security statement in the other place, particularly in relation to the international efforts against ISIL in Syria and Iraq and on the threat environment in Australia. I can assure the Senate, as the Prime Minister today assured the other place and indeed the Australian people, of this government's commitment to ensuring Australians remain safe, secure and free. The global terrorism threat environment continues to evolve. Even as we speak, Iraqi forces, including units trained by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         , continue in the liberation of the former ISIL stronghold of Mosul. Coalition efforts in Syria and Iraq, which include the ADF, have put ISIL under increasing pressure. As a result of the efforts of Australia and our coalition partners, ISIL is losing territory, finances and fighters. Its illusion of legitimacy is being shattered.
        </p>
        <p>
         But as ISIL loses ground we can expect its fighters to seek to return to their countries of origin, including in our region. I can assure the Senate that our law enforcement and national security agencies have long been prepared for this challenge and are constantly monitoring Australia's threat environment. I can also assure Australians that our agencies, supported by the comprehensive counterterrorism law reforms that this government has introduced in this parliament and the last, are doing everything that is necessary to keep our communities safe from terrorism. Nevertheless, the national terrorism alert level remains at 'probable'.

            As I said at the conclusion of my answer to your initial question, the threat level remains at 'probable'. What that means is that our authorities advise the government that they assess that a terrorism event on the Australian the mainland is likely. That has been the position since 12 September 2014, when the national terrorism threat level was elevated on the advice of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
             ASIO
            </a>
            and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Federal Police
            </a>
            . Since that time, Australia has experienced four terror-related attacks, three of them involving fatalities and one involving serious injury. But it is important to know that 11 attacks in an advanced stage of preparation have been disrupted and prevented by our agencies. We have the robust legislative, policy and operational arrangements in place to deal with the current threat environment.

               I want to acknowledge the support of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Labor Party
               </a>
               and the opposition in relation to Australia's counterterrorism measures. Each of the measures that we have introduced into the parliament in the last three years has had the constructive support of the opposition, and I acknowledge that. But national security, of course, is a broader canvas than counterterrorism alone. I am sorry to say that on other aspects of national security policy the opposition has in recent times declined to maintain a spirit of bipartisanship. We saw that with the caucus's decision some three weeks ago not to support Minister Dutton's strong new measures to keep Australia's borders safe and secure. We saw it as recently as last week in Senator Wong's decision to call into question the American alliance.
