           Labor supports a royal commission into the aged-care sector and we understand why this motion has been moved today: because people with disability have been waiting too long for a royal commission and this government simply hasn't delivered. However, an inquiry into the issues of violence and abuse faced by people with disability will need to be quite different from an inquiry into the aged-care sector. It would need to cover schools, the community and justice. Five peak disability representative organisations have reiterated this call for a separate royal commission stating: 'We have called for a specific disability royal commission for many years because the issues are so big and so systematic that our own royal commission is warranted.' Labor has and is committed to a standalone royal commission and we encourage the government to join us in giving the violence and abuse against people with disability the dedicated focus it deserves.

              The broad focus of the royal commission will be to look at the quality of care provided in residential and in-home care services to senior Australians. It will also include the challenge of providing care to Australians with disabilities living in residential aged care, particularly younger people with disabilities. The government is also engaging in real, immediate and substantial reform to prevent the abuse and neglect of people with disabilities as we roll out the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
               NDIS
              </a>
              , the most significant social reform to improve choice and control for people with disability in the service that they receive.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government is providing $209 million over four years to establish the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, which will address issues raised in recent inquiries, replacing a complex and fragmented system of quality and safeguards in each state and territory with a single, nationally consistent approach under the NDIS.

                 In voting down this motion this afternoon, the opposition and the government vote to continue the enforced silence of Australia's disabled people. Over 500 complaints have been received by the National Abuse Hotline—200 this year! In voting down this motion, you vote to keep their stories silent. You vote against the investigation of the crimes which they have been subjected to. You hide behind your politician's words. You hide behind your excuses. Well, the disability community will remember your cowardice and you will pay for it.
