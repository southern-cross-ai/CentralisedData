        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Carr. I refer the minister to the report by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International" rel="nofollow">
         Amnesty International
        </a>
        entitled
        <i>
         A blow to humanity: torture by judicial caning in Malaysia
        </i>
        , which states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Across Malaysia, government officials regularly tear into the flesh of prisoners with rattan canes travelling up to 160 kilometres per hour. The cane shreds the victim’s naked skin, turns the fatty tissue into pulp, and leaves permanent scars that extend all the way to muscle fibres. Blood and flesh splash off the victim’s body, often accompanied by urine and faeces. This gruesome spectacle is kept hidden from public view.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the Malaysia-Australia transfer agreement is not legally binding, can the minister provide the Senate with an ironclad guarantee that asylum seekers sent by Australia to Malaysia will not under any circumstances at all be caned?

           If the opposition were serious about humanitarian outcomes, surely they would also recognise that the agreement with Malaysia offers the chance for the resettlement of 4,000 refugees who are currently in Malaysia. Those 4,000 under the

           HCR require protection and are awaiting resettlement. I think it is a very disturbing undercurrent in the opposition views about Malaysia that in regard to its commitment to this agreement—

             What we do know is that there are 4,000 refugees in Malaysia who would under the terms of this agreement be able to be moved to Australia. So on the simple question of whether people that are sent to Malaysia will be caned, the answer is no. They will be treated with dignity and with respect in accordance with human rights standards. That clearly means there will be no caning. That is what the agreement makes very clear. It is important to note that the transferees will have legal authority to remain in Malaysia and be able to work. On the other hand, the proposal that the Liberal Party are advancing is to suggest—

                 I come back to the simple point that the agreement makes it very clear that people will not be caned. That is the nature of the agreement. On the other hand, the other part of the agreement, which actually allows for 4,000 refugees who are in Malaysia to be transferred to Australia, is ignored by the opposition. They now want to take it one step further and suggest to us, with extraordinary gall, that their record on human rights—their record in regard to Dr Mohamed Haneef, their record in regard to
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelia_Rau" rel="nofollow">
                  Cornelia Rau
                 </a>
                 , their actions during their time in administration and the mistreatment of refugees and mistreatment of other people's human rights, their constant abuse of Australian law by the deportation of Australians citizens—ought be compared to an agreement which is actually about trying to improve the lot of 4,000 people who are declared refugees and have the opportunity to come to Australia.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. After more than three years of cascading failures on border protection, isn't the government now embarking on a policy that inflicts brutal punishment on men, women and children and more failed policy on the Australian people?

                   The answer is no. The simple proposition that they would have this parliament accept is that their record on human rights is so pristine, so pure, despite their habit of locking up Australian citizens, of deporting Australian citizens, of treating refugees with absolute contempt and as a political football, and of vilifying refugees in this country throughout their time in office.
