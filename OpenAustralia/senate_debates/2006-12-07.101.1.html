        My question is directed to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        . I again refer her to the Ombudsman’s report of yesterday where it reveals that officers of her department knew as far back as September 2002 that Australian citizens, including Australian children with mental health issues, had been detained. Doesn’t this mean that the department knew that Australian citizens had been held in detention long before the media discovered the Rau and Alvarez scandals in 2005? Does the minister stand by her previous claims that this information was not passed up the line and that neither she, nor her predecessor, Mr Ruddock, nor senior departmental officials were ever told about what was going on? Are we to seriously believe that neither the minister nor senior departmental officials got told that Australian citizens, including children, were locked up in detention, despite emails circulating in the department to that effect? Will anyone in the government take responsibility for these appalling cases?

                The question put by Senator Evans related to when people first knew, and I think that is the point that Senator Kirk was asking about. It is the one point that I did not address, so I now seek to do the two together. My understanding, to the best of my knowledge and belief, is that this case came to light publicly for one simple reason: that is, an Australian government minister said, ‘There might be more. You better go back and look.’ That is the only reason, to the best of my knowledge, belief and understanding, that
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_G" rel="nofollow">
                 Mr G

                came to light. It is because in good government instead of legislating away your errors you go and look for them, you own up to them and you fix them.

                 , I ask a supplementary question. I am amazed that the minister takes credit for this scandal, given that it was only as a result of media reports that it was ever uncovered. Does the minister seriously believe that saying that the department have changed and that they were paying monetary compensation to victims is a sufficient response to the terrible injustices revealed and the chronic problems that obviously existed? Rather than arrogantly dismissing the scandals, will the minister and Mr Ruddock finally accept their ministerial responsibility for what occurred on their watch?

                  I thank the senator for his supplementary question. The senator asks me if it is satisfactory to say compensation has been paid. If proper compensation has been paid, yes; if you try to use this parliament to in fact pay a dollar a day because of a mistake that you have made on a technicality, no. So compensation is not always an appropriate and adequate response. My own view is if you limit it to a dollar a day you are not being fair. But if you say a mistake has been made and if appropriate compensation is paid, sometimes that is the best that can be done: someone can be compensated for what has happened. The government’s job is to fix errors, not to legislate them away and hide them, Senator Evans, which is what happened when you were last in a party that was in government.
