        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. I refer to the minister's failure to answer a question yesterday on penalty rates, so I ask again: does the minister support the

                          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to published analysis which shows that workers in regional Australia would lose between $370 million and $691 million a year as a result of cuts to penalty rates. Would cuts to penalty rates further entrench the divide between rural and city workers?

                           As with all these things, these are sensitive matters that impact on the economy on one hand and individual household budgets on the other. That is why in this nation we have an independent umpire, called the Fair Work Commission, to make those determinations. All the

                           remind the honourable senator that the three Productivity Commissioners who considered this matter and who made that recommendation were all appointed under the previous Labor government. These matters need to be balanced on the basis of all the information available and I have confidence that the independent umpire will make an appropriate determination when and if these matters are raised before them, unlike the Labor Party who seem to have no confidence in their own commission.

                               , I rise on a point of order: relevance. The minister is using the same standard answer to run away from direct questions. He really should be dealing with these very important questions that are being put to him and he should be relevant to the standing orders.

                                 I can understand Senator Cameron's huge embarrassment at the record of Mr Shorten in getting rid of penalty rates. There was one review initiated by Mr Shorten and the Labor Party and that was the modern award review. During that process, Labor's independent umpire decided to cut penalty rates in the casual award. Labor's laws, Labor's independent umpires and the workers got a cut in penalty rates. To try to cover up for that and for Mr Shorten's own personal activities, this subterfuge is being raised.
