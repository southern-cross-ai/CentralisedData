        My question today is to the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Senator Colbeck. Lisa's father, 94-year-old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Lee" rel="nofollow">
         Dick Lee
        </a>
        , was allegedly abused at Regis Nedlands. A report details that they:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … found Mr Lee (who is always in a wheelchair) on the floor near the entrance of his room completely unclothed and sitting in his faeces with [a carer] standing over him. I asked [the carer], did he fall? and [the carer] replied with 'no'.
       </p>
       <p>
        The carer was later witnessed dragging Mr Lee into the bathroom. More than 12 months after the royal commission's interim report, entitled
        <i>
         Neglect
        </i>
        , how is this neglect still continuing on this minister's watch?

         Thanks, Senator Pratt, for the question. I will continue to be cautious in the answer to this question with respect to what I say about the specifics of the allegations that have been made in this case, as I was in the question from Senator Sterle. These cases are subject to coroners' inquests. They're subject to independent review processes that have been commissioned and of course they have also been subject to a police investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I will say is that nobody in this place wants to see mistreatment of any senior Australian resident in aged care in this country. That is why we called the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Commission
         </a>
         into Aged Care Quality and Safety, so that we could conduct a comprehensive review of the sector and we could put in place the appropriate regulatory regimes that support high-quality care for all senior Australians in the country.

          I'll take the interjection from the other side. At the last budget, when we put billions of dollars into aged care, what did the opposition put in respect of aged care in their budget in reply? Not a single dollar. A lot of crocodile tears on the other side, but they have done nothing for decades.

            And to get into withdrawals, we also have crocodile tears, which impugns what we are asking when we're asking about neglect. However, I don't propose to go down that path. I'm raising an issue of direct relevance. The minister is asked—I'm sorry?

                   . With respect to the interim report and the COVID-19 report of the royal commission, the government has responded to both of those reports. We have continued to reform the sector—passing new legislation, which places additional responsibilities on the sector. The Serious Incident Response Scheme was passed through this place only last week, so we have continued to reform the sector while the royal commission has continued and we will continue to do so.

                     I make a point of order in relation to conduct in the chamber and interjections. Senator Wong, in making her point of order before, demanded complete silence in the chamber before she spoke. Yet, since Senator Colbeck got back on his feet, Senator Wong has shown nothing but a lack of courtesy in listening to the answer and is showing a double standard in the behaviour she expected while she was on her feet.

                      Order! I'm going to ask that people stop the interjections while I talk. It's the end of a fortnight. I'm going to ask people to restrain themselves. I was attempting to call the chamber to order. I will start raising my voice if I need to. Interjections are not helpful and they are disorderly. Senator Pratt, a supplementary question?

                       A few days after the alleged neglect, Mr Lee became ill, and his daughter's concerns that something was seriously wrong were dismissed. Mr Lee was eventually rushed to hospital, where he was in a coma. He had liver failure and died the next day. When did the minister first become aware of Mr Lee's tragic death, and what action has he taken to ensure this neglect never happens again?

                             Every person in this chamber would abhor any circumstance where a senior Australian has had that circumstance occur. Every single one of us would have that view. That is why this government called the royal commission, because we want to reform this sector in a way that provides high-quality care to senior Australians. That is our objection.
