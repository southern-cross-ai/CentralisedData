           Labor will be opposing this motion. The statutory requirements for governance of Queensland's local government system are established by the Queensland parliament, and any evidence of corruption and wrongdoing in Queensland local government should be referred to the standing royal commission into public sector corruption, the Crime and Corruption Commission.

              won't be supporting this motion either. We have consistently called for greater transparency in funding decisions to stop the pork-barrelling and the rorting that has allowed grant funds to be used to buy outcomes and benefit mates. Concerns regarding misuse of funds by local governments should be investigated, but we understand these matters have been looked into and the councils cleared. Moreover, the types of matters raised in this motion are not matters for the Senate. Unlike the Commonwealth, Queensland has a Crime and Corruption Commission to investigate integrity issues, and any outstanding matters should be referred to them.
