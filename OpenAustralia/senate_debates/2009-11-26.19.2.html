          by leave—The government does not intend to divide on this matter. I am concerned about supporting this motion to establish such an inquiry at this stage. My concerns are somewhat ameliorated by Senator Xenophon’s amendment. Issues relating to the matters covered by this proposed inquiry are currently the subject of several investigations within Defence. Those investigations have not been completed. I hope that by the time the committee begins to take evidence those investigations will be completed. I have, of course, sought advice from Defence on whether any of the current investigations might impact on Defence’s ability to participate in or provide material to the inquiry. When I receive such advice I will need to give it due consideration. Those are important considerations and assessments to make. The approach I have outlined is, I think, appropriate in the circumstances. My concern is about having an ongoing inquiry at this particular stage, given what is occurring in relation to investigations within Defence. Having said that, we will be able to make assessments come February about the status of those inquiries and investigations.
