            AEC
           </a>
           is required to follow the Commonwealth Procurement Rules when conducting procurements. These rules require potential contractors to be treated equitably based on their commercial, legal, technical and financial abilities and not be discriminated against due to their size, degree of foreign affiliation or ownership, location, or the origin of their goods and services. This is an important principle that our exporting businesses also rely on when supplying goods and services to overseas markets. These rules contained in our various export agreements ensure that Australian suppliers are not disadvantaged when tendering for government procurement in countries with which we have such agreements in place. I am advised by the AEC that election material procured by the AEC for the upcoming federal election will be printed within Australia.

               Following Senator Ryan's comments, I want to make the point that our current Commonwealth Procurement Rules do not take into account the social and economic effects of buying local—the effect it has on supply chain, on local jobs and on local economies. The fact is that we have a situation where we can and do produce Australian paper for Australian ballot papers, rather than the many tonnes that are being imported right now for the July 2 election. That seems fundamentally wrong to me, given that Australian jobs are at stake.

                   support the use of Australian paper if it is paper produced from plantation stock and from recycled stock, so it does not involve the destruction of native forests and the destruction of our precious wildlife, including Leadbeater's possums in the forests of the central highlands of Victoria. Australia is perfectly capable of making paper and having Australian jobs—

                    , on a point of order. I am sitting in front of Senator Rice and I point out to the Liberal Party that Senator Heffernan's party is in half an hour, and I am trying to hear Senator Rice's motion

                     Thank you. I remind all senators, particularly those who are on my left at the moment, to keep the noise down to zero whilst we listen to Senator Rice.

                      Australia is perfectly capable of making paper that would create Australian jobs and support Australian industry that is produced from plantations and recycled sources. That is the direction we need to be heading in to make sure that we can get over this divide between protecting our forests and protecting jobs. There should not be a divide. With 85 per cent of the wood products that come from Australia already sourced from plantations, we need to increase this to 100 per cent.
