         I thank Senator Minchin for his ongoing interest. Today is a significant milestone in the government’s
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         request for proposals. In fact, it is a significant day for the Australian telecommunications sector. I have here media statements from Axia, Optus Terria, the Tasmanian government, Telstra, Transact and Acacia indicating that they have submitted proposals to build the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         . The number of bidders competing for the right to build the National Broadband Network is a vindication of the government’s commitment to an open, competitive process facilitating the rollout of this important infrastructure. It is clear from the public statements of bidders to date that the government’s process has produced substantial competitive tension amongst proponents. This competitive tension was important to maximising the quality of proposals received by the government. This competitive tension will ultimately ensure a better outcome for Australia. This has been the government’s overriding objective for the process all along. The government’s independent expert panel will now get down to work and assess these proposals. The request for proposals states that the expert panel will have eight weeks to evaluate these proposals and provide a report to me. It is, however, important to emphasise that the

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to Telstra’s statement today in which they say that their detailed bid has been prepared but ‘could not be submitted due to a number of unresolved issues in the government’s request for proposals.’ Why has the minister sought to mislead this Senate by suggesting that Telstra has submitted a bid?

           Selective quoting is what you expect from a party that consistently failed to deliver after 18 failed broadband plans in nearly 12 years. It is no surprise to see this opposition trying to undermine the process. Let me read to you from the Telstra press release: ‘Telstra believes the Government can consider its proposal under the existing terms of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFP" rel="nofollow">
            RFP
           </a>
           ’. It is pretty simple: Telstra think they have put in a proposal. It could not be clearer than that. So let me be clear: as I was saying, it is, however, important to emphasise that the RFP process for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
