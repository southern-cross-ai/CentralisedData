         <p>
          by leave—I was debating whether I really wanted to take leave to do this again. When this legislation was introduced into the chamber not long ago, the opposition sought to split the procedural matters so that formalities that would normally be granted would have to be put back in place. What that would mean is that they would have to be a day between the status of a particular bill. What we now have is a circumstance where the formalities would be back to the way they usually are—that is, they are usually asked to be waived under standing orders. This is the usual process that happens to all bills; we usually asked for formalities to be dispensed with. In this instance we are simply asking again for those formalities to be dispensed with. What that means is that we do not have to deal with the third reading on the next day.
