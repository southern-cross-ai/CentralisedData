        , I thank my colleagues for asking me to move this motion of condolence on their behalf. It is an honour to do so but an honour that I had hoped would never come my way. I knew Margaret well. I admired her very much and, despite her great age, it seems somehow impossible that she has not after all outlived us all to go on offering her wise and sometimes pointed advice to a new generation. Australia has lost one of its finest citizens. The Labor Party has lost one of its greatest and certainly its most gracious champion. Those of us who knew Margaret have lost a dear friend and her husband, Gough, and children, Tony, Nick, Stephen and Catherine, have lost a fiercely loyal and devoted wife and mother.

         Margaret Whitlam
        </a>
        was one half of one of the most extraordinary and certainly the most enduring personal and political partnerships in Australian history. This April would have marked Gough and Margaret's 70th wedding anniversary. She was always by Gough's side; she was never in his shadow. Margaret accomplished an extraordinary balancing act as a private citizen in a very public role, and she did so with such good humour and graciousness that she earned an enduring place in the hearts of the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born just after the end of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        in Bondi,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , Margaret Elaine Dovey was the daughter of Mary and Wilfred Robert 'Bill' Dovey, then a young returned serviceman and law student, later a New South Wales Supreme Court Judge. Both her parents encouraged and supported Margaret in every endeavour she undertook and she grew to be a woman who was always willing to have a go at any new experience. Later in life this would include writing a newspaper column, hosting a television show, acting as a tour guide and travelling alone across America by Greyhound bus, staying at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA" rel="nofollow">
         YMCA
        </a>
        . As a young woman, she threw herself wholeheartedly into musical and theatrical performance and athletics. She was, she later said, a bit of a show-off.
       </p>
       <p>
        It says a great deal about Margaret Whitlam's extraordinary life and exceptional contribution to Australia that representing her country as a champion athlete has become just a footnote to her subsequent achievements. The picture of the 18-year-old Margaret Dovey in her swimming costume and long braids sitting on the edge of the pool ready to swim for Australia in the 1938
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Empire Games
        </a>
        has become a familiar and iconic image. Less well known is the fact that for weeks before the Empire Games she had been suffering from a throat infection—this is in pre-penicillin days—a condition that simply had to be endured while it ran its course, and she competed against doctor's advice. Later, Margaret would say that nothing short of being strapped to a bed would have kept her from the starting blocks. Feeling so ill, she worried she would sink to the bottom of the pool mid-race. She finished last, but she turned up, she had not quit and she had given it her all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps that is why she was so well loved throughout her life by those who knew her and then by so many Australians who had never met her but who felt they knew her from her writing and her speeches. She was unmistakably someone who exemplified the idea of having a go and, having set herself to have a go, was not about to have any truck with half-measures. What Margaret Whitlam did, she did with her whole heart, with courage, with enthusiasm, without complaint and without hesitation, from setting her cap at the most gorgeous thing she had seen in her life—the young Edward Gough Whitlam—to her work as a social worker with the Family Welfare Bureau as a young wartime bride, to postwar wife and mother, and then to political engagement.
       </p>
       <p>
        It annoyed Margaret—and would continue to annoy her throughout her life—when people assumed her political views and commitment were a reflection of those of her husband. Her maternal grandfather, after all, had been a preselected Labor candidate and Margaret had cast her first vote for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Jessie Street
        </a>
        . She recounted later at her first official function as the wife of the newly minted member for Werriwa—the Coronation Dinner in 1953—a Liberal sitting opposite her asked, 'God, Margaret, what's a nice girl like you doing in the Labor Party?' She retorted, 'I belong to the party that cares about people.' She said time and time again that her views were her own: 'I say what I think when I want. I am not a mouthpiece for my husband or for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        and it is very frustrating for me when people assume that I am.' No one who knew Margaret Whitlam could have any doubt that, had the times and expectations of women's lives been different, she herself would have risen to great heights in a career of her choice. Indeed, when Gough's high-stakes gambit of crash through or crash in seeking the leadership of the federal parliamentary Labor Party in 1966 looked like it might end in his expulsion from the Labor Party, his plan was to resign from parliament so that Margaret could seek preselection as Labor candidate for Werriwa. He said to me, beaming with obvious pride when recounting the story, 'She would have won, too.' Gough's victory at the federal executive meant we never saw Margaret Whitlam MP, but her commitment and contribution to the causes she believed in and the party she had chosen was no less for being pursued outside the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps only those of us in politics can really appreciate the impact that years of preselection bids, election campaigns, parliamentary sittings, endless branch meetings and fundraisers and electorate function after function can have on a family. Perhaps only those of us in politics can appreciate just what six years on the back bench or seven years in the shadow cabinet or 25 years in parliament really meant to Gough and Margaret, both the sacrifices and the rewards. Perhaps only those of us in the party can appreciate that in Labor, where reform should be a cause, not a career choice, a unified agenda is as essential around the kitchen table as it is on the conference floor.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as running the Whitlam household largely single-handedly during Gough's absences on parliamentary and later shadow ministerial and leadership duties—a burden many political spouses shoulder and one that all of us who hold elected office are aware of—Margaret was wholeheartedly involved in the local community. She took part in the endless slog of campaigning and, in Gough's words, looked after the branches—always making sure to take her knitting in case proceedings turned tedious. She took classes in public speaking and in committee procedure. She was a delegate to, then president of, the Werriwa Federal Electorate Council of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        and a delegate to the Labor Women's Conference. As was the expectation then, she was always ready to host the booth workers and election campaigners in the Whitlam home on election night. It is little wonder that after the 1972 election, when Margaret found herself in the Lodge without children to chase or meals to cook or a paid job, she put up with sitting on her thumbs and doing nothing, as she called it, for a week and no longer.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a young woman, Margaret had been tremendously impressed by Elsie Curtin's austerity hints in the newspapers. How refreshing, she thought, to have a Prime Minister's wife who speaks out. And speak out Margaret Whitlam did. As a young married couple in Sydney's southern suburbs, the Whitlams had embodied the difficulties and opportunities of making a life for a young family at a time when wartime rationing and postwar optimism coexisted. As a prime ministerial couple in the Lodge, they came again to stand for a particular moment in Australian history, a time of social change and cultural freedom. No less than her husband, Margaret Whitlam was a public representation of a fresh, new, modern Australia. She had clear views and no fear of expressing them—views which still, 40 years later, are far from conservative. As Margaret said: 'It is absurd just because you are a politician's wife to sit around like a dummy saying nothing or echoing him. You might as well give up living.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking to the press soon after the 1972 election, she spoke frankly in favour of equal pay for women, the need for the decriminalisation of abortion, the legalisation of marijuana and her belief that marriage was not necessary unless the couple involved intended to have children. She described herself as a fellow traveller rather than an active feminist because, she said, she was too lazy to march, but she was throughout her time in the Lodge a consistent and strong advocate for women's rights. While she was careful to always point out that her views were her own and that she did not try and intrude on the policy-making of Australia's elected representatives, she did admit that from time to time she gave her husband a good thump if he got out of line. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is the privilege of a wife of my vintage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keeping Gough in line was in fact a lifelong project for Margaret. Many of us have had the experience of having a speech by Gough Whitlam enhanced by the accompaniment of Margaret Whitlam's gentle heckling from the front row—in later years, augmented by the thump of her walking-stick on the floor if she felt he was going on for too long.
       </p>
       <p>
        Very soon after Labor's election win in 1972, Margaret was offered a column in
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman's_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Woman's Day
         </a>
        </i>
        to write every week about her experiences as the Prime Minister's wife. Having rejected a job offer from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Packer" rel="nofollow">
         Frank Packer
        </a>
        on leaving school because he would not put her on the police rounds—'Our girls only do social rounds,' he told her—Margaret leapt at the chance to write for
        <i>
         Woman's Day
        </i>
        . It was her opportunity to share the extraordinary experiences of her life with people who would never have the chance to know of them firsthand. She wrote about the day-to-day realities of life in the Lodge and about the day-to-day absurdities of life in the political spotlight. When she travelled overseas with Gough, she took her readers with her through her columns—to China, to Tokyo, to Rome; even to dinner with the Queen in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle" rel="nofollow">
         Windsor Castle
        </a>
        . Some felt it was improper of the Prime Minister's wife to demystify not only her own life but the life of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_England" rel="nofollow">
         Queen of England
        </a>
        , but Margaret was unmoved by criticism. She responded:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I came to represent all the ungainly people, the too-tall ones, the too-fat ones and the housebound as I'd been, who'd never go to China or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace" rel="nofollow">
         Buckingham Palace
        </a>
        and went through me.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1975, she was a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Advisory Committee
        </a>
        for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Year" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Year
        </a>
        , a position she was at first reluctant to accept because she felt it had been offered only due to her position and because she worried that the other women involved would think that she was insufficiently militant. She soon became a respected and integral part of the committee, not as the Prime Minister's wife but as Margaret Whitlam, a woman of great good sense, great good humour and absolutely no pretension.
       </p>
       <p>
        Margaret weathered the political storms of the Whitlam government with great equanimity, refusing to be swayed from what she thought was right. Nor was she meek in the face of media hostility. I must say, Margaret was never in her life meek in the face of anything, as the Australian press found out. When considering them to have misrepresented a comment she made on the subject of inflation, she used a public speech to declare that the press is 'an ass', 'vultures', 'praying mantises', 'uninvited guests' and 'intruders'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of the tributes published over the past few days have mentioned Margaret's response to the dismissal, saying that, instead of accepting the note withdrawing his commission, Gough, 'silly old man', 'should have torn it up'.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Fraser" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Fraser
        </a>
        was lucky it was Mr, not Mrs, Whitlam meeting with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General" rel="nofollow">
         Governor General
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerr" rel="nofollow">
         John Kerr
        </a>
        was luckier. The unreported rest of that sentence goes: 'and then slapped his'—that is, Kerr's—'face and told him to pull himself together.'
       </p>
       <p>
        During that tumultuous election campaign, the two years of opposition that followed and then Whitlam's final election campaign in 1977, Margaret was an absolute tower of strength for Gough but also for many others in the ALP. Although she had as much, and more, reason to be as devastated by the events as anyone, feeling sorry for herself was never Margaret's style. Margaret's glass was never half empty; it was always half full, preferably with red wine!
       </p>
       <p>
        After Gough's parliamentary career ended, for Margaret life as a truly private citizen, rather than in the unelected public role of a politician's wife, brought her more time to devote to her love of the arts in all its forms—music, drama, dance, painting and sculpture—and travel. She was a regular at concerts by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Symphony_Orchestra" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Symphony Orchestra
        </a>
        and visiting orchestras such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Philharmonic" rel="nofollow">
         Berlin Philharmonic
        </a>
        . She described hearing the Berlin Philharmonic as a 'transcendental experience'. She was an enthusiast for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Opera Australia
        </a>
        and had fine aesthetic judgment. She spoke often about the importance of exposing young people to high culture, which could ignite creativity in them. When Margaret lived in Paris during Gough's term as ambassador to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">
         UNESCO
        </a>
        , she devoted much time to the Louvre and many other major museums and the Gothic cathedrals. She was particularly excited by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance" rel="nofollow">
         Italian Renaissance
        </a>
        painting. For more than a decade Margaret was a director of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP" rel="nofollow">
         ISP
        </a>
        —International Study Programs. With Gough, she led 16 tours to Spain and Portugal, Greece and Turkey,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" rel="nofollow">
         South America
        </a>
        , Russia, Italy, Germany, Indonesia and Britain. Both Gough and Margaret also visited scores of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage
        </a>
        sites and were strong advocates for their preservation. Among her many roles, Margaret served as a director of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Dance_Company" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Dance Company
        </a>
        , as President of the Australian Capital Territory Council of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Social Service

       </p>
       <p>
        Gough and Margaret both possessed a wonderful sense of humour, albeit at times mysterious to those not in on the joke.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Barry Jones
        </a>
        reminds me that in 2004 Gough and Margaret attended a production in Sydney of August Strindberg's play
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dance" rel="nofollow">
          The Dance
         </a>
         of Death
        </i>
        , starring
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Ian_McKellen" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Ian McKellen
        </a>
        as Edgar and Frances de la Tour as his tormented wife, Alice. Some weeks later, as Chairman of the Port Arthur Historic Site, Barry arranged for them to visit and to be driven around in the site's people mover. Gough sat in the front with the driver and Barry sat behind with Margaret. Without looking behind, Gough boomed, 'Is Alice on board?' 'I'm here, Edgar,' she responded in a voice of doom. Their shared political commitments and cultural interests—except for Margaret's love of
        <i>
         The Bill
        </i>
        continued to provide a rich and full life for both.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although their private jokes could be impenetrable to outsiders, their devotion to each other was evident to all. As the infirmities of age encroached, they would each compete to be of service to the other—'I'll do that.' 'No, let me get it.' 'No, let me do that for you.'—much to the exasperation of friends and family because, as one observed, 'Neither of them is hugely mobile!' Even as health troubles curtailed and then ended Margaret's travels she continued to give generously, unstintingly of her time, particularly to the Australian Labor Party. She was not just an inspiration but also a constant encouragement to generations of ALP members and supporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remember her coming to a speech I gave last year. The venue required her to walk quite a long way, which was extremely ardu­ous for her. When I thanked her for the effort she expended to get there she waved it away, saying simply, 'I wanted to be here.' When others might have become discour­aged or disillusioned, or simply felt that they had given enough of themselves, their time and their energy, Margaret, like Gough, remained indefatigable, irrepressible and unflagging. She gave much and, as always, she never expected anything in return. Margaret was always appreciative and grateful for any kindness or courtesy she or, as she often referred to Gough, 'the old boy', received. I do not think she ever for a moment in her life felt that she was due anything, either for her position or for her efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2007 the Australian Labor Party recognised her contribution with national life membership. It was the second national life membership ever issued. The first had been given mere seconds before to the man beside her; her companion through everything, Edward Gough Whitlam. It was as impossible then as it is unbearable now to imagine them apart.

        While we are all in mourning for Margaret, for the passionate, irreverent, generous woman who touched the lives of everyone who knew her and of very many who did not, we know our sorrow is only a shadow of the grief felt by those closest to her. Our deepest sympathies go out to Gough, whom I spoke to just a few minutes ago, and to Margaret and Gough's children, Tony, Nick, Stephen and Catherine. Nothing we can say here will ease the burden of their loss, but I hope they can find some comfort in knowing how deeply loved and widely admired Margaret was. She was quite simply a wonderful human being and a great, great Australian.

         I rise on behalf of the coalition to support the motion moved by Senator Faulkner and to offer my own and the coalition's condolences to the entire Whitlam firmly, and to the many friends of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
          Margaret Whitlam
         </a>
         , following the death of Margaret Whitlam AO last weekend. I acknowledge the eloquence and heartfelt words of Senator Faulkner in the stories and recollections that he gave to the chamber today. I think the intimacy that was revealed in Senator Faulkner's words, and the importance that we all know Margaret Whitlam had not only in Senator Faulkner's life but also in the lives of many of those opposite, is very much felt by us here this afternoon. I sincerely acknowledge those remarks.
        </p>
        <p>
         She was a woman passionate in her pursuit of social causes and in her advocacy for those less fortunate, for those interested in education and for those with an engagement in the arts. I saw Margaret Whitlam over the decades as a prominent Australian woman. In making these observations this afternoon on behalf of the coalition I acknowledge her first in that capacity and then in her capacity as the wife of an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Prime Minister
         </a>
         , for I believe that is how many, if not most, people saw her. As the wife of a Prime Minister, she was enthusiastic. She was energetic and—I believe well described as, not in a critical sense but in a simple observation of her approach—outspoken. She was a devoted mother and a devoted community worker. In her own right she was a frequent guest speaker, a broadcaster and a columnist, as we have heard today. The insights that she provided, not just into life in the Lodge but into life as the wife of our Prime Minister and the many travels that they took and the things that they saw, were, as I understand it, devoured by her devoted readers.
        </p>
        <p>
         She was a passionate advocate of the rights of all women and of Australian women in particular. I know, as Senator Faulkner acknowledged, her service on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Year" rel="nofollow">
          International Women's Year
         </a>
         advisory committee marked a very important step in her participation in those particular matters at a more public level in Australian society. As an active member of the Labor Women's Conference, I am sure that she became a mentor to many of those engaged in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         . I suspect that I do not even need to ask, because I would not be able to count them if I tried.
        </p>
        <p>
         Her accompanying of the Prime Minister on his extensive travels—those first trips to places that she had not visited before, like China and Japan, India and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" rel="nofollow">
          North America
         </a>
         and Europe—were the stuff of folklore, through her writing of them in her column on many occasions. Her hosting of official events at the Lodge was highly admired by those who attended.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think Senator Faulkner did not acknowledge her participation as a panellist in the then popular television program Beauty and the Beast for some years leading up to the 1972 election, when her husband became Prime Minister. Beauty and the Beast saw, I suspect, more than its fair share of political participants of one colour or another, but that was another of her many firsts.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said, the insights that she gave to readers really opened up the character of the leading family of Australia over many years. It was her pursuit of social causes and it was her advocacy of education and the arts which very much marked her participation in those areas of the Australian community. It was not until I actually began to read the list this morning that I realised quite how prolific that contribution had been—and not from someone who had nothing else to do, by the way. The

Unsurprisingly, in 1983 Margaret Whitlam received the Order of Australia for her tireless work in the community.
        </p>
        <p>
         As Senator Faulkner has also mentioned, I—and I am sure many others in the chamber and other Australians—will never forget those evocative photographs of her in her
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Empire Games
         </a>
         swimming costume, ready to compete for Australia. The pictures at Bondi in particular say so much about women in Australian sport, as well as all of her other contributions.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that she engaged with the community in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         , most particularly through the federal seat of Werriwa, in a way that probably had not been done before and will remain most firmly held in the minds of many of those who met her over those years.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of the obituaries written in the last few days, all of the contributions in the Australian media, note her sense of humour. I suspect that you cannot live with Gough Whitlam for 70 years without having a fairly well developed sense of humour. I make that observation as a distant observer, but I suspect it stood her in very good stead. In the way of Sydney events, now and then once I entered the political sphere I would see her and Mr Whitlam at a number of events. It is not often I am the short girl in the room, but on those occasions beside Mrs Whitlam I most often was.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some years ago for some time I participated actively in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Republican_Movement" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Republican Movement
         </a>
         —much to the concern of many on this side of the chamber, I know, but they seem on most days to have gotten over it. I remember vividly—and I cannot recall whether or not Senator Faulkner was there—a group photograph being taken of the Australian Republican Movement on the steps of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_House" rel="nofollow">
          Opera House
         </a>
         . It must have been more than 10 years ago now. Both Margaret and Mr Whitlam were in attendance to commemorate with this photograph. It may have even been for the year 2000. We were all to be in serried ranks up the stairs of the Australian Opera House. Given that it was only about 10 or so years ago, age was already having its impact on their capacity to stand for a long time, particularly to stand on those extremely narrow Opera House stairs. So Mrs Whitlam turned around to see who she could find and she said: 'Senator, you're tall. You'll do. Come here.' So, under instruction, I moved up the few rows of stairs and stood between them as an anchor so that they did not fall down the stairs. Heaven only knows what would have happened if one of them had tilted just slightly one way or the other. But it is a very pleasant memory for me, and I always was glad that she was able to put aside political proclivities to allow me to be their anchor on that particular day.
        </p>
        <p>
         To Mr Whitlam, to their children, Tony, Nick, Stephen and Catherine, on behalf of the coalition we extend our deepest condolences. It is an honour for me this afternoon to have the opportunity to acknowledge the life of Mrs Margaret Whitlam, AO on behalf of the coalition.

          I also wish to endorse the condolences of this whole chamber to Gough Whitlam, his four children and the extended family and friends of

          from the Senate. I did but meet Margaret Whitlam a couple of times in my life, and they were both pleasant. I recognised a formidable, intelligent but engaging character. My experience was the same as that of Senator Payne's: she was very friendly and a person who was able to engage without the restriction of a political label, as you sometimes run into. Following on from Senator Faulkner's very fitting eulogy to this woman, Margaret Whitlam, who he has aptly described as a great Australian, and the comments about the time Gough was the representative on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">

          —which has since led to the proclamation of such wonderful attributes in this country as the

           Franklin River
          </a>
          and the south-west wilderness area. I can only but acknowledge the role of both the Whitlams in the saving of this very special place on the face of the planet, as far as we Tasmanian environmentalists are concerned.
         </p>
         <p>
          I cannot do anything that would add to that wonderful eulogy from Senator Faulkner. Near the end he described Margaret Whitlam as a passionate, irreverent and generous Australian. I think that sums her up. I might add to that the words of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germaine_Greer" rel="nofollow">
           Germaine Greer
          </a>
          , whose writing—not least,

          </i>
          influenced Margaret Whitlam and through her the Whitlam government. This is one of the great modernising governments in Australian history. Germaine Greer described Margaret Whitlam as: 'an oasis of light, peace and common sense.' That indeed she was. A great Australian. Our condolences to Gough and the Whitlam family. Australia has lost a sterling citizen.
