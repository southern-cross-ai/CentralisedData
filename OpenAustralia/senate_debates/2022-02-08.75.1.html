         I thank Senator Chandler for her question and for her enduring commitment to women's economic security, which reflects the enduring commitment of the Morrison government. In fact, the Morrison government's economic plan is clearly working. Today there are over one million more women in work than when we came to government. Let me say that again: today there are over one million more women in work under a coalition Liberal-National government. This is not something that happens by accident. It can only have been made possible because of the economic policies that have been put in place, intentionally, by this government. We currently have the highest women's employment-to-population ratio Australia has ever seen—more Australian women in work than ever before. Women's workforce participation is hovering at record levels and women's underemployment is steadily heading consistently down. All of this has been achieved with the background of a global pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, there are more opportunities for Australian women to work, to take up an apprenticeship, to upskill, to reskill, to start a business and to take on those better and higher-paying jobs than ever before. Our government's commitment to enhancing the economic security of Australian women extends well beyond economic management. In the 2020-21 budget, we made a landmark commitment and investment of $1.9 billion to improve the affordability of child care by increasing the child care subsidy for families with multiple children. For women who want to return to the workforce, to take on training, to study or to volunteer, the decision to take on the cost of child care is made more affordable.
        </p>
        <p>
         But improving women's economic security is only part of the goal. On top of our economic—

            Yes, I can. Let's be clear: from skills to child care, from leadership to board appointments and, most importantly, job opportunities, we are backing Australian women to get the choices and chances that they deserve, that we deserve. Australian women can rest assured that this government's economic plan will maximise opportunities as we continue to recover from the pandemic. I can certainly promise you,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

            , that we won't be slugging them with higher taxes. We won't be proposing a retiree tax, for instance, damaging their retirement savings. We certainly won't be bringing in $387 billion of new or higher taxes, smashing their jobs and robbing women of opportunities. While the child care subsidy is currently up to 95 per cent for those families with two or more children who want to work, study or volunteer, we certainly won't be bringing in free child care for millionaires while regular women work longer hours to pay the taxes to pay for such a scheme.

               The Morrison government recognises that improving measures like the gender pay gap requires a commitment and a targeted policy and a partnership between industry and between government, between the private sector and all levels of government. But before I talk about what's ahead let's talk about what's in the rear-view mirror. There was a 17.4 per cent gender pay gap when we came to office; now it's 14.2 per cent.
              </p>
              <p>
               But there's more to do; there's no doubt about that. As a government, we believe in policies that actually shift the dial—policies not put in place for show, like your policy to give millionaires free child care, but policies with genuine substance. That's why the Women's Budget Statement this year committed to a full review of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency to determine how government can further work alongside the private sector to collectively close the gender pay gap. The Gender Equality Act requires that employers with more than 100 employees report to the—
