        My question is to Senator Cash, representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Minister, I refer you to the humanitarian calamity your government has created on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Manus Island
        </a>
        . After cutting off drinking water, food, medicine and electricity, your detainees were violently forced out of the detention centre by being beaten with metal bars last week. This is despite the fact that your so-called alternative accommodation is not ready and, even if it was, would not be safe or appropriate. Minister, why does your government continue to claim that all of the alternative accommodation facilities are ready when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
         UNHCR
        </a>
        and many others have made it abundantly clear they are not finished, they are not finished today and, even if they were finished, they would be totally unsafe and inappropriate?

          McKim
         </a>
         , yet again you and I are going to have to agree to disagree. I fundamentally reject the premise of all of Senator McKim's questions. But I also would make the point that, Senator McKim, you have stood here proudly today and stated that you have been to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Manus Island
         </a>
         now four times. Four times you went up there and you encouraged the residents not to comply with the directions given by either an Australian government or the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG
         </a>
         government. You go up there quite deliberately but quite proudly, as you say, to enflame tensions in relation to this matter. You go up there quite proudly again, as you have stated, to give the residents false hope that they may come to Australia. Senator McKim, like so many activists, you have encouraged the residents to stay in a centre where there was no food, no electricity and no water just so that you could make a political point.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm not going to make a political point; I am going to put facts on the table as to why the government will not waver when it comes to border protection. Senator McKim, you were unfortunately but in your political party quite proudly associated with the former Labor government that did lose control of our borders. Because of that, in excess of 50,000 people arrived here illegally by boat, and we are still dealing with that issue. But, in particular, Senator McKim, the policies that you supported meant that 1,200 people died at sea trying to make the journey to this country.

                  Yes, that's technically correct. That is a second point of order from Senator Bernardi. On the first matter, I will allow the minister to answer those parts of the question. I will reflect exactly what was recorded. I was trying to take notes on the language but I didn't get every word and, if appropriate, I will bring that back to the chamber. I call Senator Cash to answer the parts of the question that were asked before the clock ran out. Senator Cash.
