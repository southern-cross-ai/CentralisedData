        I wish to draw the attention of the chamber to a significant event held each year in Tasmania at Quercus Park in Carrick, known as Agfest. Proud, passionate and hardworking Rural Youth volunteers have been organising this event for nearly 40 years. The first Agfest event was held in 1983, attracting 111 exhibitors and 9,000 patrons. But now, recognised as one of the top three agricultural field days held in Australia, Agfest hosts more than 700 exhibitors and 60,000 attendees each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This event is run by a volunteer committee of 50 Rural Youth members and former members, with an average age of just 24. The skills they develop by participating in Rural Youth and as part of the Agfest committee are incredible. They're reflected in the strong leadership, organisational and stakeholder-engagement skills shown on site each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Exhibitors from the agricultural sector and support sectors travel from across Tasmania and mainland Australia to display their products and services at Agfest, and they are well supported by Tasmanians, who flock to the site. Agfest is usually held at the Carrick site across four days in May each year. The Agfest committee pivoted during the COVID-19 pandemic and introduced an Agfest in the Cloud version of the event. That initiative was well supported, with over one million page views in 2020 and 110,000 in 2021.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year, the 2022 event was deferred from its May date due to COVID restrictions. Agfest in the paddock for 2022 will now be held from 24 to 27 August, with an additional week of Agfest in the Cloud from 27 August. Rural Youth volunteers are already planning their events for 2023, which will return again to the early May schedule. I encourage any senators who have an interest in agricultural shows to make their way to Tasmania during Agfest and experience Agfest for yourselves.
