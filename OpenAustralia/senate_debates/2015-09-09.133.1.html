        <i>

         Mr President
        </a>
        , today I present
        <i>
         Report 151
        </i>
        for the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, Report 151 deals with the
        <i>
         Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of India on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Energy" rel="nofollow">
          Nuclear Energy
         </a>
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Agreement" rel="nofollow">
         The Agreement
        </a>
        offers the potential for Australia to become one of the world leaders in supplying fuel for low-carbon emission electrical power in expanding economies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While there are considerable benefits for Australia and India, the Agreement is not without risk.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        has taken the time to consider those risks carefully, and has made a number of recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But first, Mr President, I will discuss the benefits. The Agreement has the potential to double the size of the Australian uranium mining industry, adding $1.75bn to the Australian economy and doubling employment in uranium mining and export.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These benefits will occur mostly in rural and regional areas of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For India, the Agreement will help with the goal of growing electricity generation from a base of 408kWh per capita per year in 2001 to 5,300kWh per capita per year in 2052.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will also provide a reliable supply of fuel, which is important to India's energy security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, India is one of a small number of nuclear armed countries that have not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is a barrier to nuclear cooperation, as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPT" rel="nofollow">
         NPT
        </a>
        has effectively limited nuclear proliferation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, given India's strategic situation, it is not realistic to expect India to dismantle its nuclear arsenal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Agreement represents a new, and not uncontroversial, approach to non-proliferation - treating India as if it were a party to the NPT. That is, India can obtain uranium if it meets the nuclear safety and security standards expected of other nuclear armed states.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the Committee heard in evidence that many NPT countries object to this new approach.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the new approach is going to work, India needs to make concrete non-proliferation advances to calm the fears of NPT countries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To that end, the Committee recommends that Australia commit significant diplomatic resources to encouraging India to become a party to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Test_Ban_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
         Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
        </a>
        and to negotiate a fissile material cut-off treaty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee also recommends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        consider facilitating the negotiation of a nuclear arms limitation treaty for the Indian subcontinent region.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the Committee is concerned about flaws in India's nuclear regulatory arrangements identified by the Indian Auditor General and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">
         International Atomic Energy Agency
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The regulatory flaws are enough of a concern to the Committee for it to recommend that no Australian nuclear fuel be sold to India until they are addressed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the Committee also examined a number of concerns with the Agreement itself.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many inquiry participants are concerned that Australian nuclear material in India may not be properly accounted for.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The accounting mechanisms for exported Australian nuclear materials are part of confidential Administrative Arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To ensure proper accounting of Australian nuclear material in India, the Committee held a private briefing with the Director-General of the Australian Safety and Non-Proliferation Office to discuss the matter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Director" rel="nofollow">
         The Director
        </a>
        -General was able to say that the Administrative Arrangement negotiated with India would allow him to report the disposition of Australian nuclear material in India, as required by the
        <i>
         Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act of 1987
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Based on this advice, the Committee trusts that Australian nuclear material can be tracked and accounted for.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, experienced legal practitioners who participated in the inquiry appear to have differing interpretations of a couple of aspects of the Agreement, leaving the Committee unable to determine which interpretation was correct.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee has recommended in each case that the Australian Government outline the legal advice it has received.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, having regard to these recommendations, the Committee considers that binding treaty action can be taken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, I would like to thank the Australian Government for its patience while the Committee undertook the inquiry, and I would also like to thank the engaged and experienced participants to this inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the Report to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
