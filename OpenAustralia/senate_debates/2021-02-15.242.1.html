        Liberal Party state council selected the four candidates that will be represented on our ticket at the next federal election. The two women and two men on our ticket, in addition to their respective careers spanning agriculture, small business, resources, communications, law, economics, military and health, just to name a few, understand what's important to everyday South Australians. They are a diverse team that was greatly advanced by the selection of my very good friend Indigenous woman Kerrynne Liddle—

          parliament, where he was president of the legislative council for a number of years, before he graduated to become a member of this august body, the Senate—Kerrynne and Rachel give us an amazing diversity, youth and experience, balanced against what must be the most extraordinary depth of life experience that they all are able to bring to this place.
         </p>
         <p>
          Kerrynne, as a proud Arrernte woman, has seen firsthand the disadvantage in our remote communities and is comfortable with calling out paternalism and the hypocrisy that promotes low expectations. She still has the red dirt from country Australia underneath her fingernails and has a track record of delivering outcomes. She can break a brumby, she can mules a sheep, she can scrub up to present the evening news on Channel 7 or the ABC and she can negotiate multimillion dollar deals behind land agreements.

           The Liberal Party

          is a party of equal opportunity, and our Senate candidates harness the diverse experiences and business backgrounds that make that possible. We believe in the encouragement of the facilitation of wealth so that all may enjoy the highest possible standards of living, health, education and social justice. Each and every one of our candidates wants the next generation to be better placed to succeed in their lives than in their own. Our party is comprised of Australians from all walks and at all stages of life. Fighting for South Australia requires individuals who are prepared to stand up to our bigger state cousins and prepared to stand up for the investment our state needs, sometimes against a national trend.
         </p>
         <p>
          A diversity of experience, an insight into both the public and the private sectors and a backgrounded knowledge and business acumen are critical to the role of senators.

            With real-world experience, the South Australia Senate ticket is a strong team who will advance South Australia's interests at the next federal election. They share a vision for South Australia, one where we can attract more investment to ensure that the jobs stay in our state, both in Adelaide and across all of our regions, to help keep our children working and living in South Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is absolutely critical we put the right team in place to ensure strong representation for South Australia in Canberra and to campaign effectively for the re-election of a Morrison-

             McCormack

            government, which is so essential to ensure the stability of Australia's economy, going forward. I look forward to working with

             Simon Birmingham

            , with Andrew McLachlan, with Kerrynne, with Rachael Swift, with

             David Fawcett
            </a>
            and with Alex Antic to make sure that we do re-elect a Morrison-McCormack government because we know that Australia relies on us to deliver the right government to make sure that our society and our economy go forward in leaps and bounds, and we will work tirelessly to make sure that we secure the greatest number of Liberals to represent our state.
           </p>
           <p>
            In closing, I'd also like to acknowledge two outstanding young women who were preselected on the weekend to take up, hopefully, their seats in the state parliament at the next election in South Australia. Ashton Hurn, who was preselected in the seat of Schubert and who has worked for me, I am very proud to say, is the most outstanding a young woman and will make an incredible contribution to South Australia.

She will make sure she supports the continuation of a Liberal government in South Australia to make sure your team don't get their hands on the treasury benches and cause the kind of devastation they did last time they had control.

I'm very proud to be here tonight to tell you about the amazing people that the South Australian Liberal Party is putting in our parliaments both here in Canberra and in South Australia—
