       <p>
        [by video link] What we just saw was more apologies from the National Party for the utter failures of this Prime Minister. In regional

        , the vaccine rollout, despite what the Prime Minister says, lags well behind the cities. And you know what? The Australian rollout lags well behind the rest of the developed world. Do you know what would fix border closures and lockdowns? A proper vaccine rollout would fix them. We have a Prime Minister who has utterly failed Australians, with a botched vaccine rollout and a failed national quarantine system. The government has been undermining the states at every turn, including by again threatening today to take the

        . This Prime Minister is more Billy McMahon than even Billy McMahon himself was. He is more marketing than man. He is fundamentally not up to the great national task that confronts this parliament: vaccinating Australia, keeping Australians safe and actually delivering on the national interest, a concept that this Prime Minister is fundamentally incapable of understanding. His complacency, his vanity, his refusal to take responsibility and his complete incapacity to distinguish between the national interest and his own narrow political interest have let Australia and Australians down, and the sooner he is in the rear-vision mirror the better.
