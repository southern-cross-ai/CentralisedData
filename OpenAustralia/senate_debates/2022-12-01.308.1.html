        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I refer to the release of ministerial diaries by the Attorney-General and the Treasurer detailing their first 100 days in office. The Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, has said, 'I'm going to continue to work with colleagues and across the Public Service on making sure that there is as much transparency as possible about our government information and ministerial diaries.' Minister, given the commitment of the Attorney-General to create 'as much transparency as possible about ministerial diaries', why is the Prime Minister refusing to release his diary, putting him at odds with his own Attorney-General and Treasurer?

         I assume these are

         claims or requests, not one of the many orders for production that seem to be occurring at the moment. Obviously, every freedom-of-information request is distinct and has to be considered on its merits, and every minister will have to respond to requests in a manner that is appropriate to those individual circumstances. I'm not the FOI decision-maker, but I know that FOI decision-makers obviously will have to make a judgement on the basis of the merits of the application before them.

              applications for ministerial diaries remain outstanding for some other ministers, including herself?

               Here we go againâ€”Senator Birmingham's new-found interest in transparency! I bet you didn't release yours, did you, mate? You didn't release yours, and nor did anyone release the ministerial list that showed the secret ministries that the Morrison government was engaged in, nor did anyone release the details of Senator McKenzie using spreadsheets to allocate government moneys, nor did anyone release how it is that you funded car parks which people didn't want. So the Australian people, I think, will look at you and your questions, as a former member of the leadership group who helped cover up all of this, and they will look with a very clear eye at the hypocrisy on the other side of the table.
