        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. Yesterday the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
         ASC
        </a>
        informed its workforce that a further 56 blue-collar jobs will be lost to the shipyard at Osborne, bringing the number of workers sacked this year to 372. Just this month, Prime Minister Morrison boasted, 'Our defence industry plan is delivering.' How is the defence industry plan delivering for the 372 workers and their families who have lost their jobs since Christmas last?

          I thank Senator Carr for his question. Most certainly, the issue of job losses in any industry, in any business, is always a matter of concern to government and to industry as well. The workers at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
           ASC
          </a>
          have been doing a significantly important job, particularly in the construction of the air warfare destroyers and the delivery of those vessels. They have been doing that job based on the last orders which were placed for vessels into the ASC shipyard which, of course, were placed by a coalition government.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the six years in which those opposite were in the position of government in this country, they did not commission one single naval vessel. This government is commissioning 54 naval vessels from shipyards in Australia, focused on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          —the shipyard to which Senator Carr referred—and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          . If that had not been done, then perhaps Senator Carr could take issue with this government's approach to policy in this matter. However, his approach and the approach of the government of which he was a member—he was the minister for industry, if I recall correctly—was that no work was done in this area whatsoever. In fact, it is known appropriately as Labor's valley of death. It was directed by them; it was authored by them; it was written by them. This government has turned it around, this government has turned around Australia's naval capability and this government will deliver.

            If the government has turned it around, why are you still laying people off? Given the government's continued failure to meet its own targets in the Naval Shipbuilding Plan, will the minister now ensure that the

             I would have hoped during the period of time in which Senator Carr held responsible for an industry portfolio that he understood the process that is required for naval shipbuilding, but, no. I actually know why he doesn't understand it. It's because they had no experience at it whatever.

            <p>
             Let me tell you what this government has done to support jobs in a number of ways that go beyond the investment that I've already talked about. We have a targeted retention strategy, which is creating up to 200 positions within
