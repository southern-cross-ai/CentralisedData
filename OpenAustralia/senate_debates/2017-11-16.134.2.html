        by leave—This morning we awoke to the news that an Australian diplomat by the name of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Simpson" rel="nofollow">
         Julian Simpson
        </a>
        had tragically died in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        . He was a second secretary to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        , and I want to put on the record that I came to know Julian last year when on secondment to the United Nations with Senator Lisa Singh. Senator Singh and I were babysat—that's how I termed it; I'm sure that's not the official term, but it might be how the diplomats regard it. He showed us through the intricacies of the United Nations system. He introduced us to the best coffee places in New York and showed us how to access the subway and was our chaperone and our confidant. He was a thorough professional. He was a credit not only to the Australian diplomatic service but to his family and his wife. He's taken too soon at 30 years of age. It is a tragedy. I wanted to put that on the record because, even though we only came into his orbit for a brief period of time, he left a lasting legacy. To receive the news today is just devastating for those who knew him. My condolences, and I'm sure those of Senator Singh, go to his wife and his family. Julian had a love of the country. He used to enjoy going to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park" rel="nofollow">

        and gazing upon the trees where he couldn't see any buildings, and it took him back to his rural roots. I'm sure he's gazing at the trees somewhere and looking down at us. Vale.

         by leave—I was also very saddened to hear this morning the news of the passing of Australia's diplomat

          Julian Simpson
         </a>
         , and I would like to, firstly, thank Senator Bernardi for calling me so early this morning to let me know of the sad news. With Senator Bernardi, I also had the privilege of working with Julian at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         for three months last year. His particular role at the Australian mission was to guide us and to help us through the complexities of the UN, and he did that with generosity, with kindness and with no level of detail left out. I think that so many people today at the UN and at the Australian mission, and his family and friends, must be really suffering and mourning his loss. It is a life lost too soon. He was a fine, intelligent young diplomat. We were very well looked after by Julian and very much made to feel like we were part of the mission family, and it is such a tragedy that Australia has lost such a fine young man, a fine young diplomat. We couldn't have had—and I'm sure Senator Bernardi agrees—a better person to be our diplomatic support while we were at the UN. I pass on my sincere condolences to his family, to his wife and to his friends and the staff at the mission.

           add my condolences to the family of the late Mr Simpson. The accident in which he was killed overnight was just one of those random events of life that can afflict people out of the blue. I was not acquainted with the gentleman concerned, but I know my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning had some very heartfelt things to say about him. He was a young man. It was a life full of promise tragically lost too soon. On behalf of the government I want to associate myself with the remarks of those who knew the gentleman concerned, and on behalf of the government I offer my condolences to his loved ones.
