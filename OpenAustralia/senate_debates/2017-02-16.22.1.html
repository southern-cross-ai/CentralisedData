           The motion, as noted by you, said that I was one of the signatories. I originally was, but I have asked for my name to be removed as a signatory. I also noticed we had another motion, moved by the Labor Party, on exactly the same issue. I did not want to be caught in the crossfire between these two competing motions. It is a very important issue; white spot virus in prawns is a very significant issue. It should not be being played as a political football by having two competing motions.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           are happy to support both motions, but we want the government and the Labor Party to get together and sort out the best way forward for this. Regardless we will have an inquiry and the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee will sort out the terms of reference, but it is ridiculous that we have got this being played as a political thing here in the chamber today.

               I also indicate that at the time that I agreed to sponsor Senator O'Sullivan's motion, I was not aware that Senator Sterle had something similar coming. I think both of them have merit. I am happy for my name to remain associated with Senator O'Sullivan's motion, but I also indicate that I hope that Senator Sterle's motion also succeeds and that the committee can basically deal with both motions.

                   There is a superior alternative motion before the Senate that we have just dealt with. The other motion proposes a comprehensive inquiry into biosecurity measures related to the control of white spot virus, the control of its outbreak in farm prawns in the area of the Logan and Albert Rivers and the implications of that outbreak. Biosecurity is a shared responsibility between the Commonwealth, the states and territories, industry and the community. The Queensland government, through Biosecurity Queensland, is the lead agency in managing the outbreak response.

                   has supported Queensland's response effort by seeking to exclude from the inquiry considerations of the response and resourcing by the Queensland government. This proposed reference would critically constrict the investigation of the committee into this important issue.

                    The question is that motion No. 4 as put by Senator Urquhart be agreed to.
