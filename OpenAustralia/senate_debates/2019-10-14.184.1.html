         I won't hold the Senate up for long on this, but considering we do have a number of senators in here who haven't been in to listen to the debate, I just want to warn them again that we are walking down the road to a police state and a surveillance state in this country. We are giving our security agencies, including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         , powers they don't need, powers they haven't made a case for.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has repeatedly failed to make a case for this legislation. The terrorism threat level in this country is unchanged for many years. I actually think we've had two elections since the terrorism threat level changed in this country. I asked repeatedly in Senate estimates in the past whether the department, including the AFP, had evidence that airports were increasing in their threat profile at any greater rate than any other infrastructure around the country. There was no evidence provided.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, senators, you are collectively walking this country down the road to a police state. This will join the well over 200 pieces of legislation in the last 20 years that have taken away the fundamental rights and freedoms we used to send people overseas to fight and die to protect and enhanceâ€”including members of my family. You are now giving these powers away willy-nilly with no rationale and no argument. This is a sad day. It is a dangerous day for this country. The
