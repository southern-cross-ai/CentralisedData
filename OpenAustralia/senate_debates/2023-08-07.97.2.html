        It is wonderful to have the shadow minister for education, my colleague Senator Sarah Henderson, over in

        during the winter break. We spent some time visiting local primary schools in my home state that are pursuing and achieving outstanding academic results and having a real impact in their communities. One of these schools is one that is extremely close to my heart. I've been a supporter and advocate of this school since long before I came here to parliamentâ€”that is, Challis
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Community Primary School
        </a>
        . Challis Community Primary School has been led by its formidable principal, Lee Musumeci, for two decades, and, thanks to her dedication, along with that of her staff, the children in the local community are flourishing. Located in Armadale in Perth's south-eastern suburbs, they are chasing what they call 'better than postcode' results and are actually achieving them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Challis way means starting from birth with a strong focus on explicit teaching so that students learn concepts in the most effective way. They are able move what they learn in the short term to long-term memory so they can recall, recite and apply what they have learned. This is all translating into phenomenal results. By developing a platform of excellence in explicit teaching, behaviour support and working together with the local community to improve student outcomes, they are closing the education gap that exists based on the community's socioeconomic status.
       </p>
       <p>
        So thank you, Lee, and your wonderful staff for having Senator Henderson and I at your school to see an excellent example of what you can do when you co-locate services and programs to deliver important outcomes for the community. They are doing a wonderful job in their community and I thank them very much indeed.
