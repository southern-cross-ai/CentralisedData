        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. Given Ms Higgins has released the minister from any privacy concerns will the minister now answer the question she was asked yesterday? At any time did the minister disclose to any other minister that her former staff member Ms Higgins had made allegations that she was raped in the minister's office? If yes, which ministers and when?

            As I have affirmed in this place, I did not advise the Prime Minister because it was not my place to do so. I also did not advise Senator Cash at any time because, again, it was not my agency to do so. I had a discussion with the

                    . It's not remotely relevant for the minister to explain why she'd prefer not to answer a question.

                     If the minister is addressing the question and providing reasoning for her answer and I believe that relates to the terms of the question I don't believe I can rule that out as not being directly relevant. You've reminded the minister of the question but I can't instruct the minister how to answer a question. I call the minister to continue.
