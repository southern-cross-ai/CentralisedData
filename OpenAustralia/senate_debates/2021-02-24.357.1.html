         I thank my friend and colleague Senator Canavan for the question. A gas-fired recovery is a key part of the government's JobMaker plan and it is central to a strong Australia as we recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Australia's competitive advantage has always been based on cheap energy, and gas will be central to our ongoing economic recovery. We want to see Australian gas working for all Australians, especially in our regions, and we're taking action to deliver more Australian gas to where it is needed at the right price. This will be delivered through a comprehensive plan of 13 measures that will establish an open competitive hub model, like the

        </p>
        <p>
         The three key action areas are unlocking supply, efficient transportation and empowering consumers. We're progressing a range of regulatory reforms and assessing what critical national gas infrastructure is needed to create a competitive gas market that will drive down prices. We're investing $220 million to support development in the Beetaloo Basin. We've ensured that major gas exporters offer more gas on the domestic—

           We've ensured that major gas exporters offer more gas on the domestic market more often and on more competitive terms, meaning lower prices. We're developing an industry code of conduct to address pricing principles, and all of our collective efforts are delivering results. Even before COVID-19, we saw reductions in the domestic spot price across eastern Australia, and these prices have continued to fall. Wholesale gas prices on the east coast during 2020 were around 40 per cent lower than prices in 2019, and these prices remain low. Lower gas prices are also driving down wholesale electricity prices. Those opposite can't even work out if they support gas. But, thankfully for Australian households and businesses, we are consistent on the issue.

              I thank the senator. Gas is a critical enabler of Australia's economy. It supports our manufacturing sector, which employs over 850,000 Australians, and is an essential input in the production of a range of items such as plastic for
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
               PPE
              </a>
              and fertiliser for food production. Ensuring a reliable, stable and affordable supply of gas to power Australian jobs and industries is one of the highest priorities of this Liberal and National government. Those opposite don't have a plan to secure the dispatchable capacity that the manufacturing industry will rely on into the future. We know, Senator McAllister, what your plans are, because Labor's real plan is always higher taxes—more and higher taxes. We saw it at the last election with their $387 billion plan for more taxes. They've only got one plan.
