        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Senator Watt. Former special forces commando Heston Russell repeatedly asked for a correction and an apology for stories the ABC published that defamed him and November platoon, accusing them of committing war crimes in Afghanistan at a time when they weren't even in that country. He offered to settle the case for $99,000, which the ABC refused, and proceeded to trial. The defamatory articles were brought to the attention of Minister Rowland, the Minister for Communications, by a 26,000-signature petition, which she acknowledged on 20 March and on which she failed to act. Minister, what is the cost to the taxpayer for the

         Thank you, Senator Roberts, for that question. I will have to take on notice the exact details of that question that you've asked. Presumably, these are matters that you'd also have the opportunity to ask the ABC at estimates next week. So I am happy to come back to you with any details that I can provide on that. The broader issue around any defamation action taken against the ABC is really a matter for ABC management. Of course, this government believes in the independence of the ABC and, in particular, its editorial independence.

           Senator Rennick, on the other hand, thinks that it's a biased organisation. That's a very disappointing remark to make about the national broadcaster but perhaps one that we're used to after years of ABC cuts under the former government. It would appear that Senator Rennick isn't the only member of the opposition who regards the ABC as biased. Again, it's a very disappointing view to express about the national broadcaster—the only publicly funded broadcaster. Again, it probably indicates why the ABC suffered such severe funding cuts under the former government.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, Senator Roberts, you'll obviously have the opportunity to ask those questions of ABC management at estimates next week. I know Senator Henderson always has questions for the ABC as well, so she will no doubt do that again next week.

                 The judge in this trial was scathing of the ABC journalists involved in the case, saying they became defensive and considered any criticism as merely part of a culture-war attack and this inhibited 'a proper remedial response to criticism'.

                 journalists thought they were part of a culture war, and that prevented them from acting impartially and reasonably, leading to a potential multimillion dollar bill to taxpayers. Minister, what consequences will the journalists involved face for eroding people's trust in the ABC, and why hasn't their employment already been terminated?

                     from some of the people who are yelling across the chamber now in matters involving the ABC. These are matters that are the responsibility of ABC management, and we respect their independence. I understand, Senator Roberts, that the Federal Court has obviously handed down its decision in these defamation proceedings. There do remain several settlement matters before the court, so I probably shouldn't be commenting any further on what might happen there. And, as I've said, the ABC is responsible for managing its legal matters, including defamation claims and litigation, just as any media proprietor, whether it be publicly funded or privately owned, is responsible for managing its legal matters, including when it's sued for defamation. We believe that the ABC is a trusted source of news, information and entertainment for all Australians and we support it.

I welcome your sudden interest in misinformation and disinformation, and I hope that that's something that you will retain an interest in when it comes to election campaigns that you're involved in, Senator Roberts. I really do hope that you do that. We'd like to hear more about that.

                            Hello, Gerard; how are you? Of course, the government does have legislation before the parliament to deal with misinformation and disinformation. We think that it is an important issue in today's media environment, particularly in the social media environment that we're operating under, and we think that it's an important piece of legislation to deal with.
