        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. Minister Burke has indicated that he is waiting for the national heritage council to provide a report on the possible National Heritage listing of the Tarkine. This will mean a ministerial decision as late as the second half of next year. Given that 58 exploration licences have now been issued, seven new mining leases have been granted and three existing mines are operating in the area, is the minister aware that the implication of such a delay could see around 80 per cent of the region opened up to mining and exploration before Minister Burke makes his decision?

         I thank the senator for his question. The Gillard government is committed to a thorough environmental assessment under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC
         </a>
         Act to ensure that matters of national environmental significance in the Tarkine region are protected. The assessment process under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC Act
         </a>
         is rigorous, and there are a number of points at which the public will be invited to comment. Mining and development projects are currently being assessed under the national environmental law in the Tarkine region.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government has a role in regulating proposals that impact on matters protected by national environmental law, including matters of national environmental significance such as listed threatened species. Only actions which might have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance are required to be referred for approval under national environmental law. Minister Burke is well aware of the issues in the Tarkine. He has been to the Tarkine region on a number of occasions where he met with mining stakeholders, environment groups and tourist operators to better understand the issues before he makes any decisions.

         's campaign was I think mentioned by Senator Abetz, and consideration is being given to the National Heritage values of the Tarkine. National Heritage listing of the Tarkine would not mean an automatic lockout for development or other activities; rather, it would ensure that the Tarkine's heritage values are given appropriate consideration in statutory decision making. If there is anything further, I will take it on notice and see whether the minister has anything further to add.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Considering that the current minister allowed the region's emergency heritage listing to lapse after it had been listed by the previous minister,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Garrett" rel="nofollow">
           Peter Garrett
          </a>
          , what action if any does the government propose to undertake to preserve the region's wilderness values and to prevent further conflict in the region while the assessment process continues? I will put the context of my question very clearly: this is in line with the fact that, as you mentioned, the minister has commented on the public record that he does see significant conservation values in the Tarkine.

           I am not sure what I can add to my earlier answer. There is a thorough process being gone through and the minister is very conscious of these issues, as you would probably know. The minister, like many of us, was in Tasmania last week and, again, Minister Burke met with all the stakeholders.

              I reject utterly the premise of the question. There is a thorough process underway and, as I said in my previous answer, even if the process were successful it would not stop developments that fit within the process. Minister Burke is fully aware of the issues. He was there as recently as last week, consulting with stakeholders. I noted that in answering some questions from the floor in the community cabinet meeting, Minister Burke always—

               , I ask a further supplementary question. Perhaps I could put it a different way, Senator Conroy. Wouldn't bringing forward the decision on National Heritage listing provide economic certainty for businesses invested in the area, such as tourism and existing heavy industry, in addition to addressing environmental considerations and preventing a significant conflict in a state that needs to move forward?

                has completed its assessment and will recommend that the Tarkine be inscribed on the National Heritage List. The report will include a recommended boundary and place report. Minister Burke does not anticipate that the council will recommend a blanket listing of the Tarkine. Once Minister Burke receives the assessment, he will consider it and the comments received from the council very carefully. Minister Burke may seek further information and advice before making a decision. A National Heritage listing of the Tarkine would not mean an automatic lockout for development or other activities; rather, it would ensure that the Tarkine's heritage values are given appropriate consideration in statutory decision making. The Tasmanian devil and other listed threatened fauna in the Tarkine area have not been specifically identified as having key National Heritage values in the current public consultation information—
