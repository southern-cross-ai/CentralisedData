           Labor acknowledges efforts to refine the wording of this motion, but we are unable to come to an agreement on final words. Labor welcomes cruise ships to Australia as a rapidly growing means of bringing international tourists to Australia, therefore creating local jobs. As with all industries, the environmental impacts of cruise shipping need to be carefully managed.

           community concerns to a New South Wales inquiry, and it has welcomed the recent decision of the New South Wales government to copy New South Wales Labor's policy to mandate low-sulfur fuel. Federal Labor supports work with state governments and the cruise industry to minimise local community impacts, including fuel use, berthing practices, noise monitoring and ship to shore power.

              Labor. The New South Wales coalition government is taking action. By 1 January 2020, all ships docked at Australian ports must comply with much stricter pollution controls when docked in port. A revised international agreement will provide much stricter limits on air pollutants contained in ship exhaust gas, including sulfur oxides and nitrous oxides, and prohibit deliberate emissions of ozone-depleting substances. By 2020, all ships docked at White Bay will be required to implement new measures to reduce the sulfur cap in fuel from 3.5 per cent to 0.5 per cent.

              , for commencing consultations with the cruise industry to bring forward new measures ahead of 1 January 2020. The Commonwealth government supports stronger action to improve air quality, including actions by the cruise ship industry to introduce measures ahead of 2020 to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from cruise liners docked at ports near residential areas.
