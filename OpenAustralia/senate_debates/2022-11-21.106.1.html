        Today I'm going to read out a speech by 11-year-old Ida Adams from my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . In fact, she goes to primary school just around the corner from where I live in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Hills
        </a>
        . It's been written as part of the Raise Our Voice in Parliament campaign, which amplifies the voices of young people and their visions for the future. Ida says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm passionate about making this place a better world for humans and animals alike.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are many significant problems in the world, including world hunger, homelessness, violence and lack of biodiversity. But by far the most important is climate change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is an amazing country and we are all so fortunate to live in it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But, it may not stay one. Our leaders need to understand what climate change is and take action.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is no longer just plastic pollution but overuse of electricity, fossil fuel mining, vehicles, food production and so, so much more.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These things tragically result in multiple consequences such as weed and pest invasion, salt invasions, extreme temperatures etc., resulting in an unliveable climate for humans, plants and animals alike.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia can't stay this way and if we keep polluting it will just get worse. This problem is major and you can't ignore it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need to figure out further solutions and replacements for oil, gas, water and other resources.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But importantly, we need more government funding for this research to happen.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We created the problem so we can fix it together for a strong and healthy Australia. But the leaders of today need to have insightâ€”see what is wrong and step up for what is right.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The solutions to problems of tomorrow are in the hands of the politicians today.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's the statement from Ida Adams in South Australia.
