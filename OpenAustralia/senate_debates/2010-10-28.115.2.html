          <i>

             in Tasmania has seen a steady increase in the take-up of services. Following community consultation in the first release site, there has also been a strong and positive consent rate of residents choosing to connect to the NBN. For the interest of those opposite—and you can draw your own conclusions about the comments of a particular

This agreement is being recommended to shareholders by the board so unless they are in breach of the corporations law they are recommending the agreement to their shareholders.

                      Your question started with a false premise and it just goes wrong from there. I was talking about paradigm-shifting for the new pricing product offered by the company you were referring to. The

                      is changing the entire structure of the market. In the new structurally separated market, which those opposite have now finally decided they support, there will be a paradigm shift. But let me be very clear about this: your premise is false. We do not have a low take-up; we are actually ahead of schedule. I listed them yesterday and I will proudly list them again for you: Willunga, 87 per cent; Armidale, 84 per cent—
