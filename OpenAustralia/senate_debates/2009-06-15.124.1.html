        By way of explanation, the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on 3 December 2008 and referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, as I mentioned. The amendments will ensure that the exceptions will be available where joint venturers can prove that they intended to be and reasonably believed that they were party to a valid joint venture contract. The supplementary explanatory material also provides examples of the operation of joint venture exceptions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government’s amendments extend the joint venture exceptions under sections 44ZZRO and 44ZZRP of the bill to cover an arrangement or understanding that is not a contract but was intended and reasonably believed by the parties to be a contract. For example, the amendments would cover situations where the joint venturers intended to enter into and reasonably believed they had entered into a contract but failed to do so because they lacked capacity or a condition precedent was not satisfied. This change will provide additional comfort to legitimate joint venturers who have sought to formalise their dealings in a contract.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments also insert an explanatory note in the joint venture exceptions of the bill to provide an example in relation to research and development. The results of an R&amp;D joint venture, even if just provided to joint venture participants, would amount to a supply of a service that could bring it within the exception. Examples are included in the supplementary explanatory memorandum to demonstrate that certain types of activity could fall within the joint venture exceptions where that activity is for the purpose of the joint venture. The examples also make readers aware that there are other general exception provisions in the bill that may also be relevant to joint ventures, such as the collective acquisition of goods and services exception.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the explanatory memorandum is amended to incorporate a recommendation made by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Paragraph 8.15 of the explanatory memorandum is to be amended to refer to an amendment made by item 30 of schedule 2 of the bill. I thank the two Senate committees for their good work.
