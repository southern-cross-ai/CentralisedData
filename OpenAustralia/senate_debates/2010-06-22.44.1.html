          Another day, Senator Wong, I am sure. I refer the minister to his statement to the Senate yesterday, which said of his much hyped agreement with Telstra that it:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">

          Will the minister inform the Senate how much faster and how much cheaper?

           I thank Senator Birmingham for that question particularly, because I am drawn to a comment in today’s papers from

            John Durie
           </a>
           , who was talking about this. He talked about the cost and what was being paid to Telstra. John Durie said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Payment for Telstra assets was just compensation after previous governments failed to take the chance to restructure the industry before it was too late and the company was fully privatised.

            , I rise on a point of order. You know that there were two amounts sought in the question and that was all: how much faster and how much cheaper? The minister has not addressed the question at all. He has quoted commentary by an economic commentator, who does not address the quantities either, and he has engaged in abuse of the opposition. You should direct him to the question, which was specific to two quantities: how much faster and how much cheaper?

             , on the point of order: the minister has been directly answering the question. The minister has been relevant to the question. There were two parts to the point of order that was taken. One was, of course, not mentioned but I assume it was on relevance. The second was on the accuracy of the minister’s statement, and I say there is no point of order in respect of that.

I think when it comes to standing orders related to tedious repetition, you might find that during Senator Brandis’s point of order the minister opened the file that he had yesterday and is now reading the exact same words he said yesterday—the ultimate in tedious repetition.

But if you care to read some of the commentary today, which I know is a painful exercise for you, you will see industry commentators with some experience in the sector, unlike those opposite, who claim that the savings are in the billions—that is, industry experts in the papers today: ‘in the billions’.

                   , I will try a supplementary question that may not have such commercial sensitivity. I refer the minister to his subsequent statement to the Senate yesterday that under his so-called agreement ‘a greater proportion of the

                   rollout will be underground’. Will the minister inform the Senate what proportion will be underground? How much greater will it be as a result of this so-called agreement?

                    The agreement with Telstra means that the rollout of the

                    , as you have correctly identified from my statements yesterday, can be built on existing infrastructure, including Telstra’s network of ducts and facilities. This clearly means a reduction in civil engineering costs, which are usually a significant proportion of any rollout. NBN Co. will be able to maximise its use of underground cabling. This means there will be less overhead cabling by definition—substantially less. The agreement will also allow an orderly transition for Telstra’s customers—

                     , I raise a point of order. Once again the question was directed to two quantities: what proportion and how much greater. Nothing the minister has said has been relevant to that question and it certainly has not been directly relevant to it. He was asked about two quantities and he has not approached naming them.

                      , Senator Conroy went directly to the question of the infrastructure and whether it was underground or overhead. He went exactly to that question and was attempting to give the Senate an appropriate answer. I do not know whether the opposition have run out of questions, because they are wasting their time and question time. But clearly the minister was directly relevant and attempting to answer the senator’s question.
