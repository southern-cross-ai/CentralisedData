         I understand that Senator Siewert has a notice of motion later today, and I acknowledge her continuing efforts to improve Indigenous eye health. I am pleased to advise the Senate that the government will be investing $4.6 million over four years, from 2015-16, towards enhancing Indigenous eye health through the provision of eye health coordinators. The eye health sector, in particular the Chair of Vision 2020, the Hon.

         —well-known to this chamber—and Professor Hugh Taylor of the Indigenous Eye Health Unit at the University of Melbourne, has strongly advocated for national oversight of Indigenous eye health, and I am pleased to be able to announce this today.

          for Vision
         </i>
         notes the importance of eye care coordination, particularly at a national level, to improve service planning and delivery. The role of eye health coordinators will include work to improve the eye care pathway from patient entry to completion of care, thereby improving the patient journey and enhancing efficiency of services at the local, regional and jurisdictional levels. Eye health coordinators will work with stakeholders such as local hospital networks, Primary Health Networks and Indigenous health services to ensure that use of local service providers and existing health systems is maximised.
        </p>
        <p>
         I congratulate the representatives of the Indigenous eye health sector who collaborated to bring forward this funding proposal. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Vision 2020 for finalising a proposal which brings together the sector for the first time to deliver this program. Other members I would like to acknowledge include the Indigenous Eye Health Unit at the University of Melbourne, Optometry Australia, the

           In addition to my announcement, I am also delighted to inform the Senate that funding of up to $1.6 million over two years will be provided to the Indigenous Eye Health Unit at the University of Melbourne to undertake trachoma health promotion. This was also a component of the Indigenous eye health sector proposal. Trachoma is a major blinding infectious eye disease occurring in 60 per cent of outback communities. Australia has made good progress in reducing the rates of trachoma but more work is required to achieve elimination. This funding will go towards health promotion focusing on clean faces and safe bathrooms to complement other existing trachoma activities. Again, I would like to acknowledge the continued advocacy of Professor Taylor over many years and note the government will be continuing to work closely with him to eradicate trachoma.

             In addition to smoking prevention programs, key investments over the next three years include $1.4 billion to the Aboriginal community controlled health services for primary and preventative care, $154.5 million to the New directions: mothers and babies services program for child and maternal health services and $62.6 million to the Australian Nurse-Family Partnership program to provide targeted support to high-need Indigenous Australians. Improving Indigenous health is a priority for the government and all healthcare providers both within the community controlled healthcare system and the mainstream system.
