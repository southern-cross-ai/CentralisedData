        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

        , Senator Ludwig. Given that the national Preventative Health Taskforce has recommended indepen足dent modelling for a rationalised tax and excise regime for alcohol that discourages harmful consumption and promotes safer consumption, can the minister advise what modelling has been undertaken and the results of that modelling.

         In relation to the modelling, I will have to take that part of the question on notice. There is a question of whether the portfolio of Health has undertaken the modelling or whether it was Treasury. If it was Treasury then it would be not within my portfolio area. But I will take that part of the question on notice and see what information Minister Roxon can provide in respect of it.

         I am aware that the public health lobby want to discuss alcohol tax issues at the Tax Forum. That is an issue that they have been, as I understand it, lobbying quite strongly for. In respect of this issue, this government recognises that binge drinking among young people in particular is a very important issue and that is why the government has invested $103.5 million over six years into the National Binge Drinking Strategy. That $103.5 million goes to $20 million for the 'Don't turn the night out into a nightmare' campaign; $34.4 million for community-level initiatives; $25 million for a community sponsorship fund; $19.1 million for early intervention pilot programs, which are particularly helpful; and $5 million for enhanced phone counselling. This government does take the issue seriously. We also understand that the senator has an interest in this particular area and has been following it very closely. We will continue to build on the programs we have put forward and, depending on the portfolio responsibility, I will see what additional information I can find regarding the modelling I indicated earlier.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given the Henry tax review's findings that the social costs of alcohol abuse by individuals are not effectively targeted by current tax and subsidy arrangements for alcohol, will the government commit to a thorough and substantial review of alcohol taxation at the upcoming tax summit in October?

           It seems that this question, although to the health portfolio, quite frankly relates to Treasury and to the tax summit itself. But I can find information that will assist. If the public health lobby and interested parties want to raise this issue, they do have an opportunity. The government welcomes a broad and constructive discussion of tax issues at the tax forum in October. We encourage people to raise these issues in that forum. Any discussion of alcohol could easily be raised in the session that relates to the environment and social taxes. Currently local government and community organisations can share up to $10 million for projects to combat risky drinking among young people.

            , I have a further supplementary question. Given the government's under足taking to investigate the National Preventative Health Taskforce recom足mendation around warning labels on alcoholic beverages, will the government commit to a labelling system as recom足mended by public health experts rather than relying on industry self-regulation?

             Alcohol labelling is a matter that was raised in the Blewett review. We as a government recognise and welcome initiatives and policies from the public health sector and industry. The government is continuing to take feedback from all interested parties to the Blewett review of food labelling, including that part of the review that related to alcohol labelling. The Australian and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council is developing a joint statement and Commonwealth response, which is expected at the end of this year. The government remains in the process of developing a response to the Blewett review, particularly the area that I understand the senator has the greatest interest in, which goes to a number of the recommendations about the use of food labels to promote preventative health, including alcohol.
