        My question is for the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Minister Watt. We are in a black deaths in custody crisis, with 558 deaths since the 19991
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission

        </a>
        . Since coming into government, the Albanese government has implemented just one recommendation from the royal commission: a live body-bag count of our people coming out of prisons. Shame! That's one recommendation in two years. Minister, my question is: what's the next recommendation this government is going to implement?

         Thank you, Senator Thorpe, for this question about a very important topic. You would be aware, Senator Thorpe, because I think you've asked similar questions about this before, that the Albanese government has been taking action in the time that we have been in government on these issues and on the issue of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         justice needs more generally.
        </p>
        <p>
         More than 30 years on from the royal commission, deaths in custody continue to have a devastating impact on First Nations families and communities. While states and territories hold most of the levers, the Albanese government is playing a leadership role in tackling this issue. We know—

           Senator Thorpe, there was not a long preamble but there was a reference to black deaths in custody and recommendations which the minister is also entitled to go. But I will listen carefully and, if he doesn't fully address your question, I will draw him to the question.

            The Albanese government recognises that there is unfinished business when it comes to implementing the recommendations of the royal commission more than 30 years on from when it handed down its report. We know that the key to addressing what is a national shame, the rate of deaths in custody amongst
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             First Nations
            </a>
            people, and reducing that rate is reducing the rate at which First Nations people enter the criminal justice system in the first place. That's why we are investing in up to 30 community led justice reinvestment initiatives across Australia—

                   Thank you, Senator Thorpe. You've mentioned that one of the recommendations of the royal commission relates to the age of criminal responsibility, and that is a matter that the Attorney-General is working with the state attorneys-general on at the moment—so with his colleagues. So that is a recommendation where action is ongoing.

                   As I say, in the meantime we are taking other action on other matters, with our $99 million

                   legal services and to provide culturally appropriate legal assistance in coronial inquiries and also real-time reporting of deaths in custody, which was introduced in June last year. As I say, the Attorney-General is also working closely with his state and territory colleagues on a proposal to raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility, to ensure that the youngest First Nations offenders are supported to turn their lives around rather than set on a cycle of imprisonment and reoffending.

                     Most prisons still contain hanging points. This is basically the government facilitating the suicide of those imprisoned under inhumane conditions, which happened again on

                      I would have to take on notice the specific details about work that is going on on that particular recommendation. Obviously, that is something that we would like to see continued progress on. As Senator Thorpe was aware before she left the chamber, we have been working on this matter with the states and territories. Custodial premises—jails—are run by states and territories, and that is something that we need to work with them on.
