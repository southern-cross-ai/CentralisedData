           receive nearly $1.4 billion a year in funding from the Australian government, and I think that all of us on this side of the chamber would agree that one of the first and primary jobs of government is to make sure that taxpayers' dollars are well and efficiently expended. This government knows that there is the capacity at the ABC for savings to be made without reducing programming. Any suggestion at all that popular programs or services are at risk because of budget savings is completely absurd, as are any suggestions that inefficiency should be left unchecked. The previous minister, as is well known, did nothing to improve the efficiency of the public broadcasters. He did nothing to address the accelerating structural decline of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           , and he did nothing to affect the unfolding financial disaster that is

           Co. Senator Seselja, I know that the word 'neglect' comes to your mind as I say those words. In contrast, this government is not going to sit idly by. A working draft of the ABC and SBS Efficiency Study has been handed to both public broadcasters to assist them in managing their businesses more efficiently, and I know that Minister Turnbull looks forward very much to working with them over the coming months to achieve this goal.

             I think we all know that a commercial broadcaster will always do its best to reduce costs without affecting its investment in programming, particularly popular programming. On the other hand, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
              ABC's
             </a>
             revenues are not a function of its ratings or performance, but of its ability to persuade the government of the day. The easiest way to cut costs is to cut programming, rather than to tackle out-of-date business and administrative practices. That is why this government commissioned the efficiency study—to assist the ABC in making the tough decisions which will save money by reducing waste. The purpose of the efficiency study is to assist the ABC in identifying inefficient administration, so that savings can be made without affecting programming.

               We all know that, in the broad, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Labor Party
               </a>
               has very little interest in ensuring that government agencies are run efficiently, so I was absolutely delighted to see that the member for Blaxland agrees with the government on this point. On Sky recently, the member for Blaxland said he believed there was some value in an efficiency drive by the broadcaster, and he said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Any organisation can be more efficient, and I am sure there are things that are happening in the ABC and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
                SBS

               where money could be better spent elsewhere.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think this is one small step for caucus but one giant leap for the Australian Labor Party, courtesy of the member for Blaxland. I can assure Senator Seselja and colleagues that the government is confident that efficiencies can be made without impacting on programming.
