        My question is to the Minister for Communications and Minister representing the Minister for Sport, Senator Fifield. The government plans to give $30 million to subscription television:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … to support the broadcast of underrepresented sports on subscription television, including women's sports, niche sports, and sports with a high level of community involvement and participation; …

            Correct. That was the notion and the accuracy displayed in your question, but the minister, in fairness, has only gone a quarter into his answer and he is on topic. The minister has heard your point of order. Senator Farrell.

                          . Now, what I was going to move to next, after having made that point, is that my department is negotiating, with Fox Sports, a funding deed, which will have milestones and will have those things that are required in order to satisfy the obligations for receiving that particular support in the budget measure. I go back to where I started: there's nothing unusual, in the budget context, in that there is no correspondence between the department and stakeholders. The announcement was made in the context of the budget and, as I've indicated, there is a funding deed being negotiated—as you would expect and is common practice—when there is a grant.

                             report in 2014 determined that about 70 per cent of all women's sports coverage in Australia occurred on Fox Sports. Fox Sports have a good track record of providing coverage for sports with a lower profile that are neglected by the free-to-airs. Fox Sports have four dedicated sports channels. They have got a good track record, and the government thinks that this is an appropriate way to support further coverage of women's sport.

If there isn't correspondence beforehand, they say, 'Aha, conspiracy.' This is a straightforward matter that was determined in the context of the budget. As is the case when it comes to these announcements, there's a decision taken in the budget, there's a grant to be made before money is handed across and there is a funding deed, with requirements and milestones, that is put into place. This is standard practice and that will happen.
