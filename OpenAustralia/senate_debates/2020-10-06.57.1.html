        My question is for the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Last Wednesday night at approximately 8 o'clock, about eight hours after I announced I wouldn't be supporting the government's higher education bill, veterans and serving members and their families were given a slap down by the government when it announced that Dr Bernadette Boss is to serve as the interim
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         National Commissioner
        </a>
        for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention. Dr Boss served for seven years as a legal officer in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        . She saw operational service in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        . In separate meetings with both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance I was assured in no uncertain terms that the interim commissioner would not—would not!—be a current or former military serving member in any way, shape or form. How on earth can that commitment be reconciled with the fact the interim commissioner is actually a senior ranking brigadier?

         I thank Senator Lambie for the question. Senator Lambie, as you'd be aware, and certainly as the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister have made clear on a number of occasions, reducing lives lost to suicide is a priority for the Australian government. Senator Lambie, like you, all members in this chamber recognise that the death of any
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         member or veteran is beyond tragic for the family and is deeply felt by the entire community. Preventing suicide amongst ADF personnel and within our veteran community is a critical priority for the Australian government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Lambie, you are correct: on 30 September 2020 the Attorney-General did announce the appointment of Dr Bernadette Boss,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSC" rel="nofollow">
          CSC
         </a>
         , as the interim national commissioner. Dr Boss has served as a magistrate and coroner in the Australian Capital Territory Magistrates Court. She also holds a PhD from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          University of Sydney
         </a>
         and she has practised as a barrister in Australia and in the United Kingdom, primarily in the area of family law, criminal law, administrative law and human rights law. In terms of her credentials, Dr Boss also served in various command and staff roles in the ADF, primarily as a reservist. She also worked in the healthcare system as a nurse. It is the position of the Attorney-General and the government that Dr Boss's experience makes her well placed to engage with families, friends and communities affected by the loss of a loved one to suicide. Dr Boss will undertake the role of national commissioner until legislation formally establishing the position has been enacted.

           I've already heard from veterans around the country that are up in arms, that they've already written this off as a stitch-up. I'm telling you what's coming from them: no trust. You've got a real problem here already and we haven't even got the interim commissioner started. Doesn't this government realise that in order for the interim commissioner to have any positive impact whatsoever it needs to have the confidence and support of the community it seeks to serve, especially veterans and families who have lost their own sons and daughters? Why did you not appoint someone independent of the institutions they're charged with investigating?

            Again, I will just reiterate that reducing lives lost to suicide is a priority for the Australian government. I've already confirmed that on 30 September 2020 the Attorney-General announced the appointment of Dr Bernadette Boss as the interim national commissioner and I've taken you through the reasons as to why Dr Boss was appointed. As you know, she will undertake the role of national commissioner until legislation establishing the position has been enacted. Certainly the government congratulates Dr Boss on her appointment.

              Part of the job of the interim commissioner is to make recommendations to the permanent national commissioner regarding the direction and operation of that office into the future. The government has allowed 12 months for the interim commissioner to produce an interim report and 18 months for a final report. My question is: will this interim report period be allowed to inform the operation of the national commissioner before they proceed, or will the government jump straight into action without first giving any pause to consider the findings and recommendations of that office?

               Again, thank you, Senator Lambie. Certainly at this point in time, the government is now going through the process of the introduction of the legislation and the consultation process, of which you are aware. You would be aware that on 27 August the Attorney-General himself introduced the

                National Commissioner

               for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention Bill 2020 and the National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2020 to the parliament. You'd also be aware that, at this point in time, they have had a four-week period of public and stakeholder consultation, and the public consultation, as you know, concluded on 24 September 2020. We've actually received over 90 submissions from a range of both individuals and organisations, and it is also expected that some further outstanding submissions will now be provided. The government is currently considering all of the submissions—
