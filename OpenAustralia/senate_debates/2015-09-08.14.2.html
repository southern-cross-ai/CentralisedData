           Senator Carr interjects and says, 'Truth'—and it is correct that they are running an ongoing campaign to discredit a royal commission which has exposed corruption day after day within certain elements of the trade union movement. I would have thought any trade unionists worthy of their calling as a trade union official representing the workers of Australia would want to see a clean trade union movement.
          </p>
          <p>
           What puts the lie to Senator Conroy's assertion is
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms_Jackson" rel="nofollow">
            Ms Jackson
           </a>
           's response after her day in the witness box. You know what? She felt 'ambushed' by the royal commission. Here is a classic example of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           not being able to get their story right. Ms Jackson says that she was 'ambushed' and that that is why she was not as good a witness as she otherwise might have been—I do not know what her rationale was. Yet here we have the Australian Labor Party asserting that she was coached every single step of the way. Get your story straight.
          </p>
          <p>
           One thing we know about this royal commission is that the Labor senators that want to defend trade union corruption cannot get their story straight—never can, never will, never have. What we want to ensure is that the worthy cause of trade unionism—

            receive advance personal coaching regarding questions she would be answering at the royal commission? Is it because she is regarded by the Prime Minister as 'heroic' and by this minister as 'courageous'? Did the commission take advantage of Michael's Lawler's offer to discard or cut out parts of Ms Jackson's witness statements?

              I can understand Senator Conroy's sensitivity, given that some of his factional warriors have been exposed in not the best of light by the royal commission and the evidence that has been coming out. To assert that
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms_Jackson" rel="nofollow">
               Ms Jackson
              </a>
              received special coaching—well, what fantastic special coaching it was; when she says afterwards, 'I was ambushed'—really, there is no credibility in Senator Conroy in any way, shape or form.
             </p>
             <p>
              The documents show that procedural fairness was accorded, as it was to other people that have appeared before the royal commission. But I think the proof is in Ms Jackson's own statements that she felt 'ambushed'—in other words, no favours done.
