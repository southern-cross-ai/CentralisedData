        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care, Senator Gallagher. The aged-care royal commission's final report told a shocking story of neglect, inaction and a lack of ambition to plan for the growing demand in the aged-care sector. A key recommendation of the final report is that registered nurses be required on site in residential aged-care homes 24 hours a day seven days a week. The report also—

            The report also recommended the introduction of minimum care time for registered nurses, enrolled nurses and personal care workers. How is the Albanese government delivering its election commitment to put nurses back into nursing homes?

             I thank Senator Polley for her continued interest in this important area of service delivery and reform for the Albanese government. I acknowledge the work that Minister Wells from the other place has been doing in implementing the recommendations from the royal commission and cleaning up and improving the standard of care that's provided to our most elderly citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
             Aged-care workers care for some of our most vulnerable older Australians. They do crucial, demanding and highly skilled work every day. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
              Royal Commission
             </a>
             into Aged Care Quality and Safety found that unacceptable staffing levels in aged-care homes had created horrific environments of substandard care caused by a lack of ambition to plan for growing demand in the sector. That's why we acted very quickly to lift the standard of care and implement the recommendations of the royal commission to make sure that aged-care residents get the clinical care they need.
            </p>
            <p>
             On average, there is now a registered nurse on site in aged care 98 per cent of the time in Australia, or 23½ hours a day. Eighty-eight per cent of all homes that reported data have a nurse 24/7, and the majority of remaining homes are extremely close to meeting that target. We're also seeing improvements in the amount of care being provided by registered nurses, enrolled nurses and personal care workers. Our data shows that older Australians are receiving an additional 1.8 million minutes of care every single day under the Albanese government.

               <p>
                Our commitment to build a skilled aged-care workforce is having a real, tangible effect on the ground. In the past year, there has been a reduction in the number of pressure injuries, significant unplanned weight loss, falls and polypharmacy in the use of antipsychotics, and in the use of physical restraints in aged care. We're also seeing improvements in the star ratings data, with fewer one- and two-star ratings and more four- and five-star ratings. That's what 24/7 nursing has always been about—building trust, fewer falls, fewer injuries, fewer avoidable hospital admissions and more older people feeling safe and respected in aged care.
               </p>
               <p>
                Before the election, older Australians were scared about the prospect of going into an aged-care home, with the royal commission exposing the shocking tale of neglect that happened on the watch of those opposite. Now, in the response to the reforms of this government, trust and confidence in the sector is growing.

                   I thank Senator Polley for that supplementary—and, yes, I can. Aged-care workers for way too long were underpaid and undervalued for their crucial work. In fact they were some of the lowest paid workers in the economy. Is it any wonder that we saw people leaving the sector to find jobs elsewhere?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In the May budget we funded a historic pay rise for aged-care workers—a 15 per cent increase to the award minimum—and, because of this pay rise, personal care workers are now taking home up to $7,300 more each year than they were getting under the former government. Registered nurses are taking home up to $10,000 more each year. We're seeing the difference that this is making to recruitment and retention. Data from seek.com showed a 72 per cent increase in applications per job advertisement for aged-care nursing roles from January 2023 to June 2023.
