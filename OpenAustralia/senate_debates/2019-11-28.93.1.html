         Thank you very much, Senator Davey. More than seven million Australians live outside our capital cities, and the Liberal-National government backs their aspirations for a strong and prosperous future. Recently, I was able to visit the Jolliffes' farm in the Riverina. They're real dairy farmers. Their son is finishing the

          HSC

         and they have employed a young farm-worker, and both of those young people want to stay on farm and work in agriculture in their local communities, despite the drought, and they're planning for their future.
        </p>
        <p>
         The No. 1 issue that we hear about as we travel through rural and regional Australia is local job provision. That is why our side of government supports and backs our mining industry. That's why we support and back our agriculture industry, now and for the next generation.

         ns want to ensure that their kids can access a high-quality education—that geography should not be a determinant for opportunity in this country—and we are working very, very clearly towards that end. They want high-quality health care, and they want connectivity of the 21st century—not just roads and rail but digital connectivity to help them connect with the markets of the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why we've been able to deliver a half-a-billion-dollar stronger rural health workforce package, where we're going to have 3,000

         s and 3,000 nurses, additional, out into rural and regional Australia. It's why we've also got record funding going to schools in this country and a $152 million regional student access to education program. We've got half a billion dollars in additional new funding to improve regional higher education opportunities, through income support and scholarships. We've increased funding for mobile black spot programs and for Sky Muster and a $60 million Regional Connectivity Program to sustain and improve access to essential services for our rural and regional economies and also backing the industries that underpin them.

            has been dealing with drought for years and is now faced with the ongoing threat of bushfires, Senator Davey. These difficulties are being felt right across our country, as the drought continues to spread and the disasters follow. These are real issues affecting real people in regional Australia, and it is our government that is offering real and tangible support in real time. For those affected by bushfires, we've got the disaster recovery payment: $1,000 for eligible adults; $400 for eligible students. That is actual support going into communities right now. We've stepped up our response to the drought recently, recognising that it doesn't just stop at the farm gate. We've got support for communities, small business loan packages, farm household allowance expansion and simplification, rural financial counselling services and more mental health and wellbeing services, in addition to a $200 million drought-specific BBRF round.

               Well, our government is delivering real improvements in jobs, connectivity, health and education. These are the real issues that people out in the regions want our government to address, because we actually believe that regional Australia has a strong and prosperous future. We've been negotiating free trade agreements for better market access so our farmers and our miners can grow our exports and employ more people locally. We've got regional migration initiatives to ensure that our population grows and prospers and a suite of agricultural workforce solutions to make sure that we get the right people in the right place at the right time to get the crop off.
              </p>
              <p>
               But what about those opposite? They equivocate on free trade agreements, when agriculture exports two-thirds of what we produce. They're promising a floor price for dairy that the dairy industry doesn't want. They want to shut down the live sheep and cattle trade. They want to shut down our mines. They don't want to build a dam. They've pursued—
