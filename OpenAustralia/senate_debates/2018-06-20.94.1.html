         (â€”) (): I thank Senator Reynolds for her question. Australia is of course very committed to supporting a secure and stable Pacific. We are strengthening our engagement through a number of initiatives, as I know the Minister for

         and the Pacific is well aware. From a defence perspective, our Joint Task Group Indo-Pacific Endeavour 18 is a current major maritime activity that reflects our commitment to deepen our engagement and our partnerships with regional security forces in the Pacific through both dialogue and practical activities.

            This is very important. It is not just in the Pacific that we are increasing our defence engagement. Across more than a dozen engagements at the Shangri-La Dialogue I noted repeatedly that we are engaging with nations small and large, both bilaterally and in smaller groupings, to strengthen the cohesion of nations that share our vision for the region, that contribute to security and stability in our region. Whether it's through training, through exercises, through educational opportunities or through improved information-sharing, we are always looking at ways to build on our capacity and our interoperability across the Indo-Pacific. We are providing practical support wherever we can, as requested by our partners. I think the best current example of that is the government's assistance to the government of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">

            meetings in November of this year. We work closely with our partners across the region, particularly on counterterrorism, and specifically with the Philippines, with Indonesia, with Malaysia and with Singapore to address that continuing threat.

               I thank Senator Reynolds. There's one very timely example of our ability to work closely with our partners, which is built on a foundation of shared interests and values and of people-to-people links that have been established over decades. Next week, Australia and Malaysia will mark the 60th anniversary of Australia's presence at the Royal Malaysian
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Air Force

               Base Butterworth. Generations of ADF members have lived and worked at Butterworth, including my own partner's parents, with their two young sons for a period. Many have built important bonds with their Malaysian counterparts. Around 100 former ADF personnel are expected to attend next week's celebration, which is a mark of the very special place that Butterworth holds in the hearts and minds of many Australians. The longevity of that engagement and our presence there at Butterworth testifies to Malaysia's and Australia's shared interests and also to both nations' commitment to regional stability. These are very important relationships on which we continue to build.
