               , I know I am not the brightest in this chamber but I have no idea what the amendment is because this has been guillotined through by the Labor Party and the Greens. I would again ask the Clerk to read the amendment that we are voting upon.

                Senator Macdonald, the last two requests you have made in that regard I have agreed to. There have been rulings in the past by Presidents that it is not required when the amendments have been circulated in the chamber. In this case the amendments were circulated at least two hours prior to us reaching the conclusion of the bills. So I will not ask the Clerk to read that question again.
