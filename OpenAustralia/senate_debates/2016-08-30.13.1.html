        I further advise that Senator Urquhart has been elected to serve as Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate—making it almost an entirely Tasmanian lock-in!—and Senators Bilyk and

           I wish to congratulate all senators on their appointments, and to acknowledge and thank particularly former senator

            Anne McEwen
           </a>
           and Senator Moore for their outstanding service as Chief Opposition Whip and Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, respectively, during the last parliament.

           , obviously the opposition would have preferred to have found ourselves on the other side of the chamber in the 45th Parliament; however, we return to this Senate ready to continue to hold this government to account, and we look forward to participating in robust debate and applying forensic scrutiny as we hold the executive to account.
          </p>
          <p>
           I congratulate government senators who have been appointed to parliamentary positions and particularly congratulate those who have been appointed to the executive. It is an enormous privilege to serve as a minister of the Crown for the

            Commonwealth of Australia
