          Askew
         </a>
         for her question. Tomorrow is

          International Day
         </a>
         of People with Disability. Tomorrow, we recognise the contributions and achievements of the 4.4 million Australians who live with disabilities across our nation. I particularly acknowledge the impact that the COVID pandemic has had on people with disability, and the extraordinary resilience of people with disability and their families and carers and the way they came together to support each other through this difficult time. I also acknowledge the frontline disability workers, who have demonstrated incredible leadership and courage throughout the pandemic. Whether it be someone taking a person with disability to get that all-important COVID-19 vaccine or the way people changed how they undertook their care arrangements during lockdown, we acknowledge the contributions that all people who have been involved in this space made to help people with disability get through the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is all about making sure that we also encourage people with disability to meet their aspirations, by providing them with opportunities and making sure that they are able to access the rewards so that they can fulfil their full potential. Tomorrow I will be launching Australia's disability strategy for 2021 to 2031. It is a commitment of all levels of government—state and territory, local, and the Commonwealth—to make sure that we understand our role in improving the lives of people who live with disability. This comes on top of more than 3,000 consultations with people with disability, peak bodies, carers, families and academics to make sure that the next national disability strategy—Australia's disability strategy—recognises the need to have a foundation to create generational change, and a society where all people with disability can reach their potential.

            We know that, in anybody's life, a job is a game changer, and that should not be any different for somebody who lives with disability. That's why tomorrow, alongside Australia's disability strategy, I will also be launching the next national disability employment strategy, which is part of our overall strategy to improve the lives of people who live with disability. Our employment strategy is aptly named 'Employ My Ability', and it will be very much focused on the abilities of jobseekers with disability. My goal is to make sure that we give people with disability access to the full suite of opportunities that every other Australian enjoys. We've consulted widely, and I acknowledge the Disability Employment Advisory Committee. It was chaired by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Alcott" rel="nofollow">
             Dylan Alcott
            </a>
            and Simon McKeon, who have put in an extraordinary amount of work to make sure that our next national disability employment strategy meets the needs of jobseekers who live with disability.

               We're committed to ensuring that people who live with disability have information about policies, programs and supports that are available to them to make sure that they are able to have a life of accessibility. That's why we have invested so strongly in the Disability Gateway, which assists not only people with disability but also their families, carers and the wider community to have a single source of trusted information, advice and referral services. I'm proud of all the work that we have done to support Australians with disability.
              </p>
              <p>
               This year we rolled out the 'I Can' campaign to encourage Australians with disability to make sure that they are accessing the information that we hope will improve their lives. The ad campaign features people who live with disability—they're not actors; they're real people—and it has been a tremendous success. We will continue to work to make sure that we provide people with disability with the same opportunities that every other Australian takes for granted.
