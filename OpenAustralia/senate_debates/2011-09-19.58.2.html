        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. I refer the minister to research released today by the Australian Trade and Industry Alliance which shows that nine out of 10 jobs in Australia's manufacturing sector will face the full impact of the government's carbon tax. Does the minister stand by his statement last week that 'the carbon tax would provide a boost in manufacturing', or does he now accept the statement of Australian steel industry head
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_McDonald" rel="nofollow">

        that 'a new tax is the last thing we need'?

           the fact of the matter, Senator Abetz—the fact of the matter—is that there has been some misleading analysis undertaken by a group of companies that are campaigning against the carbon price. I go to a lot of industry association dinners and to functions—

               I do not have your girlish figure; that is true, Senator. But, Senator, whenever I go to these functions I may well note the official statements that people make but then I speak to individual companies. Individual companies are telling me repeatedly that, while conditions are tough, while circumstances are difficult, the opportunities for new investment are very substantial.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just today I have had people come to my office pointing out that there are many billions of dollars in new investment coming forward irrespective of the changes we are making in regard to climate change and that the companies are very anxious to take advantage of the $20 billion in assistance that the government is providing, in terms of co-investment, which will lead to a very substantive transformation of manufacturing in this country.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I do stand by the statements that I have made. I stand by the fact that we have world-class research facilities in this country; that science and research is providing an enormous opportunity to reinvent companies in this country to develop new products, new industrial processes and new markets. That is the future for manufacturing in this country—an innovative future, a prosperous future for Australian manufacturers.

                carbon tax scheme, compared with Australia, where only nine per cent of people employed in manufacturing are likely to be shielded, doesn't this contradict the government's claims that its carbon tax will not put Australia's international competitiveness at risk?

                   You just have to look at the unemployment numbers. You have to look at the growth numbers in this country. You have to look at the economic security in this country in comparison to what is happening in southern Europe. You only have to look at these things in a cursory way. Of course, with the ignorance peddled by those on the other side, there will not be scrutiny of this because they do not have a policy position of any substance. What they have is an attempt to peddle fear and to suggest that there is no reason for us to be optimistic about the future. The Jobs and Competitiveness Program that the government is providing in the legislation that is before the parliament at the moment will provide support to activities that generate over 80 per cent of the emissions within the manufacturing sector. Eighty per cent of manufacturing activity is covered by these programs.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the government's compensation package will cover only nine per cent of those employed in manufacturing, what assurances can the minister give to the other nearly 900,000 Australians whose jobs will be at risk as a result of this job-destroying tax?

                     I would be only too happy and glad to promote the notion that we are in the business of supporting jobs, of making Australian industries stronger, of making Australia have a more creative and resilient manufacturing sector because of the new investments that will be attracted as a result of the clean energy and efficiency programs that we are pursuing. I will be able to talk to Australian workers about the prospects in the new industries that are opening up in this country and in the transformation of old industries. I will be very confident about the opportunities for Australian workers to enjoy the standard of living that they have a right to expect—opportunities which you were only too happy to take away with your policy, which is about sacking people, about reducing the rights of workers and reducing the economic opportunities for blue-collar workers in this country. We know the hypocrisy, the sham and the crocodile tears that those opposite are peddling, and they will not wash with Australian workers.
