        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister representing the Attorney-General, and it is also about the security of Australian families. I ask the minister: in relation to the excellent government initiative for a Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre in Melbourne, what work has been done on the impact of increasing bushfire danger through climate change? Can the minister say what work has been done on the scourge of the bushfire season, which is arson? Is the research centre looking at the problem of arsonists and what action—

          this is a serious question, Senator—may be taken to detect and prevent arsonists from setting fire to the Australian bush in the coming summer?

           The issue of bushfires is an important one, particularly when you are mindful of the fact that a number of our bushfires are lit by people deliberately. There are of course cases where it is negligence and it is caused by other means. A while ago, I recall taking this up with the states and territories to seek uniform laws for a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
            Criminal Code
           </a>
           offence specifically aimed at bushfires. The question of arson relates primarily to property, buildings and the like, and what we were targeting was the question of where someone is reckless in a park or in the bush—where they behaved with reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions. As I recall, a number of states have implemented specific bushfire offences.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to research on arsonists, I think the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Criminology" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Institute of Criminology
           </a>
           has done a paper on this—I will get back to the Senate about that. As far as the Attorney-General’s portfolio is concerned, we deal with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Emergency Management Australia
           </a>
           in relation to the containment of bushfires, bringing together resources for aerial water bombing. But I take it that Senator Brown is asking a question aimed more at the reasons for arson—those people who go about lighting fires, particularly bushfires, as I understand it. I will get back to the Senate if there is anything more I can advise in relation to this matter.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his considered answer, because the problem with arson is an enormous one here and around the world. Following up on that, I ask the minister: has the government given consideration to lifting the cooperative research centre’s funding so that it may indeed become an international centre for research and action related to bushfires?

             I will take that question on notice and get back to Senator Brown. I do not have a brief in relation to that particular aspect, but I do say that we regard this as a very important issue, especially coming up to the summer months and what is predicted to be a long, hot summer.
