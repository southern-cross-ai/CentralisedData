         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) As
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         Co recently announced publicly, a number of factors have contributed to delays in Gungahlin including the additional nine months it took to finalise the Definitive Agreements between Telstra and NBN Co, along with initial challenges in the company's planning systems integration. However, NBN Co is still aiming to get areas of Gungahlin connected by the end of the year. To achieve this, NBN Co has reprioritised construction plans to connect central Gungahlin (9CRC-03) and parts of Palmerston (9CRC-04) first. This results in moving dates out for other fibre serving area modules in the area.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) As of 17 September 2012, there were 99 active services in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         greenfields sites, covering Macgregor and Watson. As of 17 September 2012, there were 14 active Interim Satellite Services in the ACT. Data is not available on the breakdown of private residences and registered businesses.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) This calculation has not been carried out specifically for the ACT. However, as of May this year NBN Co's analysis showed that overall 38 per cent of active services on the fibre network have been on the fastest speed tier, which is 100/40 megabits per second.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_April" rel="nofollow">
          In April
         </a>
         , this trend was even stronger, with almost 50 per cent of new active services being on the highest speed tier. General information about speeds tiers is available in the NBN Co 2012-15 Corporate Plan on page 64.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) This varies from retail service provider (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSP" rel="nofollow">
          RSP
         </a>
         ) to RSP. This information is available on individual RSP websites. General information about pricing is available in the NBN Co 2012-15 Corporate Plan on pages 58-59.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_Government" rel="nofollow">
          ACT Government
         </a>
         has been successful in applying for grant funding to provide both Digital Enterprise, in partnership with the ACT Business Council, and Digital Hub training services in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Capital Territory
         </a>
         . The delivery of training to individuals and small business by the ACT Government is still in the design phase and services are expected to commence within the next few months for Digital Enterprise and early 2013 for the Digital Hub.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) No. 100 per cent of Australian premises will have access to the NBN.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) Both Corporate Plans are available on the NBN Co website at www.nbnco.com.au.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) The rollout is not readily broken down by state or territory as much of the infrastructure crosses borders and is shared between states; for example the transit network and satellite services. Estimated network rollout costs across the country and across technologies are available in the NBN Co 2012-15 Corporate Plan on page 44.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (9) Anticipated funding is in the NBN Co 2012-15 Corporate Plan which is available on the NBN Co website at www.nbnco.com.au.
