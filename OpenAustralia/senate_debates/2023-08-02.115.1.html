        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. Minister, you have explicitly posted on social media and spoken about your support for a treaty, as has the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        , the Prime Minister and most members of your government. Given the confusion created by the Prime Minister, can you confirm that, if the Voice referendum is successful later this year, the Albanese government will then commence the process to negotiate one or more national treaties with Indigenous Australians?

         I thank those opposite for being so interested in my social media account. I never had any idea! I could just picture you all sitting there, having a look, following everyone's social media. Oh! They wanted some good content. They wanted some quality content. Follow us! We're comfortable with that.

               I will remember Senator Liddle when I post next on social media, hopeful that she'll enjoy it. The focus for the government is on the Voice. There will be a referendum, and everyone will have an opportunity to vote. Our focus is on ensuring that we're closing the gap, focusing on Indigenous health, education, housing and jobs and making a practical difference. I think there is surely some agreement across this chamber that in a number of areas the current situation, the status quo, is not delivering the outcomes that any single one of us in this chamber would want to see continue for any time longer. That is in areas such as incarceration, children being placed in out-of-home care, babies with low birth weight and children being assessed as not on track developmentally. In all of those areas we are not seeing the outcomes that we want to see, which is why there will be—

                     Minister, will you rule out Australian taxpayers being required to pay rent or reparations as part of any treaty negotiated by the Albanese government? If not, what is the potential cost of such a treaty? Have you done the modelling?

                        I can say, as Minister for Finance, one of the things that worries me greatly is the expenditure that's currently going to deliver outcomes that none of us in this place would want to see continue. We spend billions and billions of dollars every year, year on year, on programs that have not shifted the dial and have not closed the gap. As Minister for Finance, I have a responsibility to taxpayers to ensure that the money being spent is delivering outcomes. That is why we are supporting a Voice through the 'yes' vote, when it comes—because we want to see a practical difference and see those outcomes change.

I thought we had unanimous agreement that we wanted to see progress in all these areas. I thought that. We have seen years and years of the parliament working together to make decisions.
