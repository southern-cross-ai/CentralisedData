         The Minister for Human Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Centrelink contracted with Ms S Foster of Sutton for $10 000 of 'cosmetic services' between June 2010 and June 2011 as per contract notice 351334.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Centrelink produces professionally-produced video content to inform and educate the community about essential government payments and services through Front-of-House video played in Centrelink Customer Service Centre waiting areas. Centrelink also produces training videos,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" rel="nofollow">
          DVD
         </a>
         s and Video on Demand packages for staff. For major productions, individuals are provided with appearance preparation services appropriate for filming purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i) The supplier provided appearance preparation services for officers required to be filmed for official purposes, and operated autocue for recordings.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii) Centrelink does not have professional camera, audio or appearance/autocue personnel on staff. These services are contracted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (iii) Various Centrelink and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHS" rel="nofollow">
          DHS
         </a>
         staff involved in production and on-camera work.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (iv) The procurement method was indicated incorrectly in AusTender as an Open Tender. The correct method of procurement was Direct Source. The AusTender record was amended on 21st June 2011 to reflect the correct procurement method. In line with normal practice for procurements under $80,000, the procurement was conducted through sourcing quotes from the only two suppliers that can supply the full range of services in the Canberra region.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (v) An open procurement method was not used.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (vi) There was no Request for Tender.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (vii) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (viii) $7,880.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ix) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) These services were supplied as per contract notice 351334, therefore the questions listed under part (b) of the Senator's question have not been answered.
