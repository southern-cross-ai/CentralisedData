        My question is to Senator Carr, the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Given so many travellers were recently left stranded in airports and the failure of airlines to notify them beforehand of the cancellation of flights in and out of Melbourne, can the minister tell the chamber what time the relevant government agencies advised the airlines of the approaching ash cloud and the nature of this advice?

         , I am not able to assist you in this regard to the precise times at which the government advised the airlines. This is a question that is the responsibility of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Civil Aviation Safety Authority
         </a>
         . They have advised airlines that they are able to operate in accordance with their safety management systems, and plans to avoid forecast and actual areas of volcanic ash were provided. But I do not have the precise time at which that was done. What we have seen is that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
          CASA
         </a>
         's actions in this event would be consistent with those of the civil aviation authorities in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         .
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Airservices Australia
         </a>
         and CASA have both been monitoring the large volcanic ash plume, with the assistance of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
          Bureau of Meteorology
         </a>
         volcanic ash advisory centres. Australia does not generally close airspace for events of this type, and procedures adopted by Australia focused on ash avoid­ance, as most aviation bodies internationally have done. Our actions are quite consistent with international best practice. Procedures to accommodate the avoidance of ash have been established by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
          International Civil Aviation Organisation
         </a>
         , which defines the responsibilities of member states, and Australia has met those responsibilities to the full.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I am hoping that the minister can take the first question on notice as he was unable to answer at this time. Given the availability of technology such as mobile phones and the internet and given how easy it would have been for airlines to notify passengers that their flights were cancelled before they headed out to the airport, has the minister spoken to any of the airline chiefs about why this action was not taken?

           I do not have any advice as to what action the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has taken in regard to direct discussions with the airlines. If there are matters I can enlighten him on I will provide that information to the Senate.

            , I ask a further supplementary question—and I would also like the minister to take the first two questions on notice because he was unable to answer them. Given that another ash cloud is now over

             New Zealand

            and flights between Melbourne and New Zealand have today been cancelled, is the government aware of any expectation of more cancellations in coming days and, if so, when will the public be notified so they can make alternative arrangements?

             Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre. That practice will remain. The minister does not individually make choices of these types. He will have to rely upon expert advice of the relevant authorities. That is the approach that has been taken, consistent with international action. As to whether the minister has spoken to the
