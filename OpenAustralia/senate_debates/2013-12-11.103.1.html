             Australian Greens
            </a>
            have just voted together to seek to deny the will of the Australian people as expressed at the last election. There could not have been a clearer policy proposition by any party at the last election than the explicit and often repeated commitment by the coalition to abolish the carbon tax—which, as you know, Mr Deputy President, was introduced by the former government in direct breach of a solemn commitment given at an election. The plan of those opposite has been clear all week, and that has been to delay, delay, delay—to put speaker after speaker after speaker, repeating the same lines over and over again, to deny the opportunity to get all 11 bills to a vote.

             The Senate

            should sit until such time as the package of bills is dealt with. That is what this motion was for. I acknowledge Senator Xenophon sitting on the correct side of the chamber for this vote.

              <p>
               Earlier this week we accepted on this side that we would support the government's sitting pattern. When we indicated that support, we said that we would not be inclined to accept submissions for extra hours. Over the last fortnight there has been no urgency—no request until the last minute to come in here on the Wednesday and say, 'We want to have extra hours.' The government had adequate time to put in place times to meet their requirements. They did not. We did not return to this place until very late. We had a short period.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
                The Senate
               </a>
               is doing what it always does: it considers the business in front of us. Every senator has the right to make a contribution on legislation. That is what the Senate does. We will continue to consider legislation as it comes before us. We will do our job. That is the role of the Senate. If there was such urgency, there should have been some discussion earlier. There was not. We do not accept the proposition for extra hours.
