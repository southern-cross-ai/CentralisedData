        My question is to the minister currently representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Sky News has reported that Liberal members of parliament were concerned they wouldn't get all the money they wanted from the government's corrupt sports rorts program, and the federal Liberal Party director assured him he would get onto it. What role did the federal Liberal Party play in the awarding of grants under the corrupt sports rorts program?

         I thank Senator Green for that question. I completely reject the premise of the question. The sports grants program is a very popular and highly successful program where there was more demand than available resources. Minister
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie" rel="nofollow">
          McKenzie
         </a>
         , in reviewing the recommendations made by Sport Australia, made sure that electorates represented by the Labor Party received a fair share of the grants that were available. If Minister McKenzie had not employed her discretion and made judgements, the allocation of funding would have been more inappropriate. I think that is a matter of public record; I have said that on a number of occasions now. I have not personally been involved in the decisions in relation to those projects. Obviously, and appropriately, that was a matter for the minister for sports. That is really all there is to it.

            I am not aware that Mr Hirst was involved. I am not in the habit of commenting on anonymous quotesâ€”if indeed it is an accurate quote. Furthermore, the Prime Minister has been very clear on the public record in relation to his involvement and the involvement of his office. I have also made clear statements in relation to these matters, and I refer you to those previous statements.
