        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Chris Evans. On 22 January Minister Macklin publicly released to Clubs

        her offer for a trial of mandatory precommitment in the ACT. On 27 January, following media inquiries to the minister's office about the conflict of interest of giving money to Labor clubs in the ACT, urgent advice on this was sought from Oakton consulting. What is the overall cost of the ACT poker machine trial, and how will the government ensure there is no conflict of interest involved in Labor- and union-connected clubs receiving $725,000 in monthly incentives, or around 25 per cent of the moneys earmarked for this trial, according to information I received under

         I suppose the first point to make is that I do not take advice from those who take money from big tobacco about the principles that ought to apply to moral judgements about where one takes one's donations from. So I want to make it clear that the outrage expressed in the question bears no scrutiny. We have a system where any donations to political parties are made public through proper declarations through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
          AEC

         The senator would know that today we have introduced into the parliament the first national legislation to tackle problem gambling, which includes a staged, evidence-based pathway to precommitment. We know of course that, while gambling is enjoyed by many Australians in moderation and is a legitimate industry, it is also the case that we have a large number of people who suffer from gambling addiction and that that addiction causes great pain to them and their families.

Perhaps I could assist you by tabling folio 45 from material that I received under freedom of information, which may assist you in answering my question. I seek leave to table that document.

            The senator well knows the courtesies that are observed before seeking to table documents in this place, a lesson that was reinforced to us by Senator Heffernan's behaviour over an incident we all remember. If the senator were serious about seeking to table that matter, she could show it to our manager and whip under the normal procedures and the courtesies we are all supposed to show to each other. I do not currently have a briefing on folio 45 of the senator's

                  , I ask a second supplementary question. I refer to the

                  decision letter to me of 28 May which also argued that the Oakton advice should not be released on public interest grounds. Now that the legislation is before the parliament, Minister, will the government release Oakton's advice? What could be the public interest against the release of advice which will show how the government should deal with its gross conflict of interest?

                    In the argument put in that supposed second supplementary question the senator answered her own question by saying that the proper processes had apparently led to a result that she did not like. I am sorry, Senator, I grieve for you. You used the proper processes, you got a result that was in accordance with those proper processes and you do not like the result. I have been a Dockers member for many years. We have not had many good results, but I just have to suck it up, because that is the way it goes. So, Senator, if you are unhappy with the
