         The bushfire seasonal outlook for spring, which was released by AFAC last month, is certainly starting to eventuate. We've seen increased fire activity across the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

         </a>

          New South Wales
         </a>
         over the past week, which serves as a reminder that the higher-risk weather season is now upon us. At the national level, we've made a number of changes since
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Summer" rel="nofollow">
          Black Summer
         </a>
         â€”to be better prepared and to make sure that people are as safe as possible. There's now a new fire-danger-rating system to explain to people more clearly the level of risk that they face; we're investing more in mitigation and resilience than any government has ever done; and we have an extra-large water bomber plane, in addition to more large helicopters to do dumps of water.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are working closely with the state and territory governments, and I know that they're increasing their fuel-reduction activity where it's safe to do so. Particularly for some of those in New South Wales, the smoke they're experiencing around Sydney from prescribed burns at the moment may bring back memories of the Black Summer fires so, given that today is R U

         In two weeks time, the Albanese government will be hosting the first-ever National Bushfire Preparedness Summit here in Canberra, bringing together personnel from state and territory governments, emergency services, industry and not-for-profit organisations to share resources and practice national-level coordination and exercises. This is on top of the usual high-risk weather season planning, which involves a range of exercises and briefings across all states and territories and with key stakeholder groups, including media,

        </p>
        <p>
         We have been planning for this coming season for months now, and we're committed to supporting the states and territories in their planning and preparedness for the months ahead.

           Thank you for the update, Minister. It's clear that all Australians must prepare for a difficult natural disaster season. In last week alone, we've seen bushfires threaten communities in the Barkly region and I know that the Commonwealth has been working closely with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory

           government to provide support in the response and immediate recovery. Can the minister please update the Senate on what exactly is being done to support the Northern Territory in their response to these bushfires?

               In addition to using the latest technology to fight fires, Australia's fire services are increasingly listening to the traditional burning practices of our First People to help with preparedness. Yesterday I joined

               and Caring for Country staff, and I was very pleased to meet Ngunnawal traditional custodian Brad Bell and his family and learn more about the role that Indigenous knowledge and cultural burning is playing in our fire preparation seasons. Cold burning is increasingly being used to prepare land for bushfires and reduce the fuel load which could burn if a fire came through. Brad was passionate about the joy that he and his family get from being able to share some of the knowledge that their ancestors have had for thousands of years and that we as communities can learn about and apply in order to better prepare ourselves for fire seasons. Brad spoke about reducing water use by applying Indigenous techniques like cultural burning as well as the benefits to land management. It's a practical example of what we get when we listen to our Indigenous people to deliver better results.
