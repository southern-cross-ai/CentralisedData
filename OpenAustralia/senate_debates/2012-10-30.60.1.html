        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the coalition questioning about AusAID funding paid via
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">
         World Vision
        </a>

        , an organisation which has been accused of having links with a proscribed terrorist organisation, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front" rel="nofollow">
         Popular Front
        </a>
        for the Liberation of Palestine. In particular, I refer to the minister's insistence that the Union of Agricultural Work Committees is benign because it is registered in Israel as a not-for-profit organisation. Will the minister today abide by his undertaking to the Senate of 23 August, 68 days ago, to expeditiously say who provided this registration renewal to the government?

         The answer is yes. I have in my hands all the translations of the relevant documents. The documents were translated, among others, by Russell D. Mayer, a notary at Jerusalem Malcha Technology Park, who serves in the Israeli defence forces part-time.

             It is very appropriate that the interjection comes from Senator Kroger—underline the name. These allegations first surfaced from the body

              , I rise on a point of order. Sometimes people say that you appear to lack authority. In the other chamber, someone was accused of being discourteous by turning their back to Ms Roxon, I think it was. This speaker continuously turns his back to you, Mr President, and it undermines your authority. I would ask you to direct him to address the chair and to address his remarks through you, as every other senator is required to do.

                 , I rise a point of order. There is a requirement that answers be directly relevant. Trying to drag senators' children into it is not exactly being directly relevant, let alone it being extremely untidy. But, apart from that, the question was very specific: who provided the registration renewal to the government? We have since had affidavits and a translation provided to the committee but not the answer as to who initially provided the registration renewal to the government. That is the only information that is being sought, not family histories.

                      , but at the request of the Israeli authorities was asked to register it in the name the Committee of Agricultural Works. The question of translation is resolved by this. The translation we have used comes from a lawyer—a professional of 30 years, a pillar of the community and in his spare time a volunteer patrolman with the rank of master sergeant. The affidavit, made by the

                      , makes very clear why there was that discrepancy in names. It was at the request of the government of Israel, which has not declared this organisation a terrorist organisation, which allows it to register and operate under Israeli law. It is not proscribed by the government of Israel. That is your difficulty in this one. No matter how many postcards the boys send home to mum, that remains the fact.
