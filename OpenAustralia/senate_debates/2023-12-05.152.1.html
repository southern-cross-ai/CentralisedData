        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Overnight, the Israeli government raised the travel warning for Jewish citizens travelling to a number of countries, including Australia, to level 2, 'Potential threat', referencing the increase in hostility to Israelis and Jewish citizens and recommending that those staying in this country exercise increased precaution—a point that I note the minister didn't reference in response to a previous question today. Will the Prime Minister now accept the opposition leader's recommendation that National Cabinet identify and commit to practical measures to ensure the safety of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Jewish Australians
        </a>
        ? Will the Prime Minister commit to seeking to secure a statement from tomorrow's National Cabinet in which the leaders of the Commonwealth and all states and territories confirm their support for Australia's Jewish community and condemn antisemitism in all its forms?

         I'd refer Senator Chandler to the first question I took from the government in this place, which was precisely about antisemitism. It might be well for us all to remember that this is not an issue of partisanship; this is an issue of making sure that, from this place, we send a very clear message that all forms of prejudice and discrimination are to be condemned, that we work always for acceptance, respect and unity, that we condemn prejudice wherever we see it and that we condemn antisemitism just as we condemn all forms of prejudice, including Islamophobia and prejudice against other groups in society—prejudice against people for who they are.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would note that Israel has taken a decision to raise its warnings for a number of countries. Australia is one of them, but those countries also include the United Kingdom, Germany, France and others. I will check the others, but I certainly know of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         , Germany and France. We obviously want Australia to be a welcoming place for visitors. I think you would have heard in my first answer, and in many other things we have said, that there is no place for antisemitism in Australia and we must make sure it does not find a foothold here. I can certainly say that we will always denounce it and reject it utterly, just as we do all forms of racism and prejudice. I would say to the senator: I know Mr Dutton has made certain comments. I also see Senator Birmingham has made comments. This is not a partisan issue. This is actually an issue on which we should stand united.

           Minister, at a level 2 threat, the Israeli government is recommending Israelis in Australia take action, including shortening their stays to the bare minimum and avoiding openly displaying signs of their Israeli identity. When was the last time the Israeli government formally and officially advised Jews and Israelis to hide their identities whilst in Australia?

            What I would say is that I never want anyone to have to hide who they are. I don't want any person of Jewish faith to have to hide who they are. I don't want someone who's gay or trans to have to hide who they are. I don't want anyone who's Muslim to have to hide who they are. I don't want anyone in this country to have to hide who they are in order to be safe, and I would hope, Senator Chandler, that you would agree. I refer to my earlier answer.

               We have been very clear and utterly unequivocal in our condemnation of antisemitism, of all prejudice. You have heard me here in this place and elsewhere, over and over again, talk about the need for unity, the need to ensure that the distress in our community does not become anger, does not become hatred and does not become violence. And I would welcome you making the same sorts of comments, Senator Chandler, because there are views in this chamber that are very different. There are people in this chamber who have very strong views about the Palestinian communities. There are people in this chamber who have very strong views about Jewish communities. But we all need to stand against division.
