        I seek leave to incorporate a valedictory speech from Senator John Watson. It was in the chamber last evening but was not incorporated.

        Leave granted.

          The incorporated speech read as follows—
         </i>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is a rare event to farewell a retiring Senator who has served more than twelve years here but is leaving us still short of her fortieth birthday, but this week we must do this for Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         When Senator Stott-Despoja arrived here at the tender age of just 26, she reminded me of my own daughter Fiona.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The blond hair, bright as a button, full of vim and vigour and passion to make a mark on this country, she was a shot of enthusiasm not always common in Senators, new or old.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Natasha also displayed a characteristic common to many politicians—she was hard-nosed and ambitious and energetic in her public image, but in private she had a heart-of-gold and was as kind and generous as anyone here.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I remember her kind gift of a chocolate bilby at Easter this year—a small and thoughtful gift I would not expect to have come from anyone other than Natasha.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I also recall the many brief messages on many topics which showed that Natasha cared not only for her own political colleagues, but also for other’s interests and issues.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Just last week she emailed me a brief five word message which read: “I enjoyed your interview John.”
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We both knew that she was referring to an interview that had been broadcast the previous Friday on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Radio_National" rel="nofollow">
          ABC Radio National
         </a>
         , but the brief message showed that she had listened to it, and had the kindness to indicate that she enjoyed it.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It was a small but meaningful example of Natasha showing that she cared for the feelings of others, including her political opponents.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Perhaps the arrival of motherhood has also brought Natasha into a new world where abrasive politics is less comfortable a personality trait than the more caring and considerate image related to motherhood.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But this underlying caring image does not reduce the stirring activist role in politics which has characterised much of Senator Stott-Despoja’s career as a Senator.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Challenges have been taken on in areas such as women’s rights, young people’s issues, education, a wide range of social concerns, and matters related to the efficient operation of the parliament as a vital element of our democracy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I must admit that many here wondered what we had been given when Natasha Stott-Despoja first arrived in the Senate.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         She arrived with the enthusiasm of youth in full bloom, and some of my more conservative colleagues were a little taken aback to say the least.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But it is essential that youth and youthful ideas are allowed free expression when they are passionately held and when they are expressed as eloquently as Natasha was keen to do, especially in her first years here.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Natasha has continued to confront issues head-on as we would expect a bright, young, intelligent person to do, and her influence has spread widely because of the enthusiasm she has shown and the resolve with which she has pursued her goals.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         During her time in the Senate, she has continued to mature in her approach to the parliamentary process and has spent nearly five years as either Deputy Leader or Leader of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Democrats" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Democrats
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         She has also carried out her committee responsibilities with dedication and thoughtful application.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         While she pursued causes, Senator Stott-Despoja also took her formal parliamentary duties very seriously, and as a result, her influence has been considerable.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Her lively contributions to debate and enthusiasm to bring a fresh perspective to old issues will be sadly missed here.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To Natasha and her family, my best wishes for a long and happy life after the Senate, and my sincere thanks for your friendship and your passionate and sincere contribution to the work of the Senate.
