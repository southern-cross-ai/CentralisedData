        Australians have a unique sense of pride about their jobs. We are proud workers. Labor cares about jobs, and an Albanese Labor government will invest in the future of secure Tasmanian jobs and manufacturing by helping to kickstart
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Hydrogen's George Town project. LINE Hydrogen is working to deliver Australia's first operational commercial-scale hydrogen facility. This commitment will mean LINE Hydrogen will invest in green hydrogen production and co-locate with solar farms to replace diesel in Tasmanian trucks and buses. Not only will this project be great for the creation of jobs; it will move Northern Tasmania in the right direction in terms of renewable energy and climate action. Labor's investment will support around $80 million in private investment in the first stage of the project. When fully operational, the project will be valued at $300 million once stage 3 is complete. Labor will work with both the Tasmanian government and TasNetworks to finalise and deliver this commitment—another big win for Northern Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, Labor is committed to ensuring Australian manufacturing is restarted. Labor will invest a further $5 million to create jobs and ensure Tasmania is a state that makes things now and into the future. This vision includes both the production of hydrogen and up to 30 hydrogen truck buses that will be leased to industrial partners. Over time, LINE could also build at least five hydrogen refuelling stations across Tasmania. The project will create 215 direct and downstream jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor is committed to securing well-paid jobs and delivering for Tasmania, and delivering on Tasmania's and Labor's commitment to renewable energy. Over the last nine years of the Liberal government, we saw 85,000 manufacturing jobs lost in this country. They have no credible record at all when it comes to supporting manufacturing in this country. LINE Hydrogen is a fantastic project. It's fantastic for Tasmania, and I'm proud to be part of the Albanese Labor government—
