          <p>
           I just want to speak briefly to these. This morning we talked about judicial review, or the review associated with decisions made by the minister under this bill.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
            The Senate
           </a>
           has declined to include an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
            AAT
           </a>
           review process. So what these amendments together seek to do is to remove the prohibition in the bill for a review under the Administrative Decisions (
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Review" rel="nofollow">
            Judicial Review
           </a>
           ) Act and to require the minister to provide reasons for a decision. I just want to talk very briefly about that. The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act does not permit a merits review, which I think is one of the things that the minister is seeking to avoid—a discussion about the merits of a particular policy decision. Section 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act sets out the sorts of questions that can be brought before a court in relation to a decision, and they are things like:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (a) that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision;
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (b) that procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the making of the decision were not observed;
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           …   …   …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (g) that the decision was induced or affected by fraud;
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (h) that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision …
          </p>
          <p>
           Those are just several of the questions that can be put before a court. They are questions of law, not going to the merits of any particular decision.
          </p>
          <p>
           So this is trying to find the balance and not overload the AAT with matters that typically would be initiated by fairly significant litigants—shire councils, state governments or universities. The AAT is more of a place for individual litigants who want to take on the government in respect of a decision that has been made about them personally. That's typically what happens in the AAT. But this does bring the level up to a court. That in itself will filter out the number of applications likely to be made.
          </p>
          <p>
           An important part of that review process is that the minister is required to provide a decision. Now, it's generally accepted in administrative decision-making that decision-makers who are required to write down and set out the reasons generally make a better decision. But there are other reasons why people should be provided with reasons. In these circumstances, the minister may make a decision about an organisation, and that organisation may, in a sense, be aggrieved by the minister's decision. They've got a no on something—they're being prohibited from doing something, or something has been overturned—and they never get to understand why. That's one of the reasons why administrative decisions normally are accompanied with reasons, and that's so that the aggrieved party can have a look at those reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
           The third reason why it's important to have reasons made available—the first being so better decisions are made and the second being so the aggrieved party can see what the justification is—is that it actually provides a mechanism to initiate a judicial review of some sort. You can see what the minister has or has not done, and you can perhaps bring that to the attention of a court. The fourth reason is that in general, with any administrative decision, we like to see consistency in government. We like to see predictability in government. And if we have a number of decisions that are available for people to see, for people to understand and comprehend, then it allows others in the community to understand whether or not the actions they might be considering taking would fall foul of the minister's intent or not. So it is important to provide reasons, and it's for that reason I would encourage the Senate to vote for the amendments that I have put.

            Just to clarify in relation to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD" rel="nofollow">
             AD
            </a>
            (
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JR" rel="nofollow">
             JR
            </a>
            ) Act, which we went through in part earlier today, the government does not support these amendments, one of the reasons for that being the requirement to provide reasons. We also believe that there is substantial overlap between the scope of judicial review under the AD(JR) Act and the Constitution itself. That is the common law which is already available, of course, and the grounds for judicial review under the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Judiciary Act
            </a>
            and the AD(JR) Act.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government is of the view that judicial review remains available under the foreign relations bill, as we have already discussed, by the Federal Circuit Court, under the Judiciary Act, and by the High Court, under the Constitution. And, like the AD(JR) Act, these avenues of review do allow a court to do several things, including setting aside a decision that has been unlawfully made, requiring the performance of what a decision-maker has failed to perform, ceasing proceedings where a decision-maker has failed to exercise their powers properly, and granting an injunction to prevent or require certain actions. So we do think the judicial review mechanism in the bill is appropriate. There are comparable schemes which also exclude the AD(JR) Act review on the basis that those schemes are ones which involve complex political considerations. That includes the FIRB; it includes, as I said earlier, certain decisions under the Passports Act, extradition and prisoner transfer arrangements; and it includes a range of other decisions relating to intelligence and national security, to taxation, to corporations and to charities.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think it is appropriate to replace the foreign minister as the decision-maker on foreign policy and foreign relations with a merits review. These are the remit of the federal government. They draw from federal government expertise. We oppose these amendments.

              I'm just going to explain what we're doing. I'm sure the whips are across it. The first question I am going to put is that item 1 of schedule 1 stand as printed. That is a reference back to amendment (1) on sheet 1152. These are being moved by Senator Patrick. The second part of that, after we've voted on that, will be amendment (2) on sheet 1151. The third piece that Senator Patrick has moved is amendment (1) on sheet 1151. So the question is that item 1 of schedule 1 stand as printed.

               Before I put the question, I'll just explain that we are dealing with amendment (1) on sheet 1151, as moved by Senator Patrick, and amendment (1) on sheet 1152. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.
