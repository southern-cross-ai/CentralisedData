           The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement negotiations are at an advanced stage and only the most difficult issues remain. Australia is working hard to conclude negotiations as soon as possible; however, we will not sacrifice a comprehensive, ambitious

            TPP
           </a>
           outcome in order to obtain a quick deal.
          </p>
          <p>
           TPP countries, including Canada, Mexico and Japan, accounted for a third of Australia's total trade in 2012-13.
          </p>
          <p>
           The 12 TPP parties have agreed to keep the negotiating documents, including the text, confidential. Pre-emptive and unilateral release of such confidential information would damage Australia's standing as a negotiating partner. Australia will be in a position to publicly release the text when all parties agree to do so, not before.

           can be assured that, once the text of trade agreements is ratified between parties but before it is ratified by the Australian government, it will be made public and it will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the well-established review processes through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.
          </p>

            We do not necessarily support the wording of this motion, but we do support the intent to actually get debate in this chamber and some transparency around what is the biggest trade deal in this country's history, totally negotiated in secret, behind closed doors, and pushed by special interests in both the

             US

            and other countries around this region. It is totally unacceptable to Australians in this country that a trade agreement that will change the laws in this country, that will impact on significant matters of public interest, is being negotiated behind closed doors by

            officials where only one or two senior ministers on this government's front bench know the details of this deal. This is a huge issue around the world. It is in the US, as it is in Europe. The

            has recently voted to give the text to the public before it is signed. This will be signed by cabinet. Parliament will not be able to change it. You vote for or against it. It is simply unacceptable and the Australian public are starting to make their voice heard.
