        (a) the need for national law reform surrounding evidence relating to child sex abuse, specifically looking at the role federal laws could play in requiring documents relating to child abuse, particularly child sexual abuse, to be held for a minimum of 30 years;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the need for national law reform to prevent the destruction and concealment of documents which should be retained in the public interest, including documents in relation to potential legal proceedings;

       <p class="italic">
        (c) the circumstances under which documents should be categorised as Cabinet in Confidence;

        (e) in relation to events relating to allegations of abuse in the John Oxley Youth Detention Centre in Queensland from 1988:

           The government does not support this motion. The government notes that this is the second time this year that Senator Xenophon has sought the Senate's intervention in this matter, which arose out of incidents that occurred at the John Oxley Youth Detention Centre in 1988.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
            The Senate
           </a>
           has inquired into these matters to the limits of its jurisdiction in four substantial inquiries stretching over more than a decade. In all of these inquiries the Senate committees were unable to find evidence to substantiate the numerous allegations.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are undoubtedly matters of concern in these events. The main question that should be asked is what jurisdiction does the Senate have to achieve any justice for any of the victims now and what can the Senate do now that it has not already done. For those reasons the government does not support the motion.

              The previous inquiries related to horrendous events that occurred at the John Oxley Youth Detention Centre back in 1988 when a 14-year-old girl was gang raped. There was a cover-up of what occurred and a shredding of documents. There have been previous inquiries but at none of those inquiries was the victim at the centre of these allegations ever given an opportunity to appear. This woman has approached my office and she is desperate to give evidence to set the record straight so that there can be some finality to what occurred.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are fundamental issues of law reform here. Senator Ludwig is wrong in relation to this. There are issues in terms of the destruction of documents, in terms of legal proceedings and in terms of federal law reform in dealing with documents in relation to child sexual abuse so that there can be a national uniform approach. There are a number of fundamental aspects of law reform that need to be dealt with, and the victim wants to come forward so that the record can be set straight once and for all.
