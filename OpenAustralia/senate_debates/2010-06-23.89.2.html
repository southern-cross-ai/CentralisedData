       <p class="italic">
        The bill will ensure that Australia Post can continue to deliver pharmaceuticals under the “RFDS Medical Chest Program”, enabling emergency treatment to be given to people in rural and remote areas of Australia.  It will also enable this protection to be extended to other prescribed persons or bodies who are supplying medicines to remote communities under a prescribed program of a similar nature.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will have retrospective effect to ensure that Australia Post, the RFDS and other prescribed bodies and persons will not be prosecuted for earlier breaches of section 85W.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is an urgent need to allow the RFDS to resume the supply of medicines through Australia Post for the Medical Chest Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The RFDS and its agents currently supply and maintain approximately 2,600 Medical Chests across Australia.  Since the discovery of this issue, a high proportion of those in remote areas are depleted or carrying out of date stock.  While the RFDS has adopted the practice of inviting people to travel to a RFDS base and collect resupplies, some locations are too remote for this.  There are no viable alternatives to Australia Post for supplying medicines for the RFDS Medicine Chest Program, as Australia Post is the only delivery provider servicing many remote locations.

        has also become aware that other organisations and programs may require coverage by an exception to the offence.  An urgent amendment will address the risk of emergency medicines not being available to treat serious illness or injury in rural and remote areas of Australia, both under the RFDS’ Medical Chest Program, and programs of a similar nature that may be prescribed in Regulations.

       <p class="italic">
        This reform was agreed to by COAG on 3 July 2008 for implementation by December 2008. Due to the need to resolve some complex issues regarding implementation of this reform, its completion is now overdue. It should be considered urgent as additional delay will create disadvantage for primary producers, who may be in the position of lawfully using a chemical product on their crops or livestock, only to find they are unable to legally sell the produce (plant and animal products) because there is no corresponding maximum residue limit in the Food Standards Code. Every day that the reform is delayed comes at a financial cost to primary producers.

         SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY (SUPERVISION) AMENDMENT BILL 2010

        <b>
         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIS" rel="nofollow">
         SIS
        </a>
        Act) to address prudential risks associated with superannuation fund investment in limited recourse borrowing arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The market for products allowing for superannuation fund investment in limited recourse borrowing arrangements has evolved rapidly since amendments to the SIS Act in 2007 permitted these products.  Uncertainty in the interpretation of the law is allowing product issuers to develop products based on their interpretation, leading to products that impose undesirable conditions that expose fund assets to excessive risk.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the legislation was introduced in 2007, industry stakeholders have been expecting legislative amendments to clarify several points of ambiguity existing in this area.  Industry stakeholders have reiterated this need through the confidential consultation process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Introduction and passage of the Bill will reduce the risks for superannuation funds investing in limited recourse borrowing arrangements.  Further, it will limit the opportunity for providers to use the delay between introduction and enactment of the Bill to develop products that exploit the issues the Bill is to address.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers the amendments contained in this Bill require urgent enactment to protect superannuation fund members from excessively risky products and to provide certainty for issuers of limited recourse borrowing arrangements as to the circumstances under which they can offer these products.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         World Bank
        </a>
        ) and makes provisions which allow Australia to meet obligations that may arise by virtue of our membership of these institutions. The current New Arrangements to Borrow (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAB" rel="nofollow">
         NAB
        </a>
        ) Decision, dated 27 January 1997, forms Schedule 4 to the Act. This bill proposes an amendment to the IMA Act, including Schedule 4 of the Act, to reflect amendments to the NAB Decision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NAB is a voluntary set of credit arrangements between the IMF and a number of its members, including Australia.  The NAB can be activated by participants in order to supplement the IMF’s lending resources when they consider it necessary.  The NAB acts as a backstop arrangement where the IMF’s usual quota processes are insufficient to meet the needs of borrowing member countries. In the event of the IMF drawing on the NAB, the funds would be repaid to Australia in full, with interest.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed amendments to the NAB will allow Australia to contribute to implementation of a G20 Leaders’ commitment, which will ensure that the IMF has the resources necessary to credibly support its members, thereby promoting global confidence and economic recovery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 2 April 2009, G20 Leaders committed to an expanded NAB, increased to up to US$550 billion. There was subsequently strong interest from new potential participants, including those outside the G20, and on 24 November 2009 the IMF announced that participants had agreed to expand the NAB to up to US$600 billion. The amendments to the Schedule would authorise the proposed increase in Australia’s existing line of credit under the NAB from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDR" rel="nofollow">
         SDR
        </a>
        801 million (around A$1.4 billion) to  SDR 4370 million (around A$7.5 billion) under the current appropriation in the IMA Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        G20 Leaders also committed to a more flexible NAB.  This will better support the Fund in providing substantial financing to its members at short notice, especially during times of crisis.  Flexibility will be achieved by amending the terms of the arrangement to implement a more streamlined procedure to activate the NAB. The terms of the current NAB state that the NAB may only be activated on a loan-by-loan basis. The proposed changes will modify the NAB to allow a general activation for a defined period subject to a maximum level of commitments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The expanded and more flexible New Arrangements to Borrow is a part of the G20 Leaders’ global plan for recovery and reform agreed on 2 April 2009 in London.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the conclusion of a process of international negotiations, the proposed amendments to expand and make more flexible the current NAB Decision were adopted by the IMF Executive Board on 12 April 2010.  For the amended NAB to enter into effect, its participants will be required to accept the amendments to the NAB Decision; some participants will be required to implement the amendments through domestic legislation change, including Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Urgent implementation of NAB is prudent, particularly in light of the tentative global recovery, as it will support confidence in the markets that the IMF has a credible backstop to its quota resources, and is able to support its members should there be a need.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill gives effect to a number of recommendations of a Review Panel appointed to review the Insurance Contracts Act 1984.  The changes are largely technical in nature and respond to market developments and judicial decisions since its enactment.  The Bill will streamline requirements and address anomalies in the regulatory framework for the benefit of insurers and consumers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures have been subject to stakeholder consultation and in some areas the Review Panel’s recommendations have been modified to take account of issues raised in consultations.

        The improvements in the Bill will streamline processes and correct anomalies that will benefit insurers, insureds and the general public.  In particular, it will remove legal impediments that would otherwise exist to insurers dealing with their customers on-line.  This reform has been long-awaited and is linked to the Electronic Transactions Regulations Amendment (No. 2) 2010.  That regulation has already been made but has a commencement dependent upon commencement of Schedule 2 of the Bill.  Further delays will result in loss of efficiencies that would be generated through commencement of the Bill and associated regulations.

        The proposed pilot is due to commence on 1 July 2010. Legislation to support the pilot requires urgent passage through parliament during the 2010 Winter sittings to ensure the measure can be implemented from this date. If the legislation is not passed in the Winter sittings, the ancillary benefits cannot be guaranteed for the pilot program participants. There is likely to be concern if some farmers receiving the FFS payments in the pilot are not eligible for ancillary benefits.

        It is preferable that this Bill be passed in the Winter sittings as the amendments are to apply in respect of the 2010-11 income year.  This would allow taxpayers and their advisers sufficient time to prepare for the changes effected by the amendments. It would also allow the Australian Taxation Office to put the necessary systems and administrative support in place.

        The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 (the Act) to implement the new Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) Business Model, which forms part of the Government’s broader settlement framework.  The AMEP is the program through which English language tuition is delivered under the Act.  The new AMEP Business Model provides a greater focus on client outcomes with improved program design, as well as improved program delivery and administration.

        An exemption from Senate Standing Order 111 is sought for this Bill to allow it to be introduced in the Senate in this sitting period.  The exemption is necessary as the Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in the Autumn sitting period and, if passed by that House this sitting period, it will not be received by the Senate before the Senate cut off date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill requires introduction and passage through the Senate and the House of Representatives in this sitting period to ensure that the Bill can commence on 1 January 2011, which is the commencement date provided in clause 2 of the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The commencement provision in the Bill is 1 January 2011 to align with the proposed commencement of the new contracts with service providers which will incorporate the new AMEP Business Model.  This is to ensure that the new AMEP Business Model will be implemented in its entirety on the same day.  The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is currently undertaking a tender process in relation to these new contracts to enable the alignment of the commencement of the legislation amendments and proposed new contracts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the Bill is not dealt with before 1 January 2011, aspects of the new AMEP Business Model will be unable to be implemented in line with the new contracts, including key support measures for clients.  These key support measures include the extension of the time frame for clients to register with an approved English course provider from three months to six months.
