        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Today 344 new cases have been reported in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        , and, tragically, there have been a total of 34 deaths during the current outbreak. Yesterday, an experienced respiratory physician at a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney

        hospital issued a stark warning that 'New South Wales is almost certainly on the precipice of a massive deterioration'. Given Mr Morrison has endorsed the New South Wales decision to avoid lockdown, will he now take responsibility for the crisis facing the people of New South Wales?

         I thank Senator O'Neill for her question. The government indeed takes our share of responsibility for working with

         and the people of New South Wales in what is a very difficult and trying time for them. We have ensured that we support the New South Wales government, through the deployment of ADF personnel, to assist them in relation to enforcement activities and compliance activities around the lockdown that is in place, and we have also provided, as is common practice, additional personnel and resources to assist with the contact-tracing effort underway in New South Wales. We have also, where possible, provided additional access to vaccines for the people of New South Wales, particularly in relation to targeting some of those parts of Sydney that are facing some of the greatest stress and pressures. And so we do recognise the need to take responsibility, to work carefully and closely with New South Wales through these very difficult—

           We know these are trying and difficult times. Across the nation, we are seeking to ensure the continued growth in the vaccine rollout occurs and occurs successfully. I welcome the fact that, in the past 24 hours, some 255,964 doses have been administered, yet another daily record demonstrating the gathering of pace in relation to that vaccine rollout, which is now seeing, on a weekly basis, doses administered for roughly the entire population of Adelaide, across the country every single week, and that's with the difficulties the rollout has faced, but we are overcoming those and seeing very clearly its growth and success.

              in relation to providing them support, and encouraging them at times to accept support, in relation to the application of the current lockdown and ensuring its success. In terms of the pathway out of crisis, we have also, for the nation, developed the work that's being released by the Doherty Institute, the type of modelling and work that is world-leading in terms of identifying how it is we can ensure that, as the vaccine rollout continues to progress across the country, we have informed evidence based approaches to be able to reduce the scale, scope or necessity of lockdowns in the future. That is a crucially important piece of work to inform us against the delta strain and the enormous additional challenges that that delta strain poses in New South Wales, as it does in many other parts of the world.

                Khalil from Bankstown tragically lost his parents, 82-year-old Kaoukab and 88-year-old Hachem, to COVID-19 in the same week. His family's bereavement was amplified when they found out that his parents died still waiting to get their vaccinations. People have paid with their lives for Mr Morrison's failure to secure enough vaccines. Isn't it painfully clear that it was always a race—

                 Clearly, I extend my sympathies and the government's sympathies to Khalil and his family and, indeed, all those who have suffered bereavements in Australia—944 through the course of the pandemic—and, of course, the many millions across the rest of the globe. Those comparisons do remain important. Australia, though each of those deaths and each of the challenges of COVID is a tragedy, has managed the pandemic still far better than the rest of the world. In terms of access—
