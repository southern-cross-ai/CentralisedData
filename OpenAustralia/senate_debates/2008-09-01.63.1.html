        </a>
        Parliamentary Program, which gives senators and members the opportunity to join in the activities of the Defence Force through a number of programs. It also gives members of the Defence Force an opportunity to take part in an exchange parliamentary program. The Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program began in 2001 and to date 80 members of parliament have had firsthand experiences of the challenges of service life as well as the opportunity to gain an understanding of how government policy actually works in practice.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year 34 participants—the most we have ever had—will take part in an amazing range of programs and activities. New program options for this year include time with the

        , the Australian Defence Force Academy Border Protection Command in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">

        This evening I would like to speak about the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Exchange Program, which is taking place in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        this week. Fifteen members of the Defence Force are being hosted by senators and members to give them an insight into, and a greater understanding of, the way in which our members of parliament undertake their duties. Those participants from the Navy are Commander Glen Ker, Commander Andrew Schroder, Lieutenant Commander Kirk Hayden, Lieutenant Commander Aaron Nye and Lieutenant Commander Elizabeth Mulder. Those from the Army include Major James Cook, who I am delighted to be able to host, and he is here in the chamber with me this evening. Major Cook is the commanding officer of Centre Squadron,

         by leave—I am pleased to support Senator Adams in congratulating members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force
         </a>
         on the running of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. Senator Adams is a strong supporter in the Senate of participation in this program. I have been very pleased to participate in it myself and I know that many of my colleagues also have been pleased to participate. I know that all of us have had a great deal of value from the program. It is wonderful to see the commitment and professionalism of members of our Defence Force. I suppose we hear about it all the time and we see, in operations both here in Australia and overseas, the success of their endeavours. But after spending time with them day after day and watching them go about their ordinary, everyday work I feel that it is very satisfying that we have such high-calibre people in our defence forces. They are right through the ranks and in every role that is performed so well.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also good to have members of the Defence Force come and see us in operation here in our parliament. I am very happy that the program has been so successful this year. I think it is a very important program to continue. I believe it was started because it was felt that members of parliament did not have the same contact with the defence forces that occurred when we were closer to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         when many members of parliament were actually serving Defence Force members. Although I think many of us have some connection with the Defence Force—relatives or close friends who are part of the defence forces—there is probably no substitute for being a member of the Defence Force. At least we did have the opportunity for a short time to be alongside them as they worked to see how they operate. I congratulate everyone involved in the program and I can assure you that my medal of participation sits proudly in my office.
