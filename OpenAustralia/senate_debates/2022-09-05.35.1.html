        If you are a parent and a stranger approaches your child to tell them about safe sex, transgenderism, abortion and pornography, you'd probably call the police, or at least you'd intervene to protect your children. Yet, staggeringly, such people regularly visit our children's schools to give lectures on sexuality. In truth, these seminars are another injection of adult content into an already politicised school system, a school system which is tanking in the areas of maths and reading on a world scale. But the neo-Marxists in our school systems are determined to teach their radical gender theory and their extreme climate alarmism and to destigmatise every single sexual behaviour, imposing their world view onto our children and they don't want you to know about it. I am aware of at least one program of this kind in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        school system covertly doing the rounds at the moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education departments assume that these so-called experts know what is best for our children, while most parents simply want their kids to learn how to read and write. The nuclear family is under attack from the school curriculum and the ideologues who are in command of it. Few people know that sex education was invented by the Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs who, in the early 1990s, as deputy commissar for education, sought to break down family bonds by introducing radical and compulsory sex education into schools. This agenda is still being sold to parents today as helping kids make responsible choices but the point is simply to normalise and destigmatise adult concepts. Children deserve to be protected from a constant stream of adult concepts and parents deserve the right to raise their children with their own values.

        Do you know what your child is learning at school? If you don't, I suggest you take a closer look at their curriculum and then take an even closer look at some of the programs being brought into their classrooms. I suspect you may not like what you find.
