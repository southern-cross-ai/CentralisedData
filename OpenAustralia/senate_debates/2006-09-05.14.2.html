        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs. Will the minister please update the Senate on the Howard government’s efforts to combat the abhorrent crime of people trafficking?

         I thank Senator Parry for what is a very important question. This is a very topical issue and it has been covered by the press in recent times. I think it is important to look at the good work that is being done in relation to the fight against people trafficking not only in our region but in Australia. Unfortunately, Australia remains a destination country. Whilst debate goes on as to the number of victims, the government’s firm position is that one victim of people trafficking is just one victim too many.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can advise the Senate that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         has undertaken over 112 investigations and assessments of allegations of trafficking related offences since 2004. Twenty-two people have been charged and there have been four convictions to date. Those convictions have involved sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment. It was in August last year that this parliament passed laws in relation to the trafficking in children. The increased range of offences was a result of experiences learnt in the investigation of what is a really vile trade.
        </p>
        <p>
         As well as federal law enforcement and the very good work being done the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Federal Police
         </a>
         and its strike team, which deals with not only people trafficking but also sex tourism in the region, we also have the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
         </a>
         and, of course, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         involved in this. My colleague Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, has overseen the introduction of new visa arrangements which involve both witness protection and a bridging F visa. That is coupled with the criminal justice stay visa, which allows us to have victims stay in Australia and, at the same time, receive support whilst they are here to assist authorities in relation to their investigations, particularly in relation to prosecutions. It is very important that we have victims available to give evidence. Of course, to do that we need the necessary visa requirements met and the backup for those people. We provide backup with intensive support and assistance in the form of income support, secure accommodation, access to medical services and other training involving the English language—and that, of course, is essential.
        </p>
        <p>
         AusAID has also been involved in projects in the region. In 2003, we announced a $12 million program, Asia Regional Cooperation to Prevent People Trafficking, and that involved work in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Burma, and indirectly in Indonesia, China and Vietnam. That was recently replaced by a five-year $21 million project, the Asia Regional Trafficking in Persons Project, which will build on the achievements of the previous project and facilitate a more effective co-ordinated approach in the region. It is very important that, once the victims of this trade have given evidence and assisted law enforcement in bringing those who are guilty to justice, we reintegrate them into their home countries and also that we work with countries in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         With the presence of the Vietnamese delegation in the Senate today, I want to acknowledge the cooperation that we get from law enforcement in Vietnam, and generally in the region, in the fight against what is an appalling trade—the trafficking of people for sexual servitude and the targeting of children for what is a vile trade. This effort is coupled with the work we do in fighting child sex tourism. It is very important work being done by Australian authorities and they are to be applauded.
