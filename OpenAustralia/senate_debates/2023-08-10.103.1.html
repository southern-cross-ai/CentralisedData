        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Public trust in our democracy is at an all-time low, and the community feel less and less confident that their representatives represent them—as opposed to political donors. The big four consultancy firms donated more than $4.3 million to both sides of politics over the last 10 years, and they secured $8 billion in government contracts over that same time period—work that could and should be done by a strong, independent Public Service. Polling this week has found an overwhelming national support, including from 70 per cent of Labor voters, for a ban on political donations from any organisation that receives funding from government contracts. When will the government listen to the majority of its voters and ban donations from organisations seeking or holding government contracts?

         Again, I'm happy to take the question, and I'm very pleased you like asking me questions, but this is obviously within Senator Farrell's portfolio, as the

         </a>
         . I will do my best to respond to you, Senator Waters. You are correct: I think people have been appalled by some of the reports that we have had about the behaviour of some of those firms. Senators, including Senator O'Neill and others, have rightly made comment about that. In relation to your comment about the Public Service, I think Senator Gallagher as Minister for Finance and Minister for the Public Service is working very hard to strengthen the Public Service, because we do share the view about the importance of a capable and independent public service. In relation to the political donation point, I understand JSCEM, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, provided an interim report. It has recommended introducing real-time disclosure of political donations and lowering the disclosure threshold. I understand that this report is something that Senator Farrell will be and is discussing with all parties represented in this place. I hope that we can see appropriate reforms arising out of the JSCEM report that are capable of being supported by parties across this chamber, because I agree with you—donations do go to both the perceived and actual integrity of democracy and of voting. We saw, particularly in the last election, some very large donations from some individuals had effect.

           Gas corporation Tamboran Resources who want to open up the Beetaloo basin, which will be a climate bomb, donated $200,000 to both big parties in 2021-22. In that same financial year, Tamboran received a grant of $7½ million of public money for natural gas exploration at the Beetaloo.

           attempted to disallow that, but both big parties backed it in. When will the government end the perception of being for sale by banning political donations from organisations seeking government grants?

            (—) (): Again, I would urge Senator Waters to recall that there are decisions that parties of government make—I can't speak for the coalition, but I can speak for the Labor Party—on the basis of our assessment of the right policy outcome and the right outcome for the country. I appreciate Senator Waters may not agree with some of those decisions. That's why she leads the Greens in this chamber and why I lead the Labor Party in this chamber. We have different views about the way forward for the country. Not every decision that you disagree with that we make, even if you vehemently disagree with it, is because we've had a donation. I think the implication—in fact, sometimes the accusation—from the Greens that suggests that is wrong. I do agree that a more transparent and accountable system of donations is a good thing.

              Donations to political parties shouldn't be able to buy government contracts or grants, nor should they be able to buy environmental approvals. Adani and its subsidiaries donated $250,000 to the coalition in the same year as it received its final environmental approvals for its megamine. When will the government ban political donations from corporations seeking environmental approval?

               Again I'd refer to my previous answer, and I would make the point—although far be it from me to defend decisions the coalition made—that there is the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
                EPBC
               </a>
               Act, which provides the minister of the day with statutory obligations and discretion. That is the context in which decisions are made, but the senator correctly identifies it is important that the principle of transparency and accountability across our electoral system, particularly in relation to donations, is optimised. I have no doubt that Senator Farrell, who is a very consultative minister in relation to this issue, understands the importance of negotiating and discussing this matter with parties. I hope that we can see cross-party agreement around reforms as we go forward.
