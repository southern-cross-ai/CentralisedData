        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and the Minister for Homelessness, Senator Farrell. I keep hearing from constituents and stakeholders across Tasmania about the urgent need for more affordable housing. Knowing that the Labor government has a clear and ambitious housing reform agenda that will deliver housing for Australians who are in urgent need of safe and affordable places to live, how does the Albanese government's housing reform agenda demonstrate a shift from the inaction we have seen on housing over the previous decade?

         I thank Senator Bilyk for her great interest in this area that's so important to her home state of Tasmania. Sadly, under the former Liberal and National government there was nearly a decade of inaction on housing policy—a lack of action that left too many Australians struggling to put a roof over their heads. That's why Australians are welcoming a new approach to housing policy, an approach which has seen the Albanese government hit the ground running, delivering an ambitious housing reform agenda. The shift in approach in housing policy is stark. Those opposite didn't hold a single meeting about housing with the states in their entire last term.

          Yes, shame. The current Minister for Housing is showing national leadership through regular housing ministerial council meetings. They have met multiple times this year. The former government also showed no interest in social and affordable housing. In contrast, the Housing Australia Future Fund will see the Albanese government deliver 30,000 new social and affordable homes in the fund's first five years, including a minimum of 1,200 in the senator's home state of Tasmania. The former government had no plan for housing and failed to deliver housing for Australians in need. The Albanese government has a comprehensive housing agenda that is delivering social and affordable housing for Australians. It's an agenda that's delivering for all Australians, particularly Tasmanians in your home state, Senator Bilyk.

            Thanks for that, Minister. I, like all my colleagues on this side, am very pleased to hear that the Albanese government are delivering homes for Australians who need them. I'm particularly interested in the announcement yesterday about further progress on the delivery of the Albanese government's Housing Australia Future Fund. Given this update, can you, Minister, outline what obstacles remain to the establishment of the fund?

             I thank Senator Bilyk for her first supplementary question. Yes, I can answer that question. The Housing Australia Future Fund will be life changing, an ongoing pipeline of funding for new social and affordable rental homes, not just for now but for generations to come. It's urgently needed, and we look forward to its passage. It's needed because far too many Australians are being hit by growing rents or struggling to buy a home, and far too many Australians are facing or experiencing homelessness.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are in this situation because of a decade of inaction from those opposite, and again the Liberals and the Nationals are opposing real action through the Housing Australia Future Fund. Saying no and doing nothing for Australians who need safe and affordable homes—that's what we've come to expect from them. But Australians know that they can expect more from the Albanese Labor government.

               Minister, I've seen the media feedback from stakeholders warmly welcoming the progress of the Housing Australia Future Fund and the government's housing agenda, including strong support from the building and construction sector. Can you provide an update to the Senate on how the government's housing reform agenda will work with vital sectors for the delivery of these new homes?

                Yes, I can, Senator Bilyk, and thank you for that question. The Albanese government wants every Australian to have a roof over their head. That's why we're working with sectors who are at the front line of delivering the homes our country needs. We've heard from the community sector about the difference the Housing Australia Future Fund will make. We are working with the construction industry to ensure our policies are considered and targeted in addressing the real issues confronting the housing system. Our policies are delivering in collaboration with community housing providers, construction companies and local councils. We look forward to the passage of the Housing Australia Future Fund as part of our broad reform agenda and to continuing to work hard to ensure more Australians have access to safe and affordable homes.
