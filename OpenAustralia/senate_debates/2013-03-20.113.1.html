        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister outline to the Senate the importance of investment in rural research and development? Further, what is the government doing to support rural research and development and are there alternative positions?

            The Gillard government is a strong supporter of rural research and development investment. Our government has a plan for Australian agriculture, unlike those opposite. Our plan is to build on the strong foundation for farmers through our new opportunities in the Asian century and to prepare for the future. The key to that is research and development. In five budgets to date, the Gillard government has provided research and development corporations with approximately $1.1 billion and this government is a proud defender of the work that is done in research and development.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, when the

             Productivity Commission
            </a>
            tried to halve the research and development funding, this government rejected that. However, I cannot say the same for the coalition government, the Liberals and National parties on the other side.

             The Liberals

            and Nationals are using tactics of there being a small target before the election and using groups like the IPA to develop their hit list—that is what you are doing—so you can implement the cuts should you get into government.
           </p>
           <p>
            In response to this, the member for Calare, Mr Cobb, refused to release their policy plan for agriculture. You do not have a plan for agriculture. You have not articulated what your plan for agriculture will be. Mr Cobb said that it would be released in good time. That is hardly reassuring for farmers. The Gillard government remains committed to a strong agricultural—

                   Senator Ludwig, you are lucky; sit down. When these excited people on my left are quiet, for those who want to debate it, the time is after question time. You have 17 minutes to go.

                   Thank you, Senator Ronaldson. I do not need those forms of interjection, either. Order on both sides! In 17 minutes time you will have the opportunity to debate the answers to questions during question time, not now.

                           Of course, this list is really a hit list against regional Australia. If you look at the way it is going to be followed they can find some comfort from this, particularly from Premier Campbell Newman in Queensland, because their plan was very similar. They first said nothing. In fact, we all remember Premier Campbell Newman saying that the Public Service had nothing to fear.
