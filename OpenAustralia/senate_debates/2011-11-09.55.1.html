        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Can the minister respond to claims that the steel industry has been mugged, vandalised, shot and crippled by the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan?

           What we have heard is wild and overblown rhetoric by Liberal senators on these questions. What we saw yesterday and today was that 19 Liberal senators had the opportunity to argue the case in favour of blue-collar workers, in favour of steelworkers—and what did they do? They turned their backs on blue-collar workers; they turned their backs on the steel industry. They had 19 opportunities, but what we saw was the fraudulence and hypocrisy of the position advanced by the Liberal Party, to the point where the Liberal Party has turned its back on a $300 million support package for high-quality sustainable jobs in the steel industry.

             . What we have seen is the Liberal Party trying, in a very cynical manner, to run a very populist line on economic policy. We know that they are a party of nostalgia, a party that looks back to the old days. However, I would never, ever have thought they would adopt the policies of

                 I am looking forward to the Liberal Party going down to the Illawarra and telling steelworkers that $300 million for the steel industry is of no assistance. I am looking forward to them trying to pretend, as Mr Abbott does on a regular basis, that they know how to use a screwdriver, yet cannot do anything to actually help workers in the manufacturing industry. They say they are going to repeal these measures. I am looking forward to them saying how they are going to withdraw over $20 billion of assistance from industries across this country.

                          We have heard those opposite claim there is nothing further that can be done with regard to science and innovation in the steel industry. It is a classic case where ignorance cannot be enlightened. We know, for instance, that

CSIRO's integrated steelmaking process is one of the few known technologies which can deliver a substantial cut in carbon emissions at minimum cost to smelters. This is a proposition we are now likely to see put into commercial operation in a very short period of time.

                          The estimated value of this knowledge over the next 20 years is some $42 billion. That is assuming just a 10 per cent market penetration. This is not just some incredible dream. These are practical measures that science can deliver to industry. And industry working in collaboration with our scientists is able to advance and produce the high-skilled—
