          I will be moving a second amendment to omit the following bills: Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 1) Bill 2017; Superannuation Laws Amendment (Strengthening Trustee Arrangements) Bill 2017; and Treasury Laws Amendment (Improving Accountability and Member Outcomes in Superannuation Measures No. 2) Bill 2017.
         </p>
         <p>
          Just for the chamber's clarification, Senator Brandis has moved a motion which obviously goes to what government business will be considered and some hours at the conclusion of that. Senator Patrick has moved the amendment I had previously foreshadowed, which was to bring on the penalty rates protection bill first. I indicate that, given we foreshadowed it, the Labor Party will be supporting Senator Patrick's amendment. In addition, Labor does not wish to proceed with the superannuation legislation that the government has put into the program, and we will oppose that. We are also seeking to move that the superannuation bills not be included in the bills which must be dealt with before the Senate rises. I trust that assists the Senate.
