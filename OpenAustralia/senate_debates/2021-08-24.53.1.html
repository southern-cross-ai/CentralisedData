        I rise this afternoon in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Senate
        </a>
        to take a moment to acknowledge an exemplary community leader. Her name is Mrs Joan Hillman. She has recently concluded her four-year term as the president of the Jewish Community Council of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Joan has led her community with distinction, and this afternoon I'm proud to recognise some of the highlights of her time as president.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joan has personally committed countless hours organising and communicating across the Jewish community in Western Australia, as well as working closely with others to address concerns such as anti-Semitic violence and to provide a strong community led response to some of the many challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic in Western Australia. Under Joan's leadership, the Jewish Community Council has facilitated various forms of community dialogue, such as an interfaith panel on countering racism and gender discrimination; collaboration with other groups, like the Hellenic Community of WA; and creating a wonderful and very powerful mosaic of community group cooperation across Western Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, I was honoured to join Joan last year to represent the Jewish community in laying wreaths at the Jewish War Memorial in Perth ahead of Anzac Day, as well as joining many others in commemorating the victims of the Holocaust at a virtual service during the pandemic. Of course, I'm delighted to join with my other Western Australian Senate colleagues in acknowledging the coalition government's $6 million contribution to the redevelopment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Community_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Jewish Community Centre
        </a>
        in Western Australia and the construction of an important Holocaust museum. On behalf of everyone in this parliament, I applaud the wonderful leadership that Joan Hillman has provided not just to the Western Australian Jewish community but also to many community groups across Western Australia. Congratulations to you, Joan.
