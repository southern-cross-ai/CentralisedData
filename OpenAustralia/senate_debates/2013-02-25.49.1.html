          The government believe in an Australia that makes things and we believe that Australian manufacturing workers are entitled to jobs that are both highly paid and highly skilled. That is why last week the Prime Minister announced that the government is investing $1 billion in a plan to support Australian businesses and to grow jobs. Our plan sets out a road map for creating these jobs, lifting productivity and boosting innovation. Whilst the opposition does not like to hear this—

            It is a positive plan that backs Australian firms to win more work on infrastructure and resource projects and it is a positive plan that supports innovation by establishing up to 10 precincts, bringing industry leaders, firms and research organisations together. It is a positive plan that will help small to medium sized businesses grow and create new opportunities and new local jobs. The first two precincts, in Melbourne and Adelaide, have already been announced and soon the government will introduce its Australian Jobs Bill into the parliament.

           <p>
            Compared to the negativity of those opposite, the difference is quite stark. All the coalition has delivered is relentless negativity, which is now being supported, unfortunately, by the Greens, and the Liberal and National parties are threatening the government’s jobs plans for their own cynical political purposes.
           </p>
           <p>
            We believe, of course, that Australian workers deserve more, and that is why this Labor government is delivering for Australian workers: because Labor is the only party with a sincere commitment to jobs. It is why our $1 billion plan is focused on not only—

                        Thank you. As I was saying, only two days later Senator Milne said the Greens would vote against reforms to a tax incentive that will largely affect big mining and resources companies. And why? Because they want to increase a tax on big mining and resource companies. So the Greens profess to oppose the mining industry, yet they say they will vote for measures such as a tax concession to research coal seam gas extraction and improve drilling techniques. Adding to their appalling approach to our plan, we have an opposition consistent in its relentless negativity to workers' jobs in this country. To Labor, nothing is more important than workers' jobs.
