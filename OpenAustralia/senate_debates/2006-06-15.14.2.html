         Do you mean motion No. 454 or No. 453? In my notes, No. 454 relates to

          West Papua
         </a>
         . I have just been advised it is a misprint. You are correct; my notes are wrong.

           Yes, I will clarify that. As we have just heard from the Clerk, motion No. 453 , which relates to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua" rel="nofollow">

            by leave—I would like to make a short statement before agreeing to take this as a formal motion. Like many senators in this place today and in the past, I am of the view that there is a range of business that should not be dealt with as formal business. Many complex propositions are put forward in this place and deserve to be debated. It is an abuse of the formal business process to put these complex propositions to a simple yes/no decision, without the opportunity to really debate them. Formal business is intended for simple process matters or matters where there is no need for debate.

             Mr President

            , could you ask the

             Procedure Committee
            </a>
            to again have a look at this matter. On a number of motions today that are not really substantive or where there is not really an opportunity to debate them, I will be abstaining.

             There is no objection to the motion being taken as formal, but I have noted what you have said. Of course, you can always deny formality,

              by leave—One of the regular things that we do in the Senate is acknowledge particular days of national significance. This motion is about one of those days: World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. It is an issue we have spoken about in this chamber. I had the opportunity to speak with the office of the minister, who I understand is in agreement with recognising and acknowledging this day. One of the practices of this chamber is that when people want to discuss a particular motion that is being put forward the opportunity is there for them to do that, by giving notice the day before. That is the opportunity that the minister’s office took up, to speak with me last night about this motion, and we were able to reach agreement and be happy to proceed with this motion. That is an opportunity that is open to all senators who seek to engage in the debate, and I encourage all senators, including
