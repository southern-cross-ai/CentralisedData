        My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Senator Scullion. Will the minister inform the Senate of Australian government programs and initiatives which are assisting Australians to buy or rent their home? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank the senator for her question and recognise her longstanding interest in housing afffordability not only in the Illawarra but also in the wider
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

         constituency. The greatest assistance in housing affordability that this government could ever give to Australians is by providing a fantastic and sustainable economy. As all in this place should know—although I understand there are some on the other side who are in denial—this government has delivered just that. Unemployment is now at 4.5 per cent, a 32-year low. People who are considering buying their own homes should also consider the 10.9 per cent unemployment that was left for this government to deal with. There are over two million new jobs and wages have increased by 19.8 per cent. We have a strong and stable economy which enables more people to be in a position to buy their own home.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement this government has delivered $4.75 billion and provides an additional $2.2 billion in rental assistance to assist social security recipients and families on low incomes. The family tax benefit part A, increasing the income tax threshold, as well as the extension to supplements to families with three children are fantastic initiatives which have assisted people at the coalface. And of course there is the major income tax change which means that 80 per cent of Australians now pay less than 30c in the dollar—an absolutely significant incentive that will allow people to save money to buy their own homes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Interestingly, despite this fantastic economy, there is no doubt—and all of us who are interested in this area would recognise—that people are having some trouble affording their own homes. It is interesting that the senator alluded to alternative tax policies, because I think that has a great deal to do with people’s capacity to buy their own home. The state and territory governments collect significant amounts in stamp duty and in various other land taxes. Much more could be done in this area in order to improve housing affordability.

            New South Wales

           government, uses property as a vehicle to raise tax.’ He went on to say—and this is a number which I think they should be concerned with—that families buying a new home in Sydney pay on average $68,000 in infrastructure charges with every new home. This is the new housing affordability tax by the Iemma government. I would not be being so smart about it on the other side.
          </p>
          <p>
           We do our best. We provide the first home loans grant. Do you know where that goes? In New South Wales it goes straight into the coffers of the Labor Party. State governments continue to have a love affair with money rather than caring about their constituents.

             of 21 March said that we can expect this housing affordability tax to go to $15 billion this year. Another $1.7 billion from the

             in New South Wales is returned to New South Wales, but do we see any relief for New South Wales people buying houses? Absolutely not. It goes straight into the Iemma skyrocket. That is what is going to continue. Based on the performance of the Iemma government, New South Wales people can make a very good decision on Saturday and vote them completely out of office. That is the only way houses are going to be affordable in New South Wales.

                   , I rise on a point of order. I think you were correct in ruling that the chamber had become noisy, but I would appreciate it if you would also bring that to the attention of ministers who shout for four minutes in allegedly answering a question which was designed to be an attack in the lead-up to the state election and which failed miserably. I urge you to consider both sides of the chamber when making such rulings.

But I do take the point that there is a lot of noise in the chamber. I would remind all senators, including ministers, that shouting is disorderly. Senator Nettle, do you have a point of order?

                        , I would ask you to review your decision to allow that supplementary question. In the past, you have ruled that people can ask questions about alternative policies or other parties, but that supplementary question named a particular party and asked about it. I want you to review that, because in the past you have made different rulings that did not allow that kind of question. I would ask you to review your decision to allow that question.
