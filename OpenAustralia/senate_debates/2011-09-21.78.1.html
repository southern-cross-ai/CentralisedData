        last Thursday which showed that the unemployment rate in regional Australia is six per cent while the unemployment rate in capital cities is 5.1 per cent. Given that the economic modelling confirms that a carbon tax will hit regional Australia the hardest, can the minister provide the name of one person with a green job in regional Australia?

         First, in relation to unemployment, I assume that the senator would acknowledge the relatively low unemployment we have in Australia. I would hope he would acknowledge that it is in great part due to the actions taken by this government, opposed by those opposite, to stave off a recession—action which was opposed by those opposite and which ensured that some 200,000 Australians who would have been on the dole queues are not but are in work. This government have created 730,000 jobs since we came to government, the effect of which can be seen by looking at where the American unemployment rate is and where ours is. We entered the global financial crisis with around the same rate of unemployment; we have exited this period with an unemployment rate with a five in front of it, as opposed to a nine. In relation to the impact, essentially I think the question comes down to the impact on jobs in—

           , on the point of order: again, all we see from the opposition is an opportunity to restate the question. The minister is answering the question and she is being directly relevant to the question, but again we see the second tier, where they simply suggest what the answer is in the question. The minister is answering the question.

                       , in fairness you must allow Senator Joyce to finish his question. He was interrupted by interjections from the other side which, on this occasion, you did not pull into line. I could not even hear Senator Joyce, and I am sitting very close to him. I ask that you allow him to finish his question.

                         , 150 jobs during construction, and the solar farm in New South Wales that will create another 50 jobs. I would also make the point that the Carbon Farming Initiative, which, as I recall, was opposed by those opposite, does include a substantial investment in regional Australia, including $33.6 million to establish regional Landcare facilitated positions in each of the NRM regions which, I am advised by my colleague, is in the process of being implemented. I would make this point: Senator Joyce fails to understand the importance of moving this economy to clean energy—

Can the minister explain how the government can determine the impact of the carbon tax on regional Australia, when it has released no modelling of the impact of the carbon tax on regional Australia? When will the government come clean with regional Australia and release the detailed modelling of the impact of the carbon tax on towns such as Rockhampton, held by

It was done by the Australian Treasury, the people who used to advise Mr Costello. That is the modelling the government has released.

                              If the senator wants to look at the commitment of this government to regional Australia I would invite him to consider the budget that was handed down earlier this year. We consolidated the programs of expenditure in regional Australia into a single document—a budget book. It shows that this government is delivering more for regional Australia than Senator Joyce was ever able to gain from a coalition government: more in health, more in education and more in infrastructure.
