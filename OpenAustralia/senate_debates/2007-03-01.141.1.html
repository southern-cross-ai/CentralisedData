        I want to briefly take note of the Fisheries Research and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_Corporation" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        report for 2005-06. In doing so, I pay particular tribute to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Director
        </a>
        of the FRDC, Dr Patrick Hone, who brings a wealth of experience and very extensive knowledge to the FRDC. He has been closely involved in all sectors of the fishing industry, and over the past decade he has played a key role in the planning, management and funding of fisheries related research and development in Australia. He has a PhD in the development of aquaculture feed for abalone and has been involved in the development of several significant aquaculture industry developments, including southern bluefin tuna, Pacific oyster, abalone and mussel aquaculture.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as paying tribute to the work that Dr Hone and his staff do, I also recognise the board of that organisation, who—without going through them individually—between them provide a vast expanse of experience in the fishing industry and in science and research. That organisation over many years has been very significant in the development of Australia’s fisheries industry. It is an organisation which, through funds which are provided more or less equally by the government and industry, has been at the forefront of innovative programs to help the fishing industry and to help those who help the fishing industry in many forms.
       </p>
       <p>
        The FRDC has an enviable record of progress and contribution towards the industry. I know that the FRDC has been over many years very closely involved in research on the southern bluefin tuna. Many in this chamber called for the southern bluefin tuna to be absolutely protected. I do not think that is necessary, and the scientists and researchers who follow these things more technically than I do agree with that proposition. The southern bluefin tuna supports a very significant part of the Australian industry, one that has very substantial exports to Japan. The city of

        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        is built upon the success of the southern bluefin tuna industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        That industry has embarked upon, although with some division amongst those involved, research and commercial activities to try to close the life cycle of the southern bluefin tuna. A company, Clean Seas Tuna, in which I should indicate I have a very small number of shares, is operated principally by the Stehr family in Port Lincoln. That company is trying to breed southern bluefin tuna in captivity. If this were to occur, it would be a revolutionary event which would change the face of fishing for that species in the world. Southern bluefin tuna is one of Australia’s biggest seafood exports, going mainly to Japan, but there is controversy about its sustainability. Currently it breeds near Indonesia, comes around the bottom coast of Australia and goes out into the Pacific and, as it is swimming past South Australia, it is captured and taken in and then fed, fattened and sold at great profit for Australia. Were the research able to close the life cycle, that would be, as I have said, a very significant event. Part of the industry in Port Lincoln is looking at that. We need to keep an eye on that, and certainly the FRDC has been very much involved in the research undertaken into the southern bluefin tuna.
