        Before I begin my remarks on the topic I want to cover today, I'd just like to say that I really did enjoy the contributions from Senator Griff, Senator Polley and Senator Rennick. They cover a broad spectrum, but I really did enjoy the contribution each of them made. And there's one other preliminary point I want to cover before I go to the substance of my statement. I was just informed that Dr John Volep, a history teacher of mine from my old school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich Grammar School
        </a>
        , has passed away. He was an outstanding history, English and German teacher. He put his heart and soul into teaching his students. In my first speech in this place, I talked about the significance and the importance of our early educators, and I think Dr John Volep's family and friends should reflect on that legacy as they mourn his passing.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my first speech in the Senate I also said that the decisions we make here matter. They have a profound impact on people's lives. We must never forget it. The same applies with respect to decisions made by state governments and state parliaments. We have seen this in recent times with the impact of Queensland's border restrictions. At a press conference held on 18 August 2020, Premier
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annastacia_Palaszczuk" rel="nofollow">
         Annastacia Palaszczuk
        </a>
        was asked about a woman from northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        who nearly lost her baby after being denied access to health care in Queensland. Premier Palaszczuk said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People living in New South Wales, they have New South Wales hospitals. In Queensland, we have Queensland hospitals for our people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me say it again:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People living in New South Wales, they have New South Wales hospitals. In Queensland, we have Queensland hospitals for our people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those comments were met with outrage and disappointment across this country, including in my home state of Queensland, and for good reason. First, they do not reflect the reality of the situation. Thousands of Queenslanders receive treatment in hospitals outside of Queensland every year. Likewise, thousands of people from New South Wales receive treatment in Queensland hospitals. Their state of origin or place of permanent residency is irrelevant. All that matters is their need for help. Second, the Commonwealth provides billions—that's billions with a 'b'—of dollars to public hospitals every year, money provided for the benefit of all Australians. But, much more than that, those words do not reflect who we are as Queenslanders. We are better than that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those words came back to haunt Premier Palaszczuk following the tragic case of a lady from northern New South Wales who lost an unborn twin. A decision was made by her health providers in New South Wales that she should travel to Sydney for treatment instead of driving just a few hours to Queensland. Now, I'm prepared to accept that perhaps the Premier misspoke on 18 August 2020 when she said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People living in New South Wales, they have New South Wales hospitals. In Queensland, we have Queensland hospitals for our people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps the words did not come out properly. We all make mistakes, especially in the flow of a media interview. Moreover, other states are also grappling with these issues. Over the last two weeks I've heard tragic examples from colleagues in other states. But, when faced with the most recent tragedy, the Premier didn't demonstrate any contrition. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk doubled down. For me, as a senator representing Queensland, that was truly the low point in this debate about border restrictions. There was no contrition from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. There was no awareness—

         Senator Scarr, can I just remind you of standing order 193(3) about personal reflections, including on members of other parliaments. Your comments have not yet reached that but are coming close. You have the call.

         <p>
          If you could excuse my passion for this subject, Queenslanders are truly outraged at the comments of our Premier
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annastacia_Palaszczuk" rel="nofollow">
           Annastacia Palaszczuk
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          There appeared to be no awareness of how cruel the original comments appeared, especially in the context of the most recent tragedy. As reported by the ABC, when reporters asked Premier Palaszczuk whether she regretted her earlier choice of words—and I'm going to give the full quotation so it cannot be alleged that I've taken these words out of context, so the full quotation will be on the record of this place—Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          No, because these are really difficult decisions and … people deserve the best health care, and … if they can get the health care locally, then that is good. If it is an emergency or if we have the expertise, of course we will do that.
         </p>
         <p>
          As I said, I have provided the full context of the Premier's response. I'm not selectively quoting from Premier Palaszczuk, because I want her own words to be judged in their entirety. Premier Palaszczuk's words and related commentary from the Queensland health minister Dr Steven Miles did not reflect the reality of the situation. In the face of tragedy, when the appalling result of the Queensland Labor government's mismanagement of this issue was laid bare for all to see, the Queensland Labor government reverted to what it does best: blame shifting and spin. It must have been the fault of someone else. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          health authorities had got it all wrong. Of course Queensland would have helped.
         </p>
         <p>
          To that, I have three responses. First, if emergency assistance was available in this situation without a bureaucratic process, why was that not clearly spelt out in the Queensland government's own health directive? I have it here: Border restrictions Direction (No. 12). There is no reference to emergency health care. In fact, paragraph 35, the provisions relating to health care, speaks of the need to schedule appointments. Since the date of its publication, the Queensland government has had to set up a new unit and a new hotline to deal with these issues.
         </p>
         <p>
          Second, if there was some informal understanding outside of the health directive or if it went without saying that help would be provided by Queensland, why were the health authorities in northern New South Wales unaware of it? Surely, in the height of a pandemic, this is a key piece of information? Was there no communication, or did the health authorities in New South Wales simply act in accordance with what was the true situation?
         </p>
         <p>
          Third, above all else, what message did the Queensland Labor Premier think her rhetoric would convey? Words matter. Cruel words lacking empathy matter even more, and Premier Palaszczuk's words sent a message that the people of New South Wales should seek assistance from their own hospitals. When given the chance to demonstrate contrition—any contrition to clarify and to soften the message—Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said no. As the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Ms Deb Frecklington, said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This is absolutely tragic.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          My heart bleeds for the family and everything they have been put through.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          When it comes to medical emergencies and border exemptions, the Premier needs to be more compassionate and consistent—not have one rule for the rich and another rule for everyday Australians.
         </p>
         <p>
          That reflects the views of millions of my fellow Queenslanders. That statement by the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Ms Deb Frecklington, is a true articulation of our Queensland values.
