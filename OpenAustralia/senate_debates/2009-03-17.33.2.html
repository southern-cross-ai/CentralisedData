        and Water, Senator Wong. I refer to the 2,700 jobs already lost in the Queensland coal industry. Has the minister done any modelling or received any further advice on how many more jobs will be lost when a carbon emission charge of $2.4 billion is placed on the Queensland coal industry?

         I thank Senator Boswell for his question. One of the issues that Senator Boswell obviously never seems to turn his mind to is the number of jobs that will be lost if we fail to act on climate change. It is interesting to note the number of people employed in agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin. I was of the understanding that the National Party were the defenders of agriculture. I remind the good senator of the Garnaut projections about the effect on agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin if emissions are not reduced and if climate change—

             The agricultural sector in the basin employs about 90,000 people. I would hope that, as a good senator from Queensland, Senator Boswell would have some regard to the many thousands of people—60,000 people, based on one Queensland government publication—who are supported by tourism and the industries associated with the

              Great Barrier Reef
             </a>
             . These are the sorts of issues that Senator Boswell, who is a well-known climate change sceptic, does not wish to address. I note the interjection previously from Senator McGauran, which confirms yet again that the sceptics are on the ascendancy on the other side. We have designed the

                As I was saying, we have designed this scheme so as to support jobs in industries today whilst investing in the jobs of the future. The good senator should consider the white paper, which provides some three-quarters of a billion dollars of assistance to the coalmining industry—that is, $750 million which was specifically put in place to recognise some of the transitional assistance that that industry and other industries need.

                  I again say that the coal industry, the coalminers, were provided under the government’s white paper with some three-quarters of a billion dollars worth of assistance. The senator asked in his earlier question about modelling. I would invite him to consider the Treasury modelling, the largest modelling exercise in the nation’s history, which talks about the fact, amongst other things, that the value of output in coalmining, gas extraction, metal products et cetera will increase by 2050 even with the introduction of the scheme—and I would emphasise that was assuming a less generous set of assistance to industry than the government in fact implemented. In other words, the modelling demonstrates that these sectors can continue to grow. However, this government, because it is responsible and it is serious about supporting jobs today as well as the jobs of tomorrow, provided more assistance than was set out in the green paper.

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. Minister, you did not model the white paper. How can the Queensland coal industry be competitive against China, Indonesia, Colombia and other countries when no other country in the world places a tax on fugitive emissions? Won’t Queensland miners be noncompetitive with a charge of $2.4 billion and be forced to shed more jobs?

                    Well, really, the question the Australian people will ask is: how can we take the opposition seriously on climate change? The position Senator Boswell has just articulated is a more hardline position than they executed Mr Nelson for. It is the position that you did not like your then leader, Mr Nelson, putting out as your public position. But what you are retaining now, it appears from Senator Boswell’s question, is a position that says, ‘We don’t want to act.’ We know that you are the do-nothing party when it comes to jobs; we saw that on the $42 billion stimulus package—do nothing; sit on your hands. It is the same when it comes to climate change.

                     , I rise on a point of order. My point of order is relevance. I asked a question about a $2.4 billion carbon charge on the Queensland mining industry. The minister has not addressed it once. If the minister will not play the game, you are in this house as the umpire and you should make her play the game, because you are not the senator for the Labor Party, you are the senator for the chamber. We have all voted for you, including me. Now pull her into order, please.

                      , can I say that that was a disgraceful interjection by Senator Boswell in taking a point of order. If you are going to raise a point of order then, with all respect, stay relevant to the point of order when you raise it. In this instance the minister has been relevant to the question, has been answering in relation to—

                          As I was saying, apparently what Senator Boswell is putting is that we should not take action on climate change in this nation at all unless the rest of the world acts first. That is the same position that

                          held. It is a harder line than Mr Nelson held before he was moved on, shall we say, by those on the other side. We are serious about not only supporting today’s jobs but supporting the jobs of tomorrow.
