             That was before I worked for the Carr government—that is true. But enough of my biography,

              Mr President
             </a>
             ; it is not that interesting. I also want to acknowledge that this is, I think, the second question this year from the good senator on industrial relations. It is clearly an issue he wants to talk so much about! Who could have forgotten his stellar performance in the last federal election campaign, where he came out and made clear that the opposition would actually go back to

             in the first few days and then was sin-binned for the rest of the election? I discern in the question that this relates to the Grocon dispute.

               I think this relates to the Grocon dispute. I am not quite sure if that is the case, from all the rhetoric in the question, but I think that is right. I am going to be clear, as Mr Shorten has been, that the government has condemned any violence or intimidation anywhere and at Grocon sites and has called for all parties to obey orders of the police and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">

               . The government is, as Mr Shorten has made clear, pleased there was a return to work. We note that Supreme Court proceedings initiated by Grocon are ongoing and we await judgement. I am advised it is not appropriate at this stage to comment on those proceedings. I am also advised that civil proceedings commenced in the

                   I will get some more advice for the senator if I can. I understand that the question is whether or not amendments to the Fair Work (Building Industry) legislation could stop the FWBC from prosecuting the

                   </a>
                   . The advice I have is no. The government amendments to the Fair Work (Building Industry) legislation were designed to ensure FWBC resources were not spent on matters where there was litigation on foot and that litigation had been discontinued by the parties. I am advised that Grocon had not commenced any proceedings within the jurisdiction of the FWBC.

                     That is just petty. I have been in this chamber long enough, including on the Work Choices debate, which Senator Abetz was so proud to lead on behalf of the Howard government. Oh, I remember the hours in here!

                     I am advised that Fair Work Building and Construction has extensive investigation and prosecution powers regarding breaches of industrial law, the capacity to use coercive powers and the capacity to seek imposition of significant penalties and the recovery of economic loss. In that context, I do not agree with the proposition in the question that Senator Abetz put to me about the abolition of the
