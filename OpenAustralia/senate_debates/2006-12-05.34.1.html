        Pursuant to standing order 74(5) I ask Minister Ellison, the Minister representing the Attorney-General, for an explanation as to why an answer has not been provided to my question on notice No. 2505 asked on 25 September relating to fire safe cigarettes.

         I understand there was an answer given to that question. If that has not been received yet by Senator Allison, I can advise the Senate that that was a question that was asked on 25 September 2006 with five parts relating to cigarettes, the cause of fires by cigarettes and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIP" rel="nofollow">
          RIP

         cigarettes. Without detaining the Senate I can table that question and provide a copy to Senator Allison, if that is satisfactory. Or I can read it into the record if it is so wished.
