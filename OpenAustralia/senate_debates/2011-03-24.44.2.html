        Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration: There are significant (and growing) problems with Australia’s anti-dumping system. Senate Committee examination of this Bill could be complementary (or even concurrent) to the committee process already initiated for consideration of proposed changes to the wider anti-dumping regime through a related Private Senator’s Bill introduced by Senator Xenophon: Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping) Bill 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Possible submissions or evidence from: Similar for the submissions and hearings on Senator Xenophon’s Bill, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Representatives of companies in industries that are significantly impacted by anti-dumping legislation - such as the steel fabrication, paper, timber, food processing, cement/ concrete and plastics and chemicals industries.

The Bill does not detail the very performance indicators that the Authority is established to monitor and report on. Additionally several organisations believe that data set should be specified before the Authority is formed, that it is made public and that it is presented to the Parliament as regulations which can be disallowed.
