        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Watt. How many passengers have passed through Australian international airports from Indonesia since the foot-and-mouth outbreak was reported in Bali on 5 July 2022?

               Thanks, President. There was only one question asked. That was: 'How many passengers have passed through Australian international airports from Indonesia since the foot-and-mouth outbreak was reported in Bali?' Senator Watt has taken that on notice already. He is now simply moving to make political points. He has addressed the question by taking it on notice and there is nothing further to add, clearly.

                  <p>
                   Thank you, President. I think there is precedent—but obviously you will take advice from the Clerk—in the previous parliament where, even if a minister has taken on notice responding to some of the substance of what was put subsequently, he is entitled to do that. That was the practice under the previous government and the previous President.

                        When there is silence I will answer that response. The question was asked about a specific number which, you are correct, Senator Watt took on notice. But he has now been supplied with that, and in the same way that other ministers would've, he is informing the Senate of that number.

Of those, 21,948 were air travellers returning from Bali, so about 90-odd per cent. I think one of the pleasing aspects of this is that the efforts of our biosecurity officers over the weekend—it's disappointing that Senator

                                 would like the information that she has asked for, I'm happy to provide it. The week commencing 4 July this year 20,404 passengers returned to or entered Australia from Indonesia, 92.7 per cent of whom were from Bali; 23,600 the following week, the week commencing 11 July; and the most updated figures that I have are the ones that I have already given. The pleasing thing about the numbers, when you dig into them further, is that we are seeing an increased level of compliance from passengers, which shows that they are listening to the accurate, non-alarmist information that is being put out by this government, as opposed to the alarmist rhetoric coming from the opposition, which is rejected roundly by industry.

Senator McKenzie is engaging in debating points. Now, she's entitled to those points. There's an opportunity for her after this to do so. But it is not a point of order on relevance to tell the minister that, because he's given a different date, in his response to the question, to the one she's identified, that somehow is not relevant.
