           is keen to make his mark, but as the minister had not even cleared his throat, let alone had a chance to respond to the question, I think it is clearly a frivolous point of order. I ask you to rule it out of order and suggest that we allow the minister to at least have more than 10 seconds before we take a point of order.

            Order! Senator Abetz, Senator Carr is exactly 21 seconds into his answer, and we have always allowed ministers to develop an answer. There is no point of order, but I just remind Senator Carr of the question.

                    What is apparent from today’s discussion is that the opposition seems to have no regard for the real issue that concerns Australians—Australian motorists in particular, especially as we move into Easter—and that is the price of petrol. The effect that this is having on people’s disposable incomes, I think, should be understood more clearly by the opposition. What we have had is, in fact, a decade of inaction and silence on this question from the opposition. On the question of the issues—

                     I am sorry if your concern about the effects that prices of petrol are having on Australian motorists is so poor. The fact remains that the current pressure on prices is a result of a number of factors. The concern that this government has is to take action to relieve pressure on motorists and to ensure that the

                         I repeat: we have a situation here where the opposition wishes to deny the great concerns that Australians have about the price of petrol. They wish to run a different set of arguments about the question of supply. There are many arguments with regard to the issue of peak oil. There are many concerns being expressed about the factors that affect the supply of petrol. The issue that motorists are concerned about this weekend is the price of petrol. What they are very concerned about is that, with the price of petrol going from—

                              There have been many factors affecting the supply of petrol in this country. The main concern that motorists have this weekend is the price of petrol. The concern that people have is the fact that prices are rising, and it would appear to many people to be a very convenient rise indeed. Prices moving up, to over $1.50 a litre, is a matter of deep concern to people who are trying to go on holidays this weekend. I would have thought there would be greater concern expressed by the opposition on that issue. On the issue of refining and other such matters there has been an ongoing debate in this country about the capacity of the industry to respond to the international pressures that have arisen.

                                The real question, Senator Brandis, is: what is the government doing about the price of petrol? We have indicated clearly our intention and our actions with regard to the

                                 I am still at a loss as to whether Senator Carr’s answer was yes or no. My supplementary questions are: who exactly is monitoring fuel supply and pricing issues over the Easter break, given that the government’s so-called petrol commissioner has not even started work yet, and does the minister believe that anything under $1.50 a litre is a good price? What price, exactly, should motorists be paying for petrol this Easter?
