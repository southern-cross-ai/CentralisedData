        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to the words of the late
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Evans" rel="nofollow">
         Harry Evans

        , the longest-serving Clerk of the Senate:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The value of estimates hearings in improving accountability and probity of government has long been widely recognised. The hearings allow apparent problems in government operations to be explored and exposed, and give rise to a large amount of information which would not otherwise be disclosed. They have come to be recognised as a major parliamentary institution of accountability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, won't the government's plans to axe a full week from the traditional four weeks of Senate estimates lead to less accountability, lower standards of probity and reduced disclosure of information, and mean that any problems in government operations are not properly explored and exposed by the Senate?

             I will take that interjection. You're right; the parliament under you was a parliament which was not respected. The Westminster system does actually require ministers to be accountable through the parliament to the Australian people. Who was the accountable minister in that place? Mr Morrison and another! So don't come in here telling Australians you care about accountability when they saw nine years of cover-up, saw nine years of sports rorts, saw nine years where you refused the basic standards of probity—

                   Minister, Prime Minister Albanese has said again and again that the Australian people deserve transparency and accountability.

                              I remember how long they fought against an anticorruption commission. I remember how long they fought against that. And now this man, who is a member of the leadership group, has the temerity to come in here and tell us about transparency! He's discovered it now he's on that side! Everybody knows: no leadership, no backbone and a Johnny-come-lately on transparency.

                                  Thank you, President. Together with Senators Babet, Hansen, Lambie, Pocock, Roberts and Tyrrell, I have just written to Senator Wong, and the minister, indicating that we do not accept the arguments put forward by the government to defend its cutting of Senate estimates and that we will not be in a position to support the proposed sitting schedule for 2023. If, as you say, you're all for transparency, accountability and respect of the parliament, will you listen to the crossbench senators and the opposition, and revisit your decision to axe this estimates week?
