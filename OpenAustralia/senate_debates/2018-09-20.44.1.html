          Strategy 2011-2020, which was presented here last Wednesday in the parliament by the co-chairs, Associate Professor Jeremy Woolley and Dr John Crozier, with assistance from advisers Mr Lachlan McIntosh and Mr Rob MacInerney. It is absolutely unacceptable that on current figures, by the time we get to 2030, 12,000 Australians could be killed and 360,000 injured, at a cost of possibly more than $300 billion. I'm looking forward to a response from the government and Minister McCormack. Minister McCormack's response to the announcement of the report was that he was looking to work in a bipartisan relationship with Labor. We will certainly be doing everything we can to absolutely put a stop to this terrible—

             The government acknowledges the importance of the issue of improving road safety raised by the senators. It is a matter that we believe is important to all members of this parliament. The government commissioned an independent inquiry into the effectiveness of the National
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Safety" rel="nofollow">
              Road Safety
             </a>
             Strategy 2011-2020, which was released at an event attended by the government and opposition members as well as key road safety stakeholders. The government commends the work of the inquiry panel, and we will work with all stakeholders to deliver better road safety outcomes for all Australians. As the Deputy Prime Minister has said, one road death or accident is one too many.

                also are very pleased to see that this road safety strategy has been released, and we look forward to the work that needs to be done to implement the strategy so that we can have safety on our roads for all road users. In particular we note the significance of the need to be acting on road safety for the safety of cyclists, noting that cyclists comprise three per cent of all road fatalities and 15 per cent of all road hospitalisations. We look forward to the implementation of this road safety strategy so that we can reduce the number of deaths overall on our roads, particularly making cycling safer for all Australians.
