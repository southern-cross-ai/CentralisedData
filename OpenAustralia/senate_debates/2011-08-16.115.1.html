        Pursuant to standing order 74(5), I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs for an explanation as to why answers have not been provided to question Nos 232 and 274, asked nine months ago, in November 2010.

         I understand that the senator will be receiving a response to his important questions in coming days. I am also advised that the opposition will not be able to cover its $70 billion black hole from the modest amount of stationery purchased by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade.

          I move:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          That the Senate take note of the explanation.
         </p>
         <p>
          The fact is that, however the minister chooses to make light of this question, I have asked a serious question about the government's use of stationery, mobile telephones and travel and other issues that go to the competence and good administration, or lack thereof, of this government. I asked those questions of every minister in November last year, which is nine months ago. The Minister for Foreign Affairs does not seem to be able to answer those questions. I accept that that minister may have travelled somewhat more than other ministers and probably has more staff and maybe more mobile phones than other ministers, but I also note that his colleagues were able to answer those questions in a much shorter time frameâ€”for example, the Minister for Defence, with a very complex portfolio and presumably as large and complex an office, was able to answer these very questions back in January this year, seven months ago. If this government is serious about transparency and about good administration, it ought to be upfront about what it is spending on these matters. I urge the minister to provide those answers very quickly.
