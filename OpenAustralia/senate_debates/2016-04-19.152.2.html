           Labor's six-point steel plan is a thought bubble. Labor hit manufacturing with a carbon tax bill of $1.1 billion, hit the car industry with a fringe benefits tax of $1.8 billion, provided a last-minute $215 million to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM" rel="nofollow">
            GM
           </a>
           Holden and granted Alcoa $40 million in pre-closure as they forced their carbon tax on them. Under Labor, one manufacturing job was lost every 19 minutes. The Turnbull government is bringing forward large construction projects such as the Adelaide to Tarcoola rail line. To ensure a consistent and rigorous application of the Australian Industry Participation National Framework with the states and territories, the minister has placed this on the forthcoming

           agenda. The minister has also written to state and territory colleagues to secure the sustainable delivery of the Industry Capability Network services that assist projects to identify capable and competitive Australian suppliers. While Labor created an overlapping plethora of grants and entitlements, we are setting the right economic environment by reducing red tape and equipping businesses with key market information and the opportunity to expand or export competitively.

              Labor's motion reflects the Labor Party's top policy announced by the Leader of the Opposition,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
               Bill Shorten
              </a>
              , in Wollongong. The main policy points of this motion were half-heartedly welcomed by Australian steelworkers of both the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
               AMWU
              </a>
              and the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
               AWU
              </a>
              . However, it has become obvious that there is growing anger among steelworkers because both the Labor and Liberal parties refuse to support a policy to mandate the use of Australian steel for government projects. While this motion is full of comforting words and good first steps, both the AWU and the AMWU have put out press releases which essentially note that Labor has not mandated local steel in public projects. As a matter of fact, Labor's six-point plan is an absolute disgrace in terms of support for the steelworkers of Australia. This will not save jobs in this country. I am so disappointed in Bill Shorten. If this is the best you have got to secure their jobs for the future, you should be bloody ashamed of yourselves.
