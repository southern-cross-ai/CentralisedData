        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. Can the minister update the Senate on the government's support for Indigenous rangers and how this government's Indigenous Rangers Program is supporting jobs in regional and remote Australia?

         I thank Senator Bushby for the question and his longstanding interest in the outcomes for our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          First Australians
         </a>
         . We are very proud of investment in Indigenous rangers. Our Indigenous Rangers Program not only provides really good work for our First Australians but also allows them to do what they have always been doing, which is looking after both their land and sea country. I am pleased to update the Senate that now more than 2,500 of our First Australians are employed as Indigenous rangers as a consequence of our investment of now more than $500 million to 2020, and that includes the Indigenous Protected Areas Program.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have been a strong supporter of Indigenous rangers since 2007, when the coalition introduced the Indigenous Rangers Program. They have enjoyed record levels of funding since we entered government in 2013. Funding for Indigenous rangers is now at $70 million. This is a program that is committed to by all in this place. It is terrific that everyone in this place supports it. I would like to acknowledge the commitment from not only the other side but the Greens, the Nick Xenophon Team and the other members of the crossbench. Indigenous rangers are just like police and health workers. They are part of the environment forever. There is always a little scuttlebutt that suddenly we are going to cancel the funding. This is an important part of our essential frontline services. I would like to also indicate that we have committed $15 million for the new IPAs.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate each and every ranger right across Australia who are doing a wonderful job of looking after our environment and their land and country.

            This is an issue that has irked me and many in this area for some time. We have invested, I have indicated, since 2017 in Indigenous rangers, but it became apparent after a number of years, for whatever the reasons are, that the rangers were never going to get the similar powers of enforcement that the non-Indigenous rangers have. So we have made an investment of $30 million that is going to provide Indigenous rangers the same level of enforcement in fisheries, in wildlife, in border protection and in biosecurity protection that is enjoyed by any other notional manger in the mainstream area. This is going to close the divide, if you like, to ensure that Indigenous rangers have exactly the same rights to inquire why you have a rhinoceros in your glovebox, as any other mainstream ranger.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had a fantastic time with the Dhimurru rangers in Nhulunbuy. I have to commend again the remarkable work that they are doing in this area.

               Before we move forward with a $30 million investment, we wanted to ensure that this was the right way. We needed to find an appropriate way of bringing rangers up to the capacity to do that. So we had a $2 million specialised ranger program. I am pleased to announce that 28 rangers, particularly in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
                North Queensland
               </a>
               , are now working with Fisheries, with Biodiversity and with
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBRMPA" rel="nofollow">
                GBRMPA
               </a>
               as equals doing exactly the same roles as other rangers have done. We are moving particularly into the biodiversity space, which is a very important space in border security. If you match the cultural knowledge and that deep-seated knowledge of country, then who would be better placed to ensure that they are the frontline of our biosecurity protection for north Australia? This $2 million investment in a specialised Indigenous ranger program will deliver that.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am working right across portfolios to ensure that with any tasks that are done across the north of Australia or by Indigenous rangers we allow them to continue that work.
