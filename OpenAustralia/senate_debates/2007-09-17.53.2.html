        I refer to the Investigation Principles 2007, made under subsection 96-1 (1) of the Aged Care Act 1997.

 These Principles specify the process that the Secretary to the

         Department of Health and Ageing

        must undertake in investigating complaints or information regarding the responsibilities of a residential or community aged care provider.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subsection 16A.5(3) of these Principles states that an informant may ask the Secretary to the Department of Health and Ageing to keep confidential the identity of the informant, the identity of a person included in the information supplied to the Secretary, or any other details included in the information.

 Section 16A.9 requires the Secretary to comply with any request for confidentiality except where the Secretary considers that certain criteria are present.

 The section does not indicate whether the informant is to be notified that the request for confidentiality will not be complied with.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee

        therefore seeks your advice about whether such a requirement should be added to this section.

        Thank you for your letter of 14 June 2007, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulation and Ordinances, regarding the Investigation Principles 2007 (Investigation Principles) made under subsection 96-1(1) of the Aged Care Act 1997.

       <p class="italic">
        The Committee has requested further advice on subsection 16A.9 of the Investigation Principles which requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing to comply with an informant’s request to keep his or her identity or other details confidential, except where the Secretary considers that certain criteria are present. The Investigation Principles do not indicate whether the informant is to be notified that a request for confidentially will not be complied with.

       <p class="italic">
        As a matter of procedure, the Department will attempt to contact the informant, where possible, to notify him or her if a request for confidentially will not be complied with. A specific requirement for the Secretary to contact the informant was not included in the Investigation Principles as it would limit the capacity of the Secretary to act immediately in circumstances where the health, safety or wellbeing of the informant or care recipient may be at risk. In such circumstances, the Department will notify the informant of the Secretary’s actions.

        Thank you for your letter of 25 July 2007 responding to the Committee’s concerns with the Investigation Principles 2007 made under subsection 96-1(1) of the Aged Care Act 1997.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In your response you advise that the Department will attempt to contact an informant, where possible, to notify him or her if a request for confidentiality will be not complied with.

 The Committee is concerned that no details have been provided on what would constitute an attempt to contact an informant.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You further advise that a specific requirement to contact the informant was not included in the Principles as it would limit the capacity of the Secretary to act immediately where circumstances required.

 While the Committee acknowledges the need for urgent action in some situations, it suggests that this might be addressed by including a requirement that the Secretary will make all reasonable efforts to contact the informant in the circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a precautionary measure, the Committee has agreed to give a notice of motion to disallow these Principles on 15 August 2007 (the last day on which a notice may be given) to allow time for further correspondence on these matters.

        Dear Senator Watson
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 9 August 2007, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulation and Ordinances, regarding the Investigation Principles 2007 (Investigation Principles), made under subsection 96-1(1) of the Aged Care Act 1997.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Your letter was sent in response to my letter of 25 July 2007 responding to the Committee’s comments in relation to subsection 16A.9 of the Investigation Principles. This section provides that if a person gives information to the Aged Care Complaints Investigation Scheme (the Scheme) on a confidential basis then the Secretary to the Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) must keep such information confidential unless it will harm an investigation or otherwise pose risks to the informant or care recipient.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Where information is provided in confidence to the Scheme it is critical to the integrity of the complaints process that the confidentiality of the information is maintained as far as possible. However, it is equally recognised that there may be circumstances in which the informant, care recipient or others may face harm if the Scheme fails to release information to, for example, the approved provider, police or other investigating bodies. The most appropriate response by the Scheme will vary according to the particular case in question.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the difficulty of prescribing a ‘one size fits all’ approach in legislation, detailed guidelines have been developed on this issue. I have attached for your information a copy of an extract from the Scheme’s procedures manual (Attachment A). This manual is used by all officers that conduct investigations under the Scheme. This extract outlines the procedures that staff must follow when investigating confidential complaints, situations in which these confidential details would be disclosed and the process to follow when it is necessary to disclose confidential information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the Committee considers that, in addition to the information included in the manual, it would be useful to include further detail in the Principles, an amendment could be made to the Principles. This could expressly provide that the Secretary must make a reasonable attempt to advise the informant that the Secretary intends to use information given by the informant other than in accordance with the informant’s request for confidentiality. This power would continue to be limited to circumstances where the Secretary considers that complying with the request for confidentially will harm the investigation, place the safety, health or wellbeing of the informant or care recipient at risk or place the informant or a care recipient at risk of intimidation or harassment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the Committee believes there would be some merit in having the Department provide an additional oral briefing on this matter, I would be happy to arrange this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I trust that this information is of assistance and look forward to the Committee’s response.
       </p>

         Confidential Information

       </p>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Open
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In general all information and details provided on an open basis can be released to other relevant people to the case. There may, however, be some restrictions to the exchange of information if any of the relevant people request that some part of the information that they have provided is not released to the other people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Confidential
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When information is provided on a confidential basis, the identity and contact details of the informant are known to the Scheme. However, these details are not passed on to the approved provider or any other person involved in the case without the agreement of the informant.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You will need to advise a confidential informant that if they provide information confidentially, it may limit the scope of any investigation that the Scheme undertakes - for example, it may be difficult to investigate concerns in relation to an individual where the care recipient’s details are confidential. Providing confidential information still allows for the Scheme to keep the informant updated on the progress of the case.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Anonymous
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When information is provided on an anonymous basis, the identity and contact details of the informant will not be known to the Scheme. You will need to remind the informant that if they provide information anonymously, then no further contact can be made with them by the Scheme. Providing information anonymously may also limit the scope of any investigation that the Scheme undertakes e.g. it may be difficult to investigate concerns in relation to an individual where the care recipient’s details are anonymous.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the informant wishes to be kept updated on the progress of the case then they may wish to consider providing information on a confidential or open basis.

        2.3.4 Maintaining Confidentiality
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Section 16A.5 (3) of the Investigation Principles sets out the rights of persons contacting the Scheme to request confidentiality in relation to certain information. As such, all possible measures should be taken to ensure the confidentiality of care recipient/informant details when confidentiality has been requested. In order to the maintain confidentiality of the care recipient the following points must be considered:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         When conducting a site visit:
        </li>
        <li>
         request to view the files of several care recipients (e.g. look at the files for the confidential care recipient and four others)
        </li>
        <li>
         interview several care recipients (e.g. the care recipient in question and several others)
        </li>
        <li>
         ensure any paperwork containing the care recipient’s details is secure at all times (e.g. carry paperwork in a document holder, do not leave paperwork unattended).
        </li>
        <li>
         If it becomes evident that the service provider may attempt to identify who the care recipient/informant is, notify the informant (e.g. the confidential care recipient is identifiable as the only person in the home with a particular condition).
        </li>
        <li>
         If you are concerned about a matter relating to confidentiality speak to your manager.
        </li>

        2.3.5 Disclosing Confidential Details
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under section 16A.9 of the Investigation Principles the Secretary must ensure that any request for confidentiality under subsection 16A.5 (3) is complied with unless the Secretary considers that doing so will, or is likely to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        a)
   
 harm the investigation; or
       </p>

 place the informant or a care recipient at risk of intimidation or harassment.

       </p>

        Scenario: An informant calls to tell you that they have just visited their mother after an absence and are concerned that she has lost a lot of weight and doesn't seem to be being fed properly. They do not want the home to know they have called as they fear this may affect her care further.

        On investigation you find that, as described by the informant, the mother is not being fed properly and is losing weight. However she is the only care recipient in the home affected by this.

        Action: Contact the informant and encourage them to allow you to disclose the care recipient’s details to the home to ensure their mother receives appropriate care. If after repeated attempts to contact the informant you are unsuccessful then you will need to consider providing the care recipient’s details to the home even though this many not accord with the wishes of the informant. This decision should be made in consultation with your manager. If you determine that the care recipient’s details should be disclosed, then you should again attempt to contact the informant to advise them that you have disclosed their mother’s details to the home.

        Dear Minister
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 13 August 2007 in which you provide further information on the manner in which information provided in confidence to the Aged Care Complaints Investigation Scheme may be disclosed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In your response you advise that it is difficult to prescribe a ‘one size fits all’ approach in legislation that would cover all circumstances and that detailed guidelines have been developed to assist departmental officers to make decisions on a case by case basis.

 The Committee appreciates receiving a copy of the guidelines that relate specifically to the manner in which confidential information may be disclosed.

 This information was of great assistance to the Committee’s deliberations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recognises that legislation cannot cover all situations but remains concerned that there is no requirement to make every effort to contact the informant before the information is disclosed.

 In your response you offer to amend the Principles to expressly provide for the Secretary to make ‘a reasonable attempt’ to advise the informant.

 The Committee welcomes your offer but suggests that the amendment should require the Secretary to make ‘all possible attempts’ to advise the informant in keeping with the wording contained in the departmental guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee would therefore appreciate receiving a specific undertaking to amend the Principles along those lines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As advised in our letter of 9 August 2007, a notice of motion to disallow these Principles was given on Wednesday, 15 August 2007 to provide further time for consideration.

 The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but
        <b>
         before 10 September 2007
        </b>
        , to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Principles and to withdraw its notice of disallowance.

 Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

        Dear Senator Watson
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 16 August 2007 regarding the Investigation Principles 2007 (Investigation Principles), made under subsection 96-1(1) of the Aged Care Act 1997.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consistent with the Committee’s request to amend the Investigation Principles to require the Secretary to make ‘all possible attempts’ to advise the informant, before releasing confidential information that has been provided to the Aged Care Complaints Investigation Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIS" rel="nofollow">
         CIS
        </a>
        ) by the informant, I am proposing to amend the Investigation Principles and have included for your information a copy of the proposed amendments at Attachment A. [attachment not incorporated]
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As you will note, the amendment requires the Secretary to make ‘all reasonable attempts’ to contact the informant before releasing information which could identify the informant or care recipient. This wording has been developed on the advice of the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing (OLDP). The OLDP advised that it would not be appropriate to use the wording ‘make all possible attempts’ as the effect of this could be to frustrate the release of information unless the person could actually be contacted. It could be argued that a requirement to ‘make all possible attempts’ is unreasonable as there is no objective test for when sufficient attempts to contact the informant have been made. I note that the words ‘all possible attempts’ were inappropriately used in the guidelines for the CIS and it is proposed that this be amended to align with the amendment at Attachment A.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I trust that this information is of assistance and look forward to the Committee’s response.

          Purpose of the Bill
         </b>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The bill amends the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 to clarify that an Australian Crime Commission (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACC" rel="nofollow">
          ACC
         </a>
         ) examiner can record their reasons for issuing a summons or notice to produce after the summons or notice has been issued.

 The bill also provides that summonses or notices issued in the past are not invalid where reasons were recorded subsequent to issue.

 Further, the bill also provides that a summons or notice will not be invalid merely because it fails to comply with technical requirements in the Act.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         These aspects of the bill have been developed in response to findings made by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Justice Smith
         </a>
         of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
          Victorian Supreme Court
         </a>

          VSC
         </a>
         297, which was handed down on 23 August 2007.

 Justice Smith held that for a summons to be valid, reasons for issuing the summons must have been issued prior to the time it was actually issued.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The bill also makes minor amendments that would allow for a person to appear before, or produce documents to, an examiner who is not the same examiner who issued the summons or notice.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <b>
          Reasons for Urgency
         </b>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The findings of Justice Smith in ACC v Brereton have significant implications for current investigations/operations of the ACC, including matters that are currently before the courts.

 The bill ensures that summonses and notices that are being relied upon for current investigations/operations and prosecutions are not invalidated simply because reasons were issued after they were issued.

 If this is not addressed, it could call into jeopardy evidence taken in a substantial number of matters, including evidence being used in current prosecutions.

 It is important that this issue is resolved as soon as possible so that matters before the court are not unduly affected.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The decision also has significant operational implications for the ACC, particularly where summonses or notices need to be issued in urgent situations or where large numbers need to be issued simultaneously.
