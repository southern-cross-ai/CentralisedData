        My question is to Minister Fifield, representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Minister, Australia's population has now reached 25 million. If this year's federal budget papers are accurate, our immigration intake level will grow by nearly one million over the next four years. As of June 2018, the ABS estimated that our unemployment rate nationally is at 5.4 per cent; however, July 2018 figures from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Morgan_Research" rel="nofollow">
         Roy Morgan Research
        </a>
        suggest that the actual jobless rate is closer to 10 per cent. That means that one in every 10 Australians is out of work. At the same time, the new skilled occupation list for the immigration intake program has identified certain jobs that apparently not enough Australians are taking up. Can the minister confirm that Australia is facing such an imminent crisis that we need to import dog handlers as part of the skilled visa program? How many of these positions have been set aside?

         Thank you, Senator Georgiou, for your question. I can't speak directly to that particular visa category to which you made reference, so I would have to seek advice on that. But, Senator Georgiou, you are right that, based on estimates from the ABS, the Australian population did reach 25 million at 11 pm on Tuesday, 7 August 2018. That figure is an estimate of the resident population. It includes Australian citizens, Australian permanent residents and temporary visa holders and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealanders" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealanders
         </a>
         who have been in Australia for more than 12 months out of the last 16-month period. It is also important to note that at any one time there are over two million persons in Australia on a temporary visa, including over 550,000 international students and graduates, around 130,000 backpackers and around 670,000 New Zealanders.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important when we have immigration that we do ensure that we have appropriate investment in infrastructure. That's not something that has occurred in the past. I should also point out that the government is ensuring that our permanent migration program is managed in line with our interests and genuine needs. This means that 190,000 places available is set as a ceiling level and not as an arbitrary target to be achieved without reference to the needs of the community and the economy. Our predecessors oversaw record numbers of migrants coming to Australia and lowered the eligibility standards and moved places between visa categories to achieve the arbitrary targets. In contrast, we are reforming the permanent migration program to ensure that it is targeted, sustainable and delivering benefits.

           Is it true that Australia is also short of masseuses and that we need to import them from abroad? Will the influx of overseas massage therapists end happily for all Australians?

            Thank you, Senator Georgiou. Again, I would have to seek advice in relation to particular occupational categories. It is absolutely essential that we have public confidence in our visa programs. To maintain confidence, Australians need to know that these programs have integrity and work in their interests. This government approaches this area on the basis of skills and ensuring that the Australian economy has the skills that are needed to support productivity and growth.
