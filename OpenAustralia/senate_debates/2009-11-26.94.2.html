          And short, which may be generous in itself in relation to my speeches. I accept that interjection, Senator Evans. This legislation basically fixes up an error in the previous legislation. If the roles had been reversed, you could imagine the current minister, Senator Carr, coming in here ranting and raving at ministerial incompetence et cetera. I have been around long enough and observed myself long enough to know that from time to time, with all the best will in the world, errors are made. So I do not seek to condemn the minister, the government or the bureaucracy, because the real question is: how often are these sorts of errors made. In relation to this particular piece of legislation, the error would mean that the commencement of funding of support to the automotive industry would be delayed by some three months. There is no doubt the automotive sector is going through a very difficult period of time and that a delay of three months in payments would be highly disruptive to them with their cash management situation. Also, I think they are deserving of the security of what was intended.
         </p>
         <p>
          I must say that I did put it to one of the industry associations, somewhat tongue in cheek, that it is amazing when you have legislation throwing billions of dollars at an industry sector in that they do not seem to go through the legislation with the same fine toothcomb in the way they would if you were going to take something away from them. Because then they go through it chapter and verse, clause by clause and comma by comma to pick whatever holes they can in it. The industry association was gracious enough to accept that as a correct general comment. But, at the end of the day, can I indicate the coalitionâ€™s support for this amending legislation which simply fixes up errors that were inadvertently made. These amendments will allow the legislation to proceed as it was originally designed to proceed and as agreed by this Senate, as I recall, without division on the last occasion it was before the Senate. I therefore support the bill and wish the minister, if this is the last time I speak to him on this piece of legislation, and the industry, a very happy Christmas and a lot more profitable 2010.
