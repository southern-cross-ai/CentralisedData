        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Science, Minister Watt. The Albanese government went to the election promising to rebuild Australia's manufacturing capability and deliver a future made in Australia. We know this vision for our nation cannot be achieved without a safe and well-paid workforce. What will be the impact of Labor's tax cuts on Australian workers in the manufacturing industry?

         Thank you, Senator Pratt. I know you have had a very long history of supporting the manufacturing industry and manufacturing workers in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike those opposite, Senator Pratt—and everyone on this side of the chamber—believes in Australian manufacturing. We don't go around shutting down car industries and shutting down the manufacturing industry. We actually support manufacturing.

                As I was saying, unlike those opposite, who drove car manufacturing into the ground, we are taking action to help Australian business to grow, and we're making sure that manufacturing workers prosper at the same time. That's why we're taking such action on cost-of-living pressures and we're improving job security, and that is why we are giving Australian manufacturing workers a tax cut.
               </p>
               <p>
                What does it mean in practice? Well, Senator Pratt, you'd be aware—I'm sure you've had a Bundaberg ginger beer over the years. Let's look at that. It's a business that I know Senator Chisholm, as well, is very familiar with, in my state of Queensland.
               </p>
               <p>
                An entry level worker on the Bundaberg production line or in the brewhouse or in the warehouse—the people who make the magic happen—makes around $50,000 a year. With Labor's tax cuts, a worker at that plant will be $955 a year better off. Those opposite have been happy to accuse the government of stifling ambition, not believing in aspiration and discouraging workers from improving their lot in life. If that worker at Bundaberg gains the experience to get an even higher paid job at $65,000 a year, they will be over $1,300 a year better off as a result of Labor's tax cuts.

                   Thank you again, Senator Pratt. As we've indicated repeatedly, Labor stands for manufacturing workers and all workers to earn more and keep more of what they earn. I'm very pleased to inform Senator Pratt that it isn't just food and beverage manufacturing workers who will benefit from Labor's tax cuts; it is all manufacturing workers in my state of Queensland, in Senator Pratt's state of

                   To give you another example, workers at Capral Aluminium in Bremer near Ipswich in Queensland who work at the biggest aluminium extrusion plant in Australia making aluminium products for use as windows, doors, ute trays and much more will also benefit from Labor's tax cuts. A full-time entry level production worker at the Capral plant currently makes around $52,000 a year. They will enjoy more than $1,000 from Labor's tax cuts. With a pay rise through gaining extra expertise and earning up to $73,000, they will get more than $1,500 a year from Labor's tax cuts. Our tax cuts are good for workers in manufacturing.

                     When Labor's tax cut policy was announced, without even seeing the details, those opposite promised to fight this legislation through the House of Representatives and the Senate, saying, 'We're not prepared to give up on this.' Minister, why is it so important that manufacturing workers benefit from Labor's tax cuts?

                      Again, manufacturing workers had to suffer too long under a coalition government—in fact, 10 years too long—seeing industry wound down, seeing their wages suppressed and seeing their jobs become insecure. That is changing under the Labor Party. Manufacturing workers are finally getting the respect they deserve, and now they will be better off thanks to Labor's tax cuts. But that isn't all that we've been doing in this space since coming to government.
                     </p>

                      Across the manufacturing industry, workers are earning more since Labor came to government. The average full-time earnings for manufacturing workers since Labor came to office are up by $145 a week. There are also more manufacturing workers since Labor came to power—more than 85,000 additional secure, well-paid jobs in manufacturing, many of them in outer suburban and regional communities. Thanks to Labor's tax cuts, a worker earning the average full-time manufacturing wage will be nearly $1,900 better off. Under Labor you'll earn more and keep more of what you earn.
