           Senator Sterle says, 'Rubbish!' Why did he go to the 2010 election promising no carbon tax and then to the 2013 election saying that the carbon tax had been abolished? Why did you say that? The reason is: you know it is job destroying and you know it is economy destroying and it does nothing for the environment.

             a fresh start on 5 April. That would be a fair request if there were a fresh suite of policies being offered to the people of Western Australia, but it is all the old, stale policies of the defeated Labor government that are being served up yet again to the people of Western Australia: a commitment to the carbon tax, a commitment to the mining tax, a commitment to defending the out-of-control

              CFMEU
             </a>
             and a commitment to green and red tape. I simply remind those opposite that the Labor Party cannot have its Senate lead candidate in Western Australia saying the carbon tax is gone and then his very own leader and all the Labor senators, including the

               The government has inherited a Green-Labor legacy of an additional 200,000 unemployed Australians, $667 billion in projected gross debt, $123 billion in cumulative deficits and the world's biggest carbon tax. So it is absolutely vital that the

                Western Australia

               n economy be unshackled from this legacy of debt, from this legacy of unemployment, and that is why it is important to ensure that the coalition's policies to create the jobs are implemented. We invite the Labor senators from Western Australia and the Greens senator from Western Australia to make that happen here and now, today, by voting to ensure the abolition of the carbon tax and the abolition of the mining tax.

                 taxes. Labor's lead Senate candidate, Joe Bullock, sought to deceive Western Australians by claiming that Labor are scrapping the carbon tax. If Labor are scrapping the carbon tax, why are they voting to stop its repeal in this place? What we have is Labor betraying the people of Western Australia when they introduced the carbon tax in the first place, then deceiving the people of Australia when they claimed that they had repealed it, and now Labor are adding insult to injury by refusing to pass the wishes of the people of Australia, and especially the people of Western Australia, who want these job-destroying taxes removed so that their economy can grow and so that those who are on the unemployment list can gain jobs.
