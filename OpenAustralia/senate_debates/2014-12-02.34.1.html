        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Minister, why were two pregnant mothers, who are now in immigration detention in Darwin after spending more than three days detained on a bus, brought to Australia from the Nauruan community where they had been residing on valid refugee visas?

         I have to say it is an absolute delight to have a question from Senator Hanson-Young, because I actually thought she had been benched for some time. It is good to know, Senator Hanson-Young, that you are back in the fray and you are back off the bench—which is great.

             I can advise the Senate as follows. I can confirm that there was an incident that occurred at the Blaydin Point
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APOD" rel="nofollow">
              APOD
             </a>
             following the medical transfer from Nauru. For a period of time, the two family groups were refusing to exit the transfer bus and take up their planned accommodation at the Blaydin facility. The incident has now been resolved with all individuals now settled in appropriate accommodation in Darwin.
            </p>
            <p>
             The women and their families were temporarily transferred to Australia—to respond directly to Senator Hanson-Young's question—for medical purposes. The families hold Nauruan visas and have been settled in that country. They do not hold an Australia visa. The families were informed by their case manager that they would be detained while in Australia. The information was provided to them prior to their medical transfer from Nauru.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two

             </a>
             midwives have been monitoring the women, and staff continue to engage with the individuals and provide appropriate support and services. So—to answer Senator Hanson-Young's question—they have been transferred to Australia for medical assistance, which we are giving them.

              , I ask a supplementary question. I put to the minister that immigration detention is not an appropriate place for women who are soon to expect their babies. What visas were the two women brought to Australia on? Can the minister confirm that the immigration department cancelled these visas? If so, why and when?

                    , I ask a final supplementary question. The women would have been brought to Australia on a visa, thus the reason they are allowed to be brought into the country. If so, when was this visa issued? When was it cancelled? What type of visa was it? Furthermore, can the minister confirm why these women are being held in immigration detention when legally there is no basis for it? Immigration detention is only for the purposes of deportation or issuing a visa.

                     Again, Senator Hanson-Young has watched one too many episodes of

                     ; a little bit of knowledge can sometimes be quite dangerous. Senator Hanson-Young, they were transferred to Australia. Being found to be refugees by Nauru does not affect their status as unauthorised maritime arrivals in Australia, which is why there is the approach of detaining the families until they are returned to Nauru. Senator Hanson-Young, you may not like the processes that this government follows, but—given that we have effectively stopped the boats, given that we have stopped the drownings at sea, given that, unlike Senator Hanson-Young and the government she supported, we are taking action to get children out of detention—I will stand by our policies every time.
