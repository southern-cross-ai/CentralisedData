        There are a number of amendments before the chamber, which we'll go into in a little bit of detail. But I want to start with some questions in response to an assertion that Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAllister" rel="nofollow">
         McAllister
        </a>
        made in her second reading contribution yesterday—that this sea dumping bill that we have before us today hasn't been brought forward to help facilitate an individual project. I don't have the exact words from
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        , Senator McAllister, so you'd be welcome to correct anything I said there. But I think you were very clear that any potential projects were a long way away and that this has nothing to do with an individual project. So, I just wanted to start by asking some simple questions around that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is the minister aware of any existing oil and gas projects or proposed oil and gas projects in Australian waters that are seeking transboundary waste or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
         CO2
        </a>
        movements into carbon capture and storage? That is, are there any projects in Australia, existing or proposed, that have formally, informally or even publicly raised the prospect of wanting to pump their CO2—their carbon—into reservoirs across our national boundaries into foreign waters?

But, as I indicated—or tried to indicate—in my second reading remarks, the nature of the framework that would be legislated if the bill before us passed would require, in accordance with the terms of the London protocol, bilateral agreement to be established between the two nations where a transboundary movement was proposed. It was on that basis that I made I think the self-evident point that that would take some time.

          Thank you, Minister. I noticed in your response there that you didn't mention the proposed Barossa project or, for example, the Sunrise project, which borders Australian territory and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
           East Timorese

          territory. So, could I ask you to clarify whether it's your understanding that the Barossa project, with its various investors, have raised this transboundary prospect?

           In referring to Timor-Leste's interest in establishing arrangements within their own territories, I implicitly sought to refer to Barossa. I apologise if that seemed incomplete to you. As I've indicated, though, the terms of the London protocol would require this bilateral agreement to be established with Timor-Leste, or any other country where a transborder movement was proposed.

            Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds to me like you are putting Timor-Leste and their government at the centre of this. So they're the ones proposing to take Barossa's dirty
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
             CO2

            and Woodside's dirty CO2 from the Sunrise project? Is that correct? Timor-Leste are the ones driving this process of exporting Australian pollution to their boundaries?

             project. Minister Wong has visited Timor-Leste and indicated that we would support their ambition. We're waiting to confirm their proposed next steps on that project. We would be guided by their priorities. That is of course entirely appropriate. We respect their right to make sovereign decisions about inward investment.

              Fair enough, but I can't imagine they, for example, requested that the Australian parliament pass this sea-dumping protocol, the London protocol, to help facilitate a project in their national interest. Presumably we're going through this process now so Australian companies, with Australian investments, can import—you mentioned a few examples there—or export our pollution across national boundaries. Is the minister aware that the Japanese investors in the Barossa project have raised this with the Australian government several times? Is that the minister's understanding?

               The first half of your contribution went to motivation and why the government might be taking the steps that we're taking in introducing this bill. I will reiterate the proposition that I put in the second reading speeches. This bill seeks to implement amendments that have been made to the London protocol, to which Australia is a signatory. The
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Protocol" rel="nofollow">
                London Protocol
               </a>
               to the Convention on the Prevention of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Pollution" rel="nofollow">
                Marine Pollution
               </a>
               by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter was amended in 2009 and then again in 2013, to make provision for transborder movement of carbon dioxide and to create a framework to manage the placement of wastes or other matter for legitimate marine geoengineering scientific research activities. As parties to the protocol, we are seeking to implement the legislative arrangements that would allow us to respond to these amendments that have been made to the protocol. This is a longstanding process. It has been under consideration within the formal processes of the government and the parliament for some time. I understand it was considered by JSCOT in 2020. It is a longstanding piece of work that is consistent with our international contributions to a shared approach to managing marine environments. As I said in my second reading speech, if the bill were not introduced, there would be no regulatory framework to deal with these kinds of issues at all.
              </p>
              <p>
               The consequence of that is that operators, researchers and proponents could start looking for loopholes and create their own initiatives and their own frameworks without government oversight, and that is the motivation for the government bringing the bill forward.
              </p>
              <p>
               You asked about representations from the Japanese government—no, my apologies. I apologise, Senator Whish-Wilson; could you repeat the second half of your question?

                 Perhaps, Senator Whish-Wilson, I can answer it this way: yes, I am aware of the public discussion that has taken place. I don't have at hand details of every interaction that may have taken place between ministers in this government or previous governments with individual countries. But, yes, as you indicate, there has been public discussion by companies about their interests.

                  Thank you, Minister. Perhaps I'll step through this with you then, because I think a lot of that information is publicly available and has been reported on by the media. I'll get back to the Sunrise project and Woodside's comments, which have been made over a number of years, because as I'm sure you're aware the Sunrise project is a very complicated one. The energy economics of it aren't that straightforward.

                  Let's just deal with the Barossa project for a moment. Once the safeguard legislation was passed by this chamber, there was what was described by the media as a 'broadside' by a number of Japanese investors into the changes to the safeguard mechanism and how they might impact investment in their Barossa project. I think they described it in the strongest possible terms as 'a betrayal' of the relationship between Australia and Japan, which obviously put significant pressure on your government, including various ministers. For example,

                  chief executive as well as comments from various companies. Part of that article was clearly referring to a request to the federal government from Japan—and I presume that's the Japanese government—that the Australian government exempt Santos's $5.8 billion Barossa gas project in the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Sea" rel="nofollow">

                  </a>
                  from the safeguard mechanism. He then asked that the Albanese government help Japanese operators pay for carbon credits or develop carbon storage that they would need to meet the new emissions targets. I reiterate that this was on 5 July. In that same article, a spokeswoman for energy and climate change minister Chris responded:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  … the government was investing in the regulation and administration of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), which would help operators earn carbon credits under the safeguard mechanism.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  …   …   …
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  "While the safeguard mechanism provides an incentive for new CCUS projects to meet abatement goals, it also opens the possibility for the earning of Safeguard Mechanism Credits if CCUS projects are successful in lowering emissions below baselines," …
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This article also references concerns raised directly with the Albanese government in March—that's three months prior to that—by
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INPEX" rel="nofollow">

                  Corporation about changes around Australia's energy and carbon policy. So that was on 5 July.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Not long after that, it was reported in a number of news articles that the Minister for
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
                   Climate Change
                  </a>
                  and Energy, Mr Chris Bowen had—following this broadside, this accusation of betrayal by the Australian government—headed to Japan in an attempt to repair bilateral relations after officials in Tokyo voiced concerns around Australia's future as a reliable LNG gas exporter. The article I am referring to here—and I can provide the minister with a copy of it—was by Amanda Battersby out of Singapore. She got a quote from APPEA that said:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  "Proximity lowers emissions from transportation, while the upcoming large-scale implementation of [carbon capture, utilisation and storage] will lower well-to-ship emissions," …
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  and they talked up the need for more investment in CCUS.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A day after these articles, on 25 July, Michael Smith, North Asia correspondent, clearly got access to Minister Bowen directly, following his coverage of this broadside by the Japanese government and Japanese investors. This article said Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen had told Japan and
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
                   South Korea
                  </a>
                  there would be no exemptions from Labor's emissions policy, and that he doesn't believe it threatens their energy security or trading relationships. But:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  Mr Bowen also said Labor supported special legislation that would allow Santos to send carbon dioxide from its $5.8 billion Barossa project across an international border to the Timor Sea. He acknowledged the project, which Japan wants to be exempted from the new rules, was reliant on carbon capture utilisation and storage.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Minister: is this legislation and the timing of this legislation designed to facilitate the Barossa gas project as was stated by Mr Chris Bowen?

                   I've already answered the question by explaining to you that the government's motivation in bringing forward the legislation is to meet our obligations as a party to the London protocol, to participate in global efforts to establish regulatory frameworks that are predictable and certain, and to meet environmental standards that have been agreed with our global partners. I think your question and its very long preamble seek to draw a link between the safeguard mechanism—which imposes stringent obligations on large projects, including gas projects—and carbon capture and storage. In many ways, that's quite straightforward, isn't it? The
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEA" rel="nofollow">
                    IEA
                   </a>
                   makes it very clear that
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCS" rel="nofollow">
                    CCS
                   </a>
                   will be a part of the broad mix of technologies necessary to make it to net zero. Those broad conclusions are echoed by the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
                    IPCC
                   </a>
                   and most other international energy analyses of our potential pathways to net zero, and Australia doesn't dispute this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I guess the question, which will be a product of the changing role and cost profiles of different technologies, is which of the various technologies available to us will prevail in what the relative weight of different technologies on our path to net zero looks and feels like. We are focused, in our role as government, on making sure that projects that are investable and that are deemed to be commercial by proponents have regulatory certainty now that they face these emissions constraints that you referred to in your preamble. Ratifying the London protocol's amendments is part of our broader approach to CCS and CCUS regulation. It's pragmatic and sensible. We made $12 million available in the last budget to review the environmental management regime for offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This review seeks to ensure that the regulatory regime for offshore CCS projects appropriately manages risks to the marine environment and to workforce health and safety. The review will identify opportunities to more effectively plan for and regulate the decommissioning of offshore CCS projects. It will look at regulatory requirements relating to long-term liability and monitoring of sequestered carbon dioxide and will examine opportunities to provide greater regulatory and administrative certainty and efficiency for carbon capture and storage projects in Commonwealth waters. So if your question is, 'Does the government consider that CCS may play a role in supporting covered entities to meet their obligations under the safeguard agreement?' the answer is yes.

                      That isn't where Mr Bowen finished in this article, by the way. On the second page, when dealing with accusations around the Japanese government's concerns, especially in relation to one investor, JERA, the article said of Mr Bowen:

                      Mr Bowen is then quoted as saying:

                      "We have introduced the legislation to enable that to occur …

                     <p class="italic">
                      We think that is fair. If we are requiring companies to meet ambitious emissions reduction targets, and they have a way to do it, we can help them achieve it. That legislation is making its way through parliament."

                     <p>

                       For perhaps the fifth time now, I reiterate the motivation for the government in bringing this forward and I reiterate my earlier answer, too, which is that the government does believe that
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCS" rel="nofollow">
                        CCS
                       </a>
                       has a role to play in allowing companies to meet the obligations that are placed on them under the safeguard legislation.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This chamber had an extensive debate about imposing obligations on projects that emitted large volumes of emissions. Your party voted for those requirements to be placed on large projects. This government accepts that, in some examples, it may be that a CCS project is the means by which those projects meet their obligations.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       If they seek to do so through that technology, if that's cost-effective and commercial and stacks up for them in the context of their project, then, yes, we want it to be properly regulated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I'll go back to the effect of the legislation before us. It puts in place the framework set out in the London protocol, and that framework requires a number of important environmental protections and other kinds of assessments to take place before any permit may be issued in relation to the transborder movement of carbon dioxide. It also requires an agreement to be put in place between the two countries that would be impacted by any such movement. These are important baseline regulatory arrangements that are necessary to respond to the possibility of projects of this kind. In the absence of these kinds of regulatory arrangements, we have an unregulated space, and I challenge you to explain why that would be a better outcome than having a clear regulatory environment that implements the environmental protections that the countries of the world have agreed to when they signed onto the London protocol.

                        We'll certainly get to that, Minister. I'll take up that challenge, because my understanding is if we're going to be dumping it in someone else's national territory we have no regulatory oversight over that at all, and I'm very keen to hear how you're going to actually regulate another country's carbon capture and storage project even if Australian pollution is going to it. But we'll get to that in a minute.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I note again, Minister, this the sixth time I've asked you this question that you've refused to answer: is this legislation before us today the special legislation Mr Bowen has alluded to on more than one occasion? This is just one article—I've got others here—where he's made it very clear that the government is going to be passing enabling legislation to facilitate the Barossa Gas Project. Clearly, he said, 'We have introduced the legislation to enable that to occur specifically related to the Barossa project'—the $5.8 billion Barossa project. You've refused to answer that. I don't know why. I think it's pretty obvious: it doesn't look good for your government that you're refusing to answer the most simple question. I think a bit of honesty and transparency goes a long way. It's not a gotcha moment; I think this is pretty black and white.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Let me try a different tack. If you genuinely don't know, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you don't know that this is the legislation Mr Bowen is referring to to facilitate the transport of

                        . This was in July, and it's been going through the House and of course it's here now. I can't see any other legislation before us that might be doing that, so an intelligent person would say, 'Yes, this must be it.' Perhaps you could offer what other legislation is the minister referring to there if it's not this?

                         I'll provide an answer for the seventh time, Senator Whish-Wilson, which comprehensively answers the question you're putting to me. The motivation for bringing forward the legislation is to implement the London protocol. It's a policy reform that's been going on for some time. Australia supported both of the amendments that I referred to earlier at the time that they were agreed by the London protocol contracting parties back in 2009 and 2013. Then, in 2020, JSCOT recommended that these were minor treaty actions and that binding treaty action may be taken.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I've also made it clear that the government is in the process of improving and strengthening and clarifying the regulatory arrangements that exist for carbon capture and storage and that the legislation before you is part of a broader suite of actions being undertaken by this government to do that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         It's quite clear that the arrangements we are putting in place support projects of the kind that you describe. It is logically true. What I'm not going to do is comment on comments made by other ministers when I am not in a position to know what was in their minds at the time that they made them, but you may proceed on the basis that the motivation for this is to implement our international obligations and to create a predictable, certain and robust regulatory framework for any projects of this kind that are proposed.

                          Minister, do you have one of Mr Bowen's advisers with you today? Could you answer that question, please? Could you get me an answer rather than avoiding it for the seventh time? I am allowed a second question. I'll try a different tact to get an answer to a very simple question, even though I suspect you know the answer. Has the environment minister's office been in discussions with Mr Bowen's office about the timing of this legislation and the drafting of this legislation to facilitate the Barossa gas project—or not even to facilitate the Barossa gas project but just discussions in Mr Bowen's office about this?

                               Senator Hanson-Young, I wonder if you could be more specific? I imagine that in any conversation that a minister would have with stakeholders, they may provide a range of information to those stakeholders about the content of the legislation that's proposed. If there was something more specific you were seeking, I may be more successful in providing a response.

                                     I understand that the matter you're raising now is also reflected in amendments that you've circulated in the chamber that pursue the same issues. The advice we received from the department is that those amendments are not required, because the effect of those is already reflected in the legislation. I can step through that in a moment. It would require me to find the relevant piece of paper. Essentially, as I understand it, your proposed amendment seeks to replicate matters which are laid out in the protocol itself. The advice from the department is that that is redundant and that repeating it in our legislation risks having our legislation become outdated should the protocol itself be updated. The legislation as proposed before the chamber at the moment references back to the London protocol and the documents that are attached to it, and it's for that reason that we don't consider it is legally required in the legislation we're now considering.

                                        That's very interesting. I appreciate the honesty. This minister may not be aware that the environment minister's office had given undertakings to third parties that they would. Here we have just one example of how badly this government has managed this piece of legislation; how appallingly the environment minister has treated the environment sector and those concerns about this issue. For months and months the environment minister's office has been telling environmental groups, community interested organisations and stakeholders that she was busy convincing her colleagues that this bill required amendment. How is anyone meant to believe what comes out of that minister's office from here on in?
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        I've got a raft of other issues which I think it would be helpful to have some clarity on as to whether there was any work done by the minister's office or the department in relation to fixing up and improving this piece of legislation. Could the minister please inform the Senate what, if any, amendments were being considered by the department or the minister's office to deal with the concerns raised by civil society and interested stakeholders?

                                         I understand that the minister's office has—you're right—been engaged with a range of civil society groups and also that those civil society groups engaged with the Senate inquiry, and we're grateful for both of those efforts. We always appreciate hearing from the environment groups. The minister's office did seek advice from the department about many of the amendments that were proposed, either directly or through the Senate inquiry processes, and has come to the conclusion, on a range of matters, including the one that you raised in your earlier question, that amendments to the bill are not required, because the way the bill is drafted references so directly to the London protocol that replicating the features of the London protocol in the legislation itself is not necessary and has no additional benefits but does in fact introduce legal risks.

JSCOT considered it in 2020, and the drafting to implement that JSCOT recommendation was initiated under the previous government.

                                                      That's unfortunate—or convenient, depending on your position, I guess. Could I ask if the minister for environment sought advice from her department about certain amendments, as referenced. We've heard just now that a number of amendments were considered, which the department looked at, advised on, went back to the minister with and gave the minister advice about. I want to know whether any other ministers within the Albanese government were also given advice about these possible amendments.

                                                       Senator Hanson-Young, there are limits to my personal knowledge of all of the conversations that take place between all of the ministers, but of course ministers discuss policy matters that are before them. This is a bill that interacts with other portfolios. I am advised that Minister Plibersek and her staff have engaged with their colleagues, as you would expect, in relation to this bill. But the government doesn't propose to bring forward amendments to this bill. We've contemplated the many options that have been proposed by participants in the public debate around this bill and have concluded that we are satisfied with the bill as it is presented and as it is before you now in the Senate.

I was wondering if this might have something to do with the timing of this bill, Minister, and I'd like to get your view on this. On 8 October, it was reported that Australia and Japan had met to pledge deeper cooperation on energy security and climate change during high-level government talks, where Labor sought to reassure Tokyo that future

He discussed Labor's emissions reduction rules on future LNG projects, including the safeguard mechanism, and he discussed a number of issues, including CCUS, in talks with our trade minister, Senator Don Farrell, our energy minister, Mr Chris Bowen, and our resources minister, Ms Madeleine King. Interestingly, although he had previously raised concerns, which I mentioned in my earlier questions about Australia's relationship with Japan, these concerns weren't raised again following this meeting. In fact, he made a comment that, following the meeting with Senator Farrell, Mr Bowen and Ms King, he was now confident of a win-win scenario between Japan and Australia in relation to LNG investment.

Were you aware of those talks, and was the timing of those talks anything to do with the introduction of this bill through the Senate this week?

                                                             Thanks very much, Senator Whish-Wilson. Yes, I was aware that an extremely important meeting was taking place between the Japanese minister and three Australian ministers. And that is entirely appropriate; we have a deep and longstanding partnership, as energy exporters to them, with the nation of Japan. It's a really valuable partnership for Australia. Incidentally, it's by that well-practised pathway over many years in that business and diplomatic relationship which, potentially, lays the foundation for some of the emerging industries that may prove very important for Australia and for the globe—particularly in relation to the production of hydrogen and its derivatives. So, yes, of course we pay attention to and invest in the relationship with Japan. I'm not aware of all the details that were discussed in that meeting between those ministers, but I am pleased that the outcome of those discussions was positive. Of course it's an important relationship and of course this government will invest time in it.

                                                             You're going back again now for, I think, the eighth—or possibly the ninth—time to the question of motivation for the bill. I have laid it out so very clearly that I'm not sure whether it really assists the Senate for me to go over it again.

To start with the technology: for many years now, for reasons that are actually unrelated to climate action, oil and gas projects have, for various reasons, been operationally required to eject carbon dioxide into geological formations. The advice I have is that the experience through the oil and gas sector is that the placement of carbon dioxide into geological formations is relatively stable. There's been discussion now for some decades about whether a process of this kind could be used to take carbon dioxide that's produced as a by-product of energy generation activities or industrial activities and similarly store it underground so as to prevent it being released into the atmosphere. The reason for doing so would be to minimise the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and the reason we seek to do that is the relationship between the release of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere and global warming.
                                                                </p>
                                                                <p>
                                                                 The regulatory environment is important because there are a range of impacts that you might need to consider when you're undertaking projects of that kind. They would be, potentially, impacts on the marine environment, impacts on worker health and safety and other kinds of questions that might be necessary to manage if you were undertaking a project of any kind. It's important to have clear how those issues would be managed for projects of this kind. Australia has its own regulatory arrangements for projects of this kind that are conducted within Australian waters. The bill before us seeks to create a framework to establish the regulatory environment where there is a transboundary movement of carbon dioxide from one territory to another.

Basically the bill allows the government to create a regulatory system to place waste into the sea for scientific research purposes—for example, research into ocean fertilisation which aims to remove carbon dioxide from the ocean. Of our carbon dioxide, only three per cent is created by humans; 97 per cent of carbon dioxide comes from the oceans, from the soils and from natural resources. I just don't understand why you're going to take carbon dioxide—it's a natural gas which is 0.004 per cent of all the natural gases in the world, and you're actually terrified and taking it out, and you're going to have to pump it into the seabed. I'm sorry, but I don't understand what your regulatory system is here. You're saying that it's going to help our environment. Usually, when the oceans will release carbon dioxide and take it in depends on the heating and cooling of our oceans. So how is this going to actually help?

One is projects associated with carbon capture and storage in undersea formations. This was the subject of a 2009 amendment to the London protocol, and the legislation seeks to create a regulatory arrangement for that when it requires the transborder movement of carbon dioxide.
                                                                    </p>

It relates to marine geoengineering activities. This allows for the placing of waste or other matter for a marine geoengineering activity such as ocean fertilisation, for legitimate scientific research. It's a really important point, because it's for research purposes only. It's not imagined that it would be permitted at anything like commercial scale at this point in time.
                                                                    </p>
                                                                    <p>
                                                                     One of the technologies that people are interested in investigating is ocean fertilisation. There are good reasons to regulate that, because we're not yet certain what kinds of impacts that ocean fertilisation might have in addition to its climate benefits. We should always be cautious about these technologies. It's at research scale, and the amendment before us seeks to create a regulatory framework to manage research projects of that kind.
                                                                    </p>
                                                                    <p>
                                                                     I will indicate that the London protocol is also looking at potential other future listings, including microbubbles—injecting tiny bubbles into the ocean surface to increase sunlight reflectivity—and marine cloud brightening, or seeding, which is injecting sea salt into cloud updrafts to reflect sunlight back into space. These are all research propositions. They're not commercial. But it is important that there is a regulatory framework to manage them so that we don't have unintended consequences on ocean environments. Because the ocean is a shared resource, it makes sense that that's done through an international protocol.
                                                                    </p>

Globally, I understand, there are around 35 commercial

But, if they don't use it, then there are repercussions to them. Basically you're introducing this if they want to carry on a business here in Australia. Is that the case? Do they have a choice to do carbon capture if they want to do oil or gas in Australia? Do they have to do to this carbon capture, otherwise they won't be given a licence to get oil and gas in Australia?

Some months ago we had a debate in this chamber about the safeguard mechanism. I'm not sure if you were here for that debate. At that time we made arrangements to establish binding emissions constraints on large Australian projects, and those projects are responsible for coming to their own commercial decisions about how best to reduce the emissions from their projects.

And that's assuming you can find the right geologic conditions that are stable enough over millennia so that carbon doesn't leak out and back into the atmosphere.

                                                                            </p>

For context, the world emitted 39.4 billion, with a 'b', tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2021. That is roughly 1,000 times greater than what's possible to capture with current CCS technology. Put another way, CCS plants can only offset around 0.1 per cent of global carbon emissions each year.
                                                                            </p>

Industry groups estimate that between 655 billion and 1.28 trillion is required to make this a reality. Aside from the trillion-dollar price tag, it's critical to realise that CCS projects take around 10 years to progress through concept, feasibility, design and construction phases before becoming operational—time that we simply don't have.

It also delays facing the reality that we must stop burning fossil fuels—we need to take serious action and not rely on unproven technology to save the day. As people in climate justice circles like to say, "delay is the new denial." We need to turn the tap off new carbon emissions and start mopping up the damage.

Senator Pocock, since people were being nice about me earlier, I will say also that I recognise that this is an area of sincere interest for you and many other senators in this chamber. It should be, because we are in the critical decade and, if we don't get it right between now and 2030, we'll face some very significant challenges in the decades ahead. It's for that reason that we have come to government with an absolute determination to decarbonise our economy.
                                                                             </p>

I would accept your argument if the policy position of the government was to rely exclusively on CCS, but that's not the policy position of the government. In fact, over the period we have been in office, we have taken a range of steps to reduce our emissions in a range of sectors, using a range of different technologies and tools. It starts with enhancing our near-term ambition and legislating both our 2030 and our 2050 targets. It includes the public investments that we are making in the infrastructure to enable significantly greater renewables in our own electricity system. It includes the steps that we are taking to facilitate electric vehicles and their use in this country and to make Australia an attractive destination for the countries that are producing electric vehicles, including, incidentally, some of the countries with whom we do the greatest trade in energy. It includes the development of a robust framework for the land sector so that the sequestration possibilities that are present in nature based solutions and in biodiversity can be realised.
                                                                             </p>

But the point I am making to you is that this is a very challenging period for humanity and it's a challenging period for governments, but we have to tackle it. To do so, we will need every tool at our disposal.
                                                                             </p>

It may be that some proponents choose to use CCS as a response to those constraints. If they do so, they should, I think you would agree, do so in a well-regulated environment. That's what this bill seeks to contribute to, along with the other steps that we are taking to strengthen the regulatory arrangements around the CCS projects that may take place in Australian waters. But it has this constraint on it. It needs to stack up commercially for the proponents. They need to make decisions about which technologies are going to work for them as they make their transition towards net zero.
                                                                             </p>

                                                                              I understand why senators would like to have the widest possible debate about our path to net zero and the widest possible debate about climate change.
                                                                             </p>

It is a bill that seeks to ratify an international convention that exists to create a standardised approach between countries about how we'll manage a shared ocean resource. As part of that protocol, it seeks to establish the arrangements that will be put in place where there is a transborder movement of carbon dioxide. I personally would prefer the transborder movements of carbon dioxide to be regulated if they are going to occur, and it's on that basis that I do sincerely support the legislation that's before us.
                                                                             </p>
                                                                             <p>
                                                                              I thank senators for their contributions to date. I don't labour under any delusion that we are about to finish any time soon, but I say this: these things aren't mutually exclusive. Of course we have to pay attention to renewables. Of course we have to work on increasing the uptake and the availability of electric vehicles. Of course we have to work on the land sector. Of course we have to work on the technologies that will support our heaviest industries. While we do it, incidentally, we should pay attention to all of the communities around the country that are absolutely dependent on us getting this transition right so that we can create sustainable, secure jobs that keep people healthy and happy as we head towards 2050. There are heaps of opportunities there, and we're determined to grasp them. The idea that passing this bill will stop any of those other things from happening is simply wrong.

Faced with those things absolutely being mutually exclusive, I'd also like to say the IPCC says that adaptation beyond two degrees is going to be incredibly difficult, if not bordering on impossible, for many parts of the world. If that is the case, will the government explicitly rule out the use of this sea-dumping legislation being used by new projects to offset their scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and essentially new projects happening under the safeguard mechanism? Will be government rule that out?
