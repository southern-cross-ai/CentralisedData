         Thank you very much, Senator Paterson. This gives me the opportunity, by the way, to congratulate you on that superb maiden speech last night. It is great to be joined on this side of the chamber by another great champion of liberty. Senator Paterson, the question you posed is very appropriate. It is very appropriate, indeed, on this last sitting day of the autumn sittings to reflect on the many important initiatives that the Turnbull government has announced in only the last seven weeks since parliament returned from the summer recess.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 25 February we had the defence white paper announced by the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister, in which the government committed to delivering a more potent, agile and engaged
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         ready to respond whenever our interests are threatened and our help is needed—a once-in-a-generation statement of Australian defence policy, widely praised and well received by all commentators; a real landmark achievement of the defence minister, Senator Payne.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meanwhile, on 1 March, more recently, the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield, announced that the government would introduce the most significant reforms in a generation to our media laws, supporting the viability of our local organisations as they face increasing competition from a rapidly changing digital landscape. These reforms will result in major changes to the regulations governing the control and ownership of Australia's traditional media outlets and the provision of local television content in regional Australia—once again, a once-in-a-generation reform pioneered by the Turnbull government, pioneered by ministers in this government, which eluded previous governments, that have been the subject of announcement in recent weeks. And, if Senator Paterson cares to enquire further, I will be able to inform him further of other announcements the government has lately made.

           To further the story of the major reform announced in recent weeks by the Turnbull government: as recently as yesterday the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer announced that the government will legislate to fix competition policy in Australia through the implementation of the Harper review's recommendations to reform section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act, which, as you know, Senator Paterson, is the misuse of market power provision. Those reforms will include the introduction of an effects test to limit the potential misuse of market power and to ensure a better deal for consumers and a better deal for small businesses. This is something that has been debated for years—indeed, for decades—and we have now announced the reforms for which Australians have been waiting for so long. And, as you know, Senator Paterson, before the chamber at this very moment is the Senate voting reform legislation—a fundamental piece of institutional reform also pioneered in recent weeks by the Turnbull government.

             Indeed there are risks to a more prosperous and secure Australia, Senator Paterson, and you can see them before you on the frontbench of the opposition. It is those who are braying and caterwauling because they cannot face the fact that in six years they did nothing yet in the last six weeks the Turnbull government—on four different fronts that I mentioned in answer to your earlier question—has made landmark, once-in-a-generation reforms.
            </p>

             We do know what the

              Australian Labor Party
             </a>
             stands for, because Mr Shorten announced at the beginning of last year that 2015 would be the year of ideas. And some of us—including me, I must confess—were cynical enough to say, 'There will be no ideas!' But we were wrong. There were ideas; in fact, there were five ideas—five ideas announced last year in the Labor Party's year of ideas—and every one of them was an idea for a new tax. So if you seek to know the risks, look before you.
