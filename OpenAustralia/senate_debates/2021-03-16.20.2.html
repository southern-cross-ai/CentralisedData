         I thank Senator Paterson for his question. It is timely, indeed, that His Excellency is in the gallery today for this question. On Saturday I was pleased to join the Prime Minister for the first Quad leaders meeting, which followed the third Quad foreign ministers meeting in February.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quad" rel="nofollow">
          The Quad
         </a>
         brings together four like-minded democracies—Australia, India, Japan and the United States—united by a shared vision for a free, open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific region.
        </p>
        <p>
         The leaders summit was an historic moment that reinforces our support for a sovereign, resilient and stable Indo-Pacific. President Biden and prime ministers Morrison, Modi and Suga have set an ambitious, practical and positive agenda for key regional priorities. As the Prime Minister said at the beginning of the summit, history teaches us that when nations engage together in a partnership of strategic trust, of common hope and shared values, much can be achieved. This supports Australia's strategic interests, reflecting our belief in a region governed by rules not by power.
        </p>
        <p>
         Through the Quad, Australia works with our close partners to support a region based on sovereignty and respect for international law. The Quad complements Australia's engagement in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         -led, ASEAN-centred architecture and other bilateral, regional and multilateral groupings. All four Quad countries are strongly committed to ASEAN centrality, as well as the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and to working with regional partners to ensure a prosperous and secure region. Australia looks to our friends in achieving these goals but we don't leave it to our friends. As our response to COVID-19 demonstrates, Australia will do our share of the lifting.

            tsunami, Quad leaders launched a landmark partnership on Saturday to support our region's recovery from COVID-19. Together we're taking action to expand safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing and delivery in 2021. Reflecting our respective strengths and investments will ramp up vaccine manufacturing capacity, fund the procurement and distribution of vaccines, and provide last-mile delivery support.
           </p>
           <p>
            Building on the government's existing commitment of a $523 million regional vaccine access and health security program, Australia has pledged an additional $100 million to be allocated in consultation between Quad partners. Wherever possible, Quad partners will take opportunities to implement joint or closely coordinated programs of support for our partner countries in the Indo-Pacific, with a particular focus on South-East Asia.

              <p>
               I want to note that Quad leaders in particular underscored that climate change is a global priority and, of course, a risk to Indo-Pacific resilience. We have established a new Quad climate working group to strengthen climate action and advance the low-emissions technology required to achieve net zero emissions as soon as possible. We have also established a critical and emerging technology working group, recognising that a free, open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific requires that critical technology is governed according to shared values.
              </p>
              <p>
               That builds on the Quad's existing agenda agreed by foreign ministers at our own meeting in Tokyo last October. That agenda includes cooperation on maritime security, on infrastructure, on supply chain resilience, on counterterrorism, on cyber and on counter- and disinformation. I particularly look forward to taking forward this important work with my counterparts: Indian external affairs minister, Minister Jaishankar; Japanese foreign minister, Minister Motegi; and
