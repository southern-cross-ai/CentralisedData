        This Order permits flight crew competency checks to be carried out by overseas flight simulator training organisations. According to the Explanatory Statement, it has been the practice of the

         Civil Aviation Safety Authority
        </a>
        to permit one of the two annual competency checks to be carried out by overseas trainers, the second check being carried out in Australia. The stated purpose of this Order is to put this administrative practice onto a more certain legal footing. It is not clear, however, whether it is intended by this Order that both of the annual competency checks may now be carried out by overseas trainers. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on this matter.

        This instrument revokes a previous instrument (CASA 579/05) dealing with the supervision requirements for aircraft polishers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Explanatory Statement to this present instrument states that the revocation is necessary because the scope of the previous instrument has been misinterpreted, leading to possible concerns for aircraft safety. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice about the nature of this misinterpretation and its effect on aircraft safety to assist in its consideration of any future instrument that might be made in substitution for the revoked instrument.
