         Consolidated Revenue Fund

       <p class="italic">
        The Bill provides funding to support the following significant items.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Defence will receive $1.8 billion. This primarily reflects reclassification of $1.3 billion from capital to operating funding reflecting updated expenditure requirements and supplementation of $172.3 million for foreign exchange losses incurred in 2021-22.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Social Services portfolio will receive over $1 billion, with the majority of funding provided for the National Disability Insurance Agency to provide reasonable and necessary supports for National Disability Insurance Scheme participants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations will receive just under $1 billion, primarily to support apprentices and employers through the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Health and Aged Care will receive close to $900 million, including $207 million for vaccines and logistics, $182 million to reimburse aged care providers for direct costs related to managing COVID-19 outbreaks and $166 million for administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will receive over $235 million to meet the surge in demand for passports following the reopening of international borders and for the design and construction of the
