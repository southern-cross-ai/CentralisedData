         I thank Senator Paterson for that question. I also thank him for his enduring support for our nation's security. Malicious cyberactivity is increasing in our nation in its frequency, in its scale and also in its sophistication. In the last financial year alone, the Australian Cyber Security Centre had over 60,000 reported cases of cybercrime. Today, there are over two million small to medium businesses here in Australia and their cyber-resilience is absolutely critical to our post-COVID-19 recovery. That's why, today, I launched a new national cybersecurity campaign for small businesses. This new campaign will empower Australians to take responsibility for their online security. Led by the Australian Cyber Security Centre, it will provide regular, easy-to-follow advice for all Australians on how to protect themselves. The campaign will particularly target the major cybersecurity threats that face Australian businesses. It starts with the first publication on ransomware. This campaign will be as agile as the cybercriminals that we seek to defeat.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has made an unprecedented investment in our nation's cybersecurity. This includes a $1.67 billion announcement by the Prime Minister through the national Cyber Security Strategy. It includes a $15 billion investment in enhanced cyber and information warfare capabilities for the

         and the Australian Signals Directorate. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility for all Australians. I urge all Australians to go to cyber.gov.au for tips on how to act now, how to stay secure and how to protect themselves and their families online.

            I thank the senator for his question. Australians need to be aware that it is not just large businesses that are being targeted by cybercriminals. Small and medium enterprises are also being targeted. Ransomware attacks now pose the highest cybersecurity threat to Australian small businesses. Over the last 12 months the Australian Cyber Security Centre has seen a 50 per cent increase in ransomware attacks. This week the government, through the Australian Cyber Security Centre, has launched two new guides on ransomware. These guides provide very practical and easily implementable advice for Australian businesses. They advise businesses how to protect themselves, how to respond if they are subject to a ransomware attack and also how to recover from these attacks. I urge all Australian businesses to visit cyber.gov.au to download these guides.

               Thank you very much, Senator, for that question. Globally, malicious cyberactors are taking advantage, quite shamelessly and cruelly, of the COVID-19 pandemic. This government has continued to strike back against highly organised and highly sophisticated foreign cybercriminals. We've done this through an offensive operation led by the Australian Signals Directorate.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Australian Signals Directorate has collaborated with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and the

                Australian Federal Police
               </a>
               to use their offensive cybercapabilities to attack cybercriminals' tools and disrupt their business models. These criminals are simply ruthless, and they are attacking and targeting Australians by tricking victims into downloading advanced criminal malware onto their mobile devices. This

                ASD

               led operation has protected hundreds, if not thousands, of Australians from these crimes.
