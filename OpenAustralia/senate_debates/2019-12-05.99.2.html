        I advise that Senator Davey is being added to this motion. I, and also on behalf of Senators McMahon and Davey, move:

       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>

        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) Australian farmers are highly productive, with each farmer producing enough food to feed 600 people, 150 at home and 450 overseas—feeding approximately 50 million people across the world each year,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) Australia's Free Trade Agreements (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
         FTA
        </a>
        ) give our primary producers and exporters preferential access into the growing markets across Asia,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the Federal Government's work to deliver FTA means that Australian farmers are poised to take advantage of the projected growth in Asia,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) there is a high demand for Australia's safe and nutritious agricultural products across our international markets,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) trade has lifted the real income of Australian households by over $8400 a year, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) in 2017-18, the Australian red meat and livestock industry created employment for around 404,800 people, of these, just over 172,400 people were directly employed in the industry—the industry was also responsible for the employment of a further 232,400 people in businesses servicing the red meat and livestock industry, and as this industry exports 60 % of product, six in every ten jobs relies on our ability to trade with the world;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) congratulates the Federal Government on the entry into force of major FTA across north Asia, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) the China FTA which has resulted in beef exports totalling $1.75 billion in 2018-19—a 75% increase from $1 billion in 2017-18; in November 2019 alone, Australia's chilled and frozen beef exports to China reached a new record high of 34,264 tonnes, 134% above November last year; dairy product exports totalling $1.7 billion in 2018-19—a 54% increase from $1.1 billion in 2017-18,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the Japan FTA which has resulted in beef exports totalling $2.3 billion in 2018—a 14% increase from $2 billion in 2017, cheese exports totalled $498 million in 2018—a 17% increase over 2017, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the Korean FTA which has resulted in beef exports totalling $1.37 billion in 2018—a 25% increase from $1.1 billion in 2017;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) notes Indonesia's demand for Australia's quality clean, green produce will continue to be built on the back of demand from its increasingly affluent 260 million strong population—under

        (d) supports the growth of Australian agriculture through the negotiation of preferential market access in export markets of the world.

           We oppose this motion from Senators McDonald, McMahon and Davey, which claims benefits from free trade agreements. All evidence is to the contrary. According to the ABS, median household incomes have fallen $542 over the last 10 years, not risen. It is true that our amazing farmers produce the world's best food and fibre. No-one is doing more for them than
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
            One Nation
           </a>
           . We support expanding trade opportunities for our farmers. We support fair and honest trade agreements. We oppose sacrificing Australian sovereignty to foreign governments and corporations through investor-state dispute settlement provisions that are always part of so-called free trade agreements That's not free trade. We would welcome an open and honest debate about free trade agreements and their real benefits to everyday Australians

              will be opposing this motion as it congratulates the government on the passage of free trade agreements which are not in our national interest, which undermine our sovereignty and which undermine our environmental and labour standards, particularly via their inclusion of
