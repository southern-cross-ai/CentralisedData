        My question is to the Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan, representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women’s Issues. Will the minister update the Senate on the opportunities available to women in Australia and the significant strides made by women since the coalition came to government? Further, is the minister aware of any impending milestones for women in public life?

         I am representing Senator Julie Bishop, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women’s Issues. I thank Senator Troeth for her question and acknowledge her longstanding interest in the status of women in Australia. All women in this parliament have some commitment to the interests and the status of women in Australia. It is just that this government has made very big strides towards making sure that there are significant gains for women in a number of areas of great importance.
        </p>
        <p>
         First of all, in the workplace, in both jobs growth and wages, women have benefited more than men from strong economic growth in recent years. Since 1996, 909,500 new jobs have been created for women—53.3 per cent of the more than 1.7 million new jobs generated under the Howard government. Women’s earnings have increased as a proportion of men’s, from 83.2 per cent in February 1996 to 85 per cent in November 2005. As an important indicator for the future, young women continue to perform very well in education. The apparent retention rate for girls finishing year 12 has risen four per cent from 77 per cent in 1996 to 81 per cent in 2005.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, support for families with children has enabled many women to choose to combine both employment and the care of their children. Making this option available to women who choose it is vital to allowing the advancement of women in the workforce. More than 60 per cent of Australian mothers with children aged less than 15 years are now employed. The number of child-care places has almost doubled in 10 years. As at 1 January 2006, around 600,000 places were available, representing a quite dramatic increase in support for women who choose to enter the workforce. Since coming to office, the government has increased total assistance to families by more than $6 billion a year. The base rate of family assistance has increased from less than $600 per child in January 1996 to $1,770 per child. This is a real increase of more than 100 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2005, 58.6 per cent of aged pensioners were women. We have now indexed the pension to male total average weekly earnings, delivering better real increases than under the old

         arrangement, providing more financial security for women. Women’s superannuation balances have also been increasing from an average of $17,000 in 1994 to $43,000 in 2002.
        </p>
        <p>
         Women have also been prominent in determining the political direction of this government. The Australian government has the largest number of women in cabinet since Federation and the largest number of women heading up government departments. I acknowledge the good work being done by

         , Joanna Hewitt, Lisa Paul, Lynelle Briggs, Jane Halton and, of course, the secretary of my own department,

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked whether there were any impending milestones for women in public life. It is my great pleasure to inform the Senate that this Sunday Senator Vanstone will strike a record mark as the longest serving woman cabinet minister since Federation. Indeed, the three longest serving woman cabinet ministers are all Liberal women—Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, Senator Vanstone and former Senator Jocelyn Newman. All three have achieved their advancement and political longevity solely on merit and without any quotas. Senator Vanstone’s achievement cannot be overstated. She has dealt with some of the most difficult assignments in government and argued the coalition’s case in a uniquely forthright and vigorous manner. I commend her. The government has backed the promotion of women on merit right across a wide range of other government appointments and women from all walks of life have enjoyed increased success and opportunities over the last decade. I certainly look forward to working hard to continue this record.
