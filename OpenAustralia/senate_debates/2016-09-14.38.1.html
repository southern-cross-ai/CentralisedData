        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. On 10 September the Prime Minister listed superannuation reform as an area of achievement during his first year of office. Over the past four months, backbencher after backbencher has campaigned against these reforms, and they are currently being held hostage in the coalition party room. How can the Prime Minister list superannuation reform as an achievement when he cannot even get it through his own party room?

         Well, Senator Gallagher, you seem to claim an acquaintance with what occurs in the coalition party room that is not the reality. That is not the reality. The proposition, Senator Gallagher, that you have put in your question is simply not the reality. This government understands that there is a need to deal with the issue of superannuation reform. We have taken this issue to an election, and at that election we put to the Australian people a series of reforms—many of them, I might say, Senator Gallagher, supported by your side of politics—which was more adventurous and more comprehensive than any reform of that sector that we had during the six years during which your side of politics was in power and your leader, Senator Wong, was, at least for part of that period, Australia's most unsuccessful finance minister. Senator Gallagher, do you want to have a grown-up debate about reform of superannuation, because that is an important part of the tax system, or do you simply want to do what Labor—

          , a point of order on relevance. The question goes to the issue of listing superannuation reform as an achievement, and the question was: how can this be an achievement when it cannot even get through the party room? The minister has not gone near that question.

            But you see, Senator Gallagher, we are on for a debate about public policy, but you never engage. You never engage. Every question that we had from the opposition yesterday—and, it seems, every question that we are going to get from the opposition today—was about playing trivial political games. Unlike our side of politics, which does come to terms with the serious business of economic reform, the serious business of budget repair, the serious business of structural reform to the economy, we cannot get a discussion from the Labor Party, because you do not have an idea.

              Last week the division within the government forced the Treasurer to release draft superannuation legislation that contained only part of the government's plans, and these resulted in a net cost to the budget. What is the government's current superannuation policy?
