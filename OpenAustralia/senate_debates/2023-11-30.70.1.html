        Last week, I was invited to the Marella healing day, held in honour of the survivors of the Marella Mission Farm in Kellyville. It was a deeply moving event, bringing together 19 of the former residents, with family and friends, to reflect on the past and to move forward together. It also celebrated the removal of the street sign which glorified the name of their abuser.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was more than three years ago when I first met Aunty Rita Wright. Like other children at Marella, Rita was stolen by 'the welfare'. She was taken from her home in Brewarrina at the age of two. She and many other
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        children spent their childhood at Marella Mission Farm, suffering physical, emotional and sexual abuse at the hands of Keith Langford Smith. You could expect that, once these terrible truths were known, removing the street sign bearing his name—undeservedly and inappropriately honouring this man—would have been simple. But it simply wasn't so. If it hadn't been for Aunty Rita, her friend Jan Wright, Greens councillor, Dr Mila Kasby, and survivors of the mission, this would be one of those issues that is lost in the system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marella Farm Mission was named in the royal commission as one of the institutions where sexual abuse was proven to have taken place—we know what happened there. But despite the real weight of evidence against Langford Smith, the local council still questioned the need to take action. It was only after a concerted campaign and one-to-one conversations with the residents on the street, led by Aunty Rita, Jan and our local councillor, that there was eventually overwhelming support to change the name of the road, and deep empathy amongst locals for Aunty Rita and her story. It should not have been so hard to change this name.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank Councillor Kasby, Aunty Rita, all the Marella mob and everyone involved in this important community campaign. I especially thank those residents who now live on Nimbus Place for engaging with this story, for hearing the truth and for moving us towards truth-telling, healing and justice.
