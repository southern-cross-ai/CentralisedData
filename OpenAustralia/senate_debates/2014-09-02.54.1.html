        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, representing the Minister for Defence. Will the Attorney-General outline to the Senate the government's commitment to maintaining our national security for a safe and secure Australia?

         Thank you, Senator Back. Australia is working with our international partners to keep Australians safe and to protect and advance our interests at home and abroad. The escalating terror situation in Iraq and Syria poses an increasing threat unlike any this country has experienced in recent times to the security of the strains both here and overseas.

         This week the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence are travelling to Wales to attend the 2014 and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
          NATO
         </a>
         summit on 4 and 5 September. This important meeting will be attended by 60 world leaders, 70 foreign ministers, 70 defence ministers and 28 NATO member countries. The foreign and defence ministers' attendance at this important international summit demonstrates Australia's commitment to our own national security, to the international community's security, and to the continued development and growth of our international partnerships. The summit and the defence minister's meetings will focus on Iraq; Afghanistan, including the post-2014 true commitment; Russia's military aggression towards Ukraine; and NATO's plans to strengthen its relationship with defence partners.

           , Secretary Kerry, Secretary Hagel, Prime Minister Cameron, Secretary Hammond and Secretary Fallon from the United Kingdom; along with the responsible ministers from all the other countries conducting military airlifts in Iraq. In addition to the foreign and defence ministers' attendance at the summit, Minister Johnston has also been invited to attend two other meetings to discuss future partnership arrangements between Australia and NATO.

             As the Senate has previously been advised, around 60 Australians have been fighting with terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, while a further 100 Australians are known to be funding or facilitating those groups. That is why we are updating our national security legislation and committing an extra $630 million over four years to counter-terrorism measures, including more funding of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and strengthening our community engagement programs to prevent young Australians from becoming involved with extremist groups. As emphasised by the Prime Minister, these measures are targeted at terrorists and potential terrorists, not at any specific community or religion, and are designed to deliver a safe and secure Australia.
