        PAYNE () (): In estimates we canvassed infrastructure investment in

        </a>
        . Our government knew the importance of working with local councils at the epicentre of Australia's growth on what their communities need and deserve. The Western Sydney City Deal is a transformative agreement bringing together state and federal government, alongside eight councils, to deliver in the best interests of our region. It would be deeply disappointing if the power of this unity across three levels of government, and what it has delivered for an area of Sydney typically taken for granted by Labor governments, disappeared into this government's vortex of reviews and committees—including the expert panel for Western Sydney infrastructure planning, the independent strategic review of the Infrastructure Investment Program and the National Urban Policy, for starters. Don't throw out something, that has worked and delivered, for base ideology or base politics; that is the definition of stupidity.

        We also know that, under Labor, a significant increase in migration will see 400,000 people arrive in this financial year, literally in the next six months. Experience shows Western Sydney is often the location for those new migrants—and they are welcome. But Labor have no plan—not one they're sharing with Australia, anyway—to manage these two challenges of piling significant new population numbers on high and growing infrastructure needs in Western Sydney. Apparently we should just trust them—not likely! I say be very aware of Labor once again forgetting Western Sydney.

        I want to particularly thank the Mayor of Campbelltown, Dr George Greiss, who visited and met with me yesterday, for his strong commitment to his community and to Western Sydney. Government should take note of mayors like Dr Greiss. They know what their community needs, and they deserve to be listened to—and that is not being demonstrated by this government.
