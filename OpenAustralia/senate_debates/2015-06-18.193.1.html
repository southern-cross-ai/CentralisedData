        I rise tonight to speak about a great Australian, Mr Greg Bartels. Greg was born on 28 June way back in 1926. He enlisted in the

        </a>
        at the age of 17 in 1943. He tried to get in before that, putting his age up, and finally got there at the age of 17. Greg served on

        Wills and Amalgamated Films.    From 1978 to 1981 Greg was the general secretary of the

         New South Wales

       </p>
       <p>
        He had a distinguished career as Commissioner of the Local Government Grants Commission and Convenor of the Law Foundation of New South Wales. Greg was heavily involved in community activities. He enjoyed coaching and refereeing rugby union and was very much involved in the

       </p>
       <p>
        Greg passed away on 7 May—last month. That is a sad passing for his family. In about 1955 Greg married his lovely wife, Jill, who, sadly, passed away about eight years ago. They had four daughters—the eldest,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Chikarovski" rel="nofollow">
         Kerry Chikarovski
        </a>
        , a well-known character in the Australian media and politics. The next was Robyn, a lovely girl, and, sadly, just a few months ago I attended Robyn's funeral. She fell victim to that terrible disease pancreatic cancer. And there is Julianne and the youngest daughter, Michelle. When you meet Michelle you never forget her, for her sapphire-blue eyes. They were a great family, and Greg was a great Australian. He worked hard, studied hard, gave to his community and served his country in defence of our nation. Recently he underwent several operations. The first one had gone pretty well just a few months ago, but that was not the case in the end, and after about three lots of surgery I think Greg just adopted the attitude of, 'Well, it's time to go and meet up with Jill again.' He was a good Australian who was a great husband, a great community man and a good father, and his legacy will live on for many, many years. I pay tribute to you, Greg Bartels, for what you did for our nation.
