        Theme Two – Practicalities of a Seasonal Contract Labour Scheme

        The Australian Government will continue to review temporary and permanent migration arrangements to ensure they reflect the genuine skill needs of Australian industry and do not represent an impost on the Australian economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the case of employer-sponsored migration arrangements, the Australian Government will continue to ensure these arrangements: comply with Australia’s international commitments (including those relating to the movement of natural persons under General Agreement on Trades in Services); do not result in the displacement of Australian nationals; and complement domestic recruitment and training initiatives.

        DEWR will continue to work closely with the NHLIS to monitor harvest labour supply and demand issues to look for solutions to the mobilisation of ‘out of area’ workers to harvest regions.

The NHLIS will be responsible for liaising directly with grower and grower groups to raise their awareness of

        The multi-crewing program is currently in its initial stages with the first division of multi-crewed Armidale-class patrol boats commencing in mid-August 2006.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Statements" rel="nofollow">
         Financial Statements
        </a>
        . The Inventory items include consumable items, items held for allocation to military personnel and/or units (such as rations packs and boots), and minor generic parts (used to repair items). There are approximately 600,000 stock items in this category. In preparing the 2005-06 financial statements, general stores inventory items were valued on a weighted average costs basis. Where the weighted average cost was not available, Defence endeavoured to use ‘best estimates’ to value these items. Best estimates were based on expert review of comparable items in international military catalogues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During 2005-06, Defence carried out significant remediation work to address the issues of uncertain quantities, system limitations within Standard Defence Supply System (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDSS" rel="nofollow">
         SDSS
        </a>
        ) and other business process issues. As a result, some uncertainty exists around the reported balance of general stores inventory as at 30 June 2006.
       </p>

        The use of external valuers will form part of the approach to address legacy general stores inventory pricing issues in developing 2006-07 financial statements.

         Recommendation 6

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that Defence report on the ‘highly technical issues’ that have been presented to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Accounting_Standards_Board" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Accounting Standards Board
        </a>

        <b>
         Government response: Agreed
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of the 2005-06 Financial Statement process, Defence has raised a number of ‘highly technical issues’ with the Australian Accounting Standards Board. These include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The concept of an asset for not-for profit entities – the current framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements, prescribes that an asset is recognised when it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the asset has cost or value that can be measured reliably. The concept of future economic benefit is relevant for ‘profit’ entities and not for ‘not-for-profit’ entities such as the public sector. Defence is seeking the replacement of this concept with a concept of service potential/utility;
        </li>
        <li>
         Inventory valuation – Defence is seeking an interpretation on the valuation of inventory written down to current replacement cost only when (and to the extent that) there has been a decrease in the service potential of inventory since its acquisition;
        </li>
        <li>
         Assessment of assets for impairment – Defence is clarifying whether it is appropriate to adopt the concept of ‘service or utility-generating units’ for determining the level at which assets should be assessed and tested for impairment;
        </li>
        <li>
         Treatment of restoration obligations arising from contamination or damage of assets – Defence is clarifying that when contamination or damage occurs through the use of an asset as part of Defence’s ongoing operating activities, the restoration obligation, if any, is also treated as the cost of those operating activities without being capitalised; and
        </li>
        <li>
         Extension of unlimited useful lives for assets other than land – Defence is clarifying whether unlimited useful lives could be extended to assets other than land, such as military heritage assets, which are irreplaceable and are managed to ensure that they are maintained indefinitely.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Accounting Standards Board has acknowledged that these issues warrant further discussion and also stated that any amendments to standards and authoritative interpretations must go through a formal process and, therefore, may take quite some time.
