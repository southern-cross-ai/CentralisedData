           The National COVID-19 Coordination Commission is an important part of the government's response to this crisis and will help advise the government on actions to anticipate and mitigate the economic and social impacts of the pandemic. Transparency of matters relating to the crisis is important, which is why we supported the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19 and are facilitating agencies and departments to appear before it. That committee is the appropriate mechanism to seek the information requested in this motion, and this is a significant duplication of the committee's work.
