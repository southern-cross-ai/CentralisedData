        , Senator Watt. With $240 million proposed to be spent by your government for the Hobart stadium, you could lift rent assistance for nearly 40,000 Tasmanians by 40 per cent. If those 40,000 people were meeting with you this week, like the stadium lobbyists were, what do you think they'd want you to do?

         Thank you, Senator Tyrrell. Despite the very few questions you have the opportunity to ask, I think you've asked me more questions than the National Party has since the election as well. It's always a pleasure to answer your questions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Tyrrell, obviously the issue around the Hobart Stadium has been a matter of some debate within the Tasmanian community, and, having spent some time in Tasmania, I know that there are very strong views about this on both sides of the debate. Our government is working with the Tasmanian government around this proposal. The Tasmanian government are, I think, on the whole, strongly supportive of it. But we're very conscious that there are a range of views on this topic. What I'd put to you is that, wherever we end up on the issue of the Hobart Stadium, it doesn't mean that we can't also be taking action when it comes to rental affordability and the housing pressures that Tasmanians are undoubtedly under.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can take you through some of what we're doing about rental affordability, but, in the end, the answer to rental stress is a sustained boost to the supply of homes to rent and a substantial investment in new and affordable houses. Senator Tyrrell, you won't be surprised to hear me say then that the best thing the Senate can do is back the Housing Australia Future Fund. I'm actually not across what your position is on that issue, but I certainly know the views of some other Tasmanians who you're sitting right near over there. Hello, Senator Whish-Wilson. It'd be a really good thing if Senator Whish-Wilson, Senator McKim and every other Tasmanian senator joined with the government to back the Housing Australia Future Fund so that we could have that investment in affordable housing, in social housing, in housing for veterans and in housing for domestic violence victims in Tasmania and in every other part of the country. It is odd that we have the Greens and the coalition joining together as the new coalition in Australia to block affordable housing investment.

           The Hobart stadium's own business case says the project will lose $2 for every dollar it makes. When the project itself is telling you it's going to lose all of your money twice over and you think that represents good value, what's your argument against raising the rate of JobSeeker?

            Thanks again, Senator Tyrrell. I probably can't add a huge amount to my previous answer in terms of the Hobart stadium. As I say, it is something that our government is in negotiation with both the

             AFL
            </a>
            and the Tasmanian government on, and I'm sure that in due course our position will be finalised and then determined. But, again, Senator Tyrrell, I do know how we can assist Tasmanians who are doing it tough through the affordable housing crisis, which is undoubtedly the case across the country, including in your state. I know, Senator Tyrrell, that you are a strong supporter of greater investment in social and affordable housing and that's something that we would like to continue working with you on. All I can do is say that the best solution that we have before us is a policy that the government took to the election to create this Housing Australia Future Fund, and we can get going as soon as the Senate passes it to build that housing.

              Budgets are about priorities. You could build 2,900 homes in Tasmania with the funding slated for the government spend on the Hobart stadium. This would be enough to give every single homeless Tasmanian a place to call home. What's your government's priority—putting a roof on a stadium that retracts, by the way, or putting a roof over their heads?

               Thank you, Senator Tyrrell, again. Of course, any budget that the federal government brings down undertakes and provides funding for a broad range of activities, and I'm very confident that when this budget is finalised—and I know Senator Gallagher, in particular, has been putting huge effort into framing it—it will deal with a number of really important challenges that Australians are facing, whether it be in Tasmania or elsewhere around the country. Assisting people with cost-of-living relief will be a real centrepiece of this budget and providing more investment in housing will be as well, provided we can get that legislation passed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Senator Tyrrell, I'm sure you're aware, we are already taking action on affordable housing in Tasmania, with 48 new affordable homes provided in Launceston in partnership with Community Housing Limited and 181 new homes in north-west Tasmania funded by the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, so there's a lot of action. We know there needs to be more, and that's what that housing fund's about.
