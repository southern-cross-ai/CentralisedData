        newspaper about the role of the United States Consul-General, Mr Steve Smith, at an Australian citizenship ceremony in Sydney? Can the minister confirm that the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code says:

       <p class="italic">
        Where the Minister is not able to attend, the Minister will nominate a representative. The Minister’s representative may be a Government member of the House of Representatives, a Government Senator, a senior DIMA officer or another person deemed appropriate by the Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister confirm that, in the absence of the minister and the local MP, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, the formal speaking role was given to

         I did see a story about one of our friends from the United States participating in and making a speech at a citizenship ceremony. Frankly, I thought how nice it was that someone from another country recognised the importance we put on Australian citizenship. With respect to Senator Hurley’s question, I have had a number of other things on my plate this morning, but one of the issues that comes to mind is not so much the role of making a speech—we are entitled to ask people to make a speech; that is neither here nor there—but whether any formal role at that function, as required by the act, was undertaken by that person. I have not had the opportunity to ascertain yet whether a formal role under the act was undertaken by that person, as opposed to that person simply making a speech. But you can be sure that I will be making inquiries about that.

           US

          Consul-General gave a speech at the ceremony titled ‘What it’s like to be an Australian citizen or become an Australian citizen’? Is it appropriate for noncitizens to give formal addresses about what it means to be an Australian citizen at citizenship ceremonies? Does the minister have any plans to change the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code to reflect this?

           I will be frank with you, Senator, and say that I had assumed, without having read every word of the article, that the mayor or someone appropriately qualified in that sense had undertaken the formal role—and I refer you back to my earlier answer in that context. But if you want to put the proposition that at citizenship ceremonies no-one else is entitled to speak and give their views on an issue, and in particular that we should not include anyone from another country, an ambassador, to give such a speech, I think that is not an appropriate policy and it is not one that I would adopt. As you know, with citizenship ceremonies, the formal part—

             Senator, you have had your opportunity to put your question; you have asked for an answer. The mayor is normally the person who undertakes the formal part of the ceremony and there may be guest speakers. I don’t see a problem with that.
