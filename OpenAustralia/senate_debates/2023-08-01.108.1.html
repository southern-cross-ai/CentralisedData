        My question is for the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. The recipients of Australian honours and awards are rightly held in high regard by everyday Australians. In 2019, Kathryn Campbell, the public servant responsible for robodebt and a former senior officer in the ADF, was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia for 'distinguished service to public administration through senior roles with government departments'. An officer of the Order of Australia is awarded for 'distinguished service of a high degree to Australia or to humanity at large'. Thanks to the robodebt royal commission, we now know that Ms Campbell's department received legal advice in 2014 that the robodebt scheme, the one she drove for years, was not lawful. Does the government plan to strip Ms Campbell of her Order of Australia?

         (—) (): Thank you, Senator Lambie. I acknowledge and respect the work that you and other senators in this place have done in relation to robodebt. I think all of us, or certainly most of us, have been appalled by what has been made public by the royal commission and I think appalled by the actions that have been described or alleged in relation to certain ministers. Obviously, the hope always is that the principle of a professional high-quality Public Service is something that we want to see. It's a good thing for the country. I know Senator Gallagher is working with the Public Service to ensure that the sorts of principles that Australians expect from an apolitical professional public service are not only observed but are strengthened.
        </p>
        <p>
         I don't really propose to discuss individuals in particular, particularly in the circumstance where a royal commission report has been presented and a confidential chapter is subject to a direction not to publish that has been made by the royal commission. The advice I have been provided with is that public commentary may prejudice future inquiry or investigation, so you may understand why I won't respond in relation to a specific individual. But I think it has been very clear that the government is intending to act on the—

          In 2012, the now Chief of the Defence Force Angus Campbell was awarded the

           Distinguished Service Cross
          </a>
          for 'distinguished command and leadership in action as commander of

          633'. He received this while commanding Australian diggers who are accused of committing war crimes, diggers he is now throwing under the bus. Does the government plan to strip General Campbell of his Distinguished Service Cross?

           I'd ask you, President, to have a look at whether or not that is a supplementary question, but I will answer it anyway because I think possibly there is a through line which is associated with the award of an Australian honour—although I'd note it's different portfolios.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those decisions are not made by ministers; as you know, there's a process around honours. We have been seeking to improve those and ensure honours reflect the diversity of contributions across the Australian community. My recollection—and I don't have a brief in front of me, and I will come back to you, Senator Lambie, if I'm wrong—is that that is not a matter for government; it would be a matter for His Excellency the Governor-General.

That is why we asked for a royal commission, and that is why the government will methodically go through the recommendations of that royal commission—including that which has not been published. You are right to point to that as a—sorry, am I done?
