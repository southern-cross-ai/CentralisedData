        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. Will the government distance itself from the shameful comments made by Senator Bernardi, who said that the family of young Aylen, who tragically drowned along with his brother and his mother, are not legitimate refugees and that the European crisis is simply opportunistic migration? Does the minister agree that these comments are out of step with community concern and sentiment?

         It has been my sorry experience that, when Senator Hanson-Young asserts that a particular senator has said something, quite often there is the odd word missing and, as a result, the context is completely misrepresented. I am not sure of the exact commentary by Senator Bernardi. I am happy to have a look at it and come back to the chamber in relation to any comments that my good friend Senator Bernardi might have made. We as a government understand that there is a humanitarian crisis that does need to be addressed. That is why, as we speak, Minister Dutton is in Europe engaged in discussions to see what role Australia can play.

         I say to those who would seek to get cheap headlines—people have plucked the figure of 10,000 out of the air. It makes a great headline. But why 10,000 rather than 9,000 or 11,000? There is no rhyme or reason; it was just a nice round figure to get a headline. These matters are best dealt with step by step, methodically, purposefully and, if we can, in lock step with the world community to achieve a result that is compassionate, keeping in mind that true compassion is a blend of kindness and judgement. That is what we need to bring to bear in these debates: sound judgements with kindness. That is what we as a government seek to bring to this issue.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given Senator Abetz's response to that question, I hope the answer to this one is quite simple. It has been reported by the ABC that Liberal Party backbenchers have told the Prime Minister that when it comes to refugees they want 'no more Muslim men'. Will the minister distance the government from the sentiment of these comments?

           Once again we have unnamed sources reported by the ABC. I personally have been the target of those sorts of reports, which are not founded in fact in any way, shape or form. What I would say to the honourable senator is, 'Don't believe everything you might hear on the airways on the ABC.' I can assure the honourable senator and the Australian people that the intake that we have into this country—keeping in mind that it is the most generous in the world—is based on need. That should be the criteria—

              , I ask a further supplementary question. Does the government recognise that these types of divisive comments and attitudes have no place in a modern and caring Australia? Will your government commit to offering help to more refugees on the basis of need and not on the basis purely of religion?

               There is no place in mature Australian politics for the peddling and rehashing of unsourced nonsense. Let's be clear on this. What Senator Hanson-Young is trying to do is cause division in the community by peddling this unsourced nonsense. I have indicated that the intake and the government's concern is to ensure that we look after the people in need. That is, in fact, why we sought and achieved the task of stopping the boats—so that we could have a refugee intake based on need, not on the capacity to pay criminal people smugglers to enhance a particular individual's cause. We have been consistent here, unlike Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens.
