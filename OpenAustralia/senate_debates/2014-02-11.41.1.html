         I thank Senator Eggleston for his question. Given that it is the first question time for the new parliament, I am pleased to advise the Senate that under the Abbott government there has now been a period of 50 days in which there has been no successful people-smuggling venture to Australia by boat.

            could just repeat that for the benefit of the Senate: there has been no successful people-smuggling venture to Australia by boat for 50 days now. One can only ask: when was the last time such a statement was able to be made? Because it clearly was not made under the government or the governments—three of them, in fact—that preceded this one. This government went to the federal election last year with a very clear commitment to the Australian people. The commitment was that, if we were elected to govern, on assuming office we would introduce a strong suite of border protection policies—and that is exactly what this government has done. Despite the protestations of those opposite, despite the efforts of those opposite, despite the former government teaming up yet again with its alliance partner in the Greens to do everything in their power to stop this government from fulfilling its commitment to the Australian people, they have failed to deter us. This government is resolute in its commitment to the Australian people, and that resolution is shown by the policies that we have introduced. The fact is that, despite the actions of those opposite, we continue to stop the boats.

              I thank Senator Eggleston for his supplementary question. The effect of the policies that this government has introduced has been to do exactly what we said we would do at the federal election in 2013, and that was to do what three previous Labor governments had failed to do: stop the boats. In January of this year alone, there have been no boat arrivals in Australia. Compare that to January 2013: 14 boats, 798 people; 2012: five boats, 301 people; January 2011: three boats, 218 people; January 2010: 11 boats, 615 people. The subsequent effect of our policies is that they are working.
