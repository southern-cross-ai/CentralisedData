         We will not oppose that, but I do note with very great concern that not only will the cut-off not apply to this enormous legislation but there will be no Senate committee of inquiry, and I expect that the government will be justifying that process. Given the circumstances, we are not going to oppose the motion, but it does put enormous pressure on the Senate to handle very complicated legislation with an enormous impact on the nation. I want to register the concern that the Greens have that there is no consultation with the public, with business, with the sectors that are particularly involved in this process, and that, we submit, is not good parliamentary procedure. The government has a very serious responsibility here for any untoward effects coming out of this legislation because we are not going through the normal prudent process of a proper Senate inquiry into legislation of this magnitude.

          To introduce measures to protect depositors and policyholders in the event of a failure of a financial institution by making provision for a Financial Claims Scheme applying to general insurers and authorised deposit-taking institutions, and broader crisis management arrangements to enhance the options available and facilitate the management of financial institution failures.
