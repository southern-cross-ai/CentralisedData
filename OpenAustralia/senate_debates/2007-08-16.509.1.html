        There are a couple of questions I would like to ask. But I would also like to make a few comments. I am disappointed with the way the government responded to the Greens amendments. Our amendments are the result of a well thought out, very strongly considered analysis of the bill and what people said during the limited inquiry. Unfortunately, I missed the end of Senator Ian Macdonald’s comments. I did hear him commenting on the Democrats’ contribution. I was called away to the phone and I missed what he said about the Greens amendments.

          Thank you for that interjection. In that case, I am extremely disappointed that the government did not even bother to respond to the Greens amendments in their summing up. As I said, these are the result of a carefully thought out analysis of the bill. Although I could not be at the committee hearing personally because I was in another committee hearing, a member of my staff sat in all day, listened to everybody, read every submission and has read the bill very carefully. We believe these amendments contribute significantly to improving this bill. I would have thought that the government would have given them more attention than to sling off at them, implying that they had already been dealt with when in fact they had not, and would have given them due consideration.
         </p>
         <p>
          Having said that, I would like to ask the government for the clarification that I indicated in my second reading debate speech I would be seeking. As I understood it, during their evidence to the committee inquiry the department gave a rationale about why it would not be advisable to include a requirement in the bill that the plan should be finalised within two years. That rationale was because of the question of what happens if you do not get it done, and that leads to all sorts of complicated legal issues. As I understood it, there was an implication that the government would be clarifying, during the discussion, that the minister would undertake to direct the authority to finalise the first basin plan within two years of establishment. Is the government prepared to make that commitment so that the community can be assured that the intent is for the first basin plan to be completed within two years?

           The minister in the other place committed to the plan being prepared and finalised within two years. If it were in legislation, the whole scheme could potentially fall over because, due to extra consultation, the plan took two years and one day to put together. The government are firmly committed to this. It is interesting to note that sometimes the government are criticised for trying to rush this through—and I am not saying that you are necessarily asserting that, Senator Siewert—and, on other occasions, questions are asked about whether we would use the fact that it had not be legislated to drag our heels. No, we would not. We as a government are very much committed to this. It is our anticipation that everything will be in place within two years. But the view was that, if we were to legislate it and it took two years and one day, it would require further amendments et cetera and that would delay proceedings.

            I thank the minister for that answer. As I said, I understand the arguments that were being put, but we were keen to ensure that the plan was done within two years. As I said earlier, the Greens are concerned about the time delays that are built into this process, so we want to make sure that that is underway. Minister, could you also give us clarification of the time line involved in the IGA? I appreciate that that is not entirely under your purview—there is a negotiation process—but what is the time frame the government would ideally like to work towards?

             As I indicated, a certain plan is being provided to the states and, hopefully, being released this week. I will refer to that in the summing-up. To a large extent, it will depend on the response of the states. Like you, Senator Siewert, we would like to see this go forward as quickly as possible, but, at the end of the day, there is the requirement of cooperation.

              I have some other questions but they will come up during the discussions over the amendments. Our first amendment relates to monitoring an evaluation of the plan. The objects of the bill are actually quite comprehensive with regard to most issues. This deals with the issues around river health. We are concerned about the issues relating to collection and analysis of data. While the previous points make the responsibility of the act quite clear for managing river ecosystem health, it actually leaves out the issue around collection of information needed to undertake this management. Professor
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cullen" rel="nofollow">
               Peter Cullen
              </a>
              pointed this out quite clearly in his evidence to the committee, so we have actually included two amendments.
             </p>
             <p>
              One amendment provides for the regular and systematic collation, analysis and dissemination of information about that. Also, clause 3(h) is amended to include the long-term health, resilience and sustainability of Australia’s rivers, wetlands and estuaries. We want to make it crystal clear, under the objects, that information will be collected. At this stage, the bill says, ‘To provide for the collection, collation’ et cetera—I will not go into all the details—including information about Australia’s water resources and the use and management of water in Australia. That is actually different to the issues around long-term health, resilience and sustainability of Australia’s rivers, wetlands and estuaries.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government probably does intend for that information to be collected, but it is not actually detailed in the objects of the bill.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
               The Greens
              </a>
              think it is much better if that is spelt out very clearly, because Australia’s water resources are different to the long-term health, resilience and sustainability of Australia’s rivers, wetlands and estuaries. We propose these amendments to make it crystal clear in the objects that that is the information that should be collected. I ask the government: why is it not clearly spelt out in the objects that that information should be collected for those issues, when, as I said, it is clear that the objects of the bill also include managing the river’s ecosystem and health?

              <p>
               I indicate that the government will be opposing both amendments. In relation to amendment (1), I draw the honourable senator’s attention to part 7 of the bill which is headed ‘
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water" rel="nofollow">
                Water
               </a>
               information’. It deals with those issues quite comprehensively, I might say, and therefore we do not believe that there is any need for that to be included in the objects as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               In relation to amendment (2), the matters proposed to be added are already included through paragraph 3(h)(i) at page 4, line 3, which provides for the collection of information about Australian water resources generally. ‘Water resource’ is then defined in clause 4 to include all components and ecosystems that contribute to the physical state and environmental value of the water resource. We believe that what Senator Siewert is saying is correct, but it is already all in there and therefore it is not necessary.

                The opposition’s position on these two amendments is the same as our position on all other amendments. We received them this morning. We were not previously consulted about them. There was no consultation before today. We have been critical of the government for the short time that we have had to deal with the bills. To be even handed, we would be critical of the movers for the short time that we have had to consider these amendments—although we do concede that everyone has been under pressure in this week to deal with a very extensive and tight legislative program. We do not believe that it is appropriate to effectively shoot from the hip in relation to this legislation by supporting amendments that we have not had an opportunity to completely investigate, especially in terms of any broad consequences that might arise from amendments that are set out in detail. I understand that Senator Siewert was not able to be at the committee hearing for other reasons. I recognise that Senator Siewert’s staff member was present, as far as I could tell, for most if not all of the committee’s hearing, as was I.
               </p>
               <p>
                It may be that this is a valiant attempt to give expression to noble principles in relation to the legislation. We would be sympathetic in a general sense to a number of the amendments on sheet 5361. However, we do not believe that it is appropriate, as I said, to shoot from the hip and make amendments to the legislation now which we might regret later given more of an opportunity to scrutinise them and a better chance to understand the broad implications that each would have. So we will not be supporting these two amendments; we will not be supporting any of the amendments on sheet 5361, for the reasons that I have outlined. That may not be satisfactory to Senator Siewert, but that is the position that we find ourselves in and that will be the position reflected in our votes on all of the amendments in that package.
               </p>
               <p>
                During the committee, I referred to clause 35 of the legislation in proposed subdivision D and the fact that, where a state or an operating authority or an infrastructure operator established water-sharing arrangements that were not consistent with the basin plan, the legislation appeared to give the Commonwealth the opportunity to effectively bypass those entities and to prosecute an individual holder of a water access right as a means of applying pressure to the other entities mentioned in subclause 1 of clause 35—in other words, the least well-resourced part of the chain might be prosecuted, applying pressure to others above that person or entity in the chain. The officers of the department indicated that they would be prepared to undertake that such a practice would not be observed. I indicated that I would ask that the Commonwealth, through the minister, would give such an undertaking on the record. I repeat the request and ask whether the minister is able to give that undertaking today.

                 I want to respond to the criticism from Senator O’Brien. Senator Siewert has brought in some very compelling and important amendments to this legislation. Senator O’Brien ought to have been introducing amendments. The Labor Party has enormous wherewithal that the Greens do not. The pressure cooker situation here is an outcome of the government putting major legislation without time for proper Senate scrutiny and without time for proper Senate consideration—we all understand that. Notwithstanding that, Senator Siewert and her staff have been able to look at the 233 pages of legislation and at the evidence before the committee and its findings and come up with a suite of very important and sensible amendments. Then Senator O’Brien comes in and says, ‘I haven’t had time to look at them,’ although they were circulated and available yesterday and we sat here until 12 o’clock last night. Most senators were waiting on the deliberations of the

                 legislation, and yet he says he has not had time to look at them and so he is going to vote against them all. The Labor shadow minister has a decision to make here. The legislation—

                   The shadow minister’s shadow has a decision to make here. The legislation was brought in with totally inadequate time for the parliament to deal with it. Senator Siewert has diligently come up with recommendations to make it better. Senator O’Brien says he cannot handle that and he will vote against them, but he has as much responsibility in voting against those amendments and passing up the opportunity as he does in voting with the government for the government legislation. He cannot duck out of it as easily as that. Senator Siewert has done a remarkable job here—quite astounding, considering that she was also handling the

                     The senator opposite is suggesting that she should be leading the opposition benches. I would agree with that. But when you come to a parliament here you have to deal with what comes before you. It is no good saying, ‘I can’t deal with that, so I’m going to vote no on everything.’ That is not a responsible way to deal with the pressures that are put upon us by the government in the way it runs its schedule and the fact that we are sitting here on Friday, so I do not accept that. Labor takes all the responsibility and must accept all the responsibility for simply dismissing these amendments and saying that it will vote against them. The legislative outcome by missing some of these amendments will be its responsibility as much as the government’s if it denies the amendments.

                      . I would also like to point out that nearly all the amendments that the Greens are presenting are a result of submissions, evidence and consultation with community organisations. They are a result of actually listening to people—a result of evidence to the committee that everybody heard at the committee hearing, and everybody has had an opportunity to read the submissions. We had taken the time to consult with organisations, but that is on the basis of what they have been saying in their submissions and the evidence. Peter Cullen said this at the hearing so everybody could hear it:

                     <p class="italic">
                      As to the mission in the document, there are a lot of good requirements for water information, and I strongly support all of that. But there is no requirement for regular information on the health of the rivers, and yet we are doing all of this to restore river health. I believe the bill would be better if we could include in it a commitment to accelerate and to report regularly on the sustainable rivers audit that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission has been doing. We need to get a routine, regular, systematic measure of river health so we can see whether we are getting on with the task.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This is the scientist’s opinion. I agree that there are good information requirements, but they are not specific enough, in the expert’s opinion, to deliver on ecosystem health and on river health. This is a scientist saying this, not just us greenies going off half-cocked. This is the scientists saying that there is not enough provision here to report properly and to require the information collection for river health. That is why we think this amendment should be made, to make it crystal clear that information can be collected and why we are collecting it. We think it is a sensible addition. This bill is about the Murray-Darling system’s river health. Why not be explicit about it? If you think it is there already, make it explicit, because it is not explicit in the bill.

                       First of all, in response to Senator O’Brien, the concern that the honourable senator raised was that a water access right holder who acted in accordance with their right could nonetheless act inconsistently with a basin plan. I understand that to have been his concern, and that has just been confirmed across the chamber. I can indicate to the honourable senator that this is not the purpose of the bill. I would like to assure the chamber that it is not intended to take any action under clause 35 against a water rights holder who acts in good faith and in accordance with the laws of the state and rights granted by the state in which the water is taken.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In relation to Senator Siewert’s comments, I simply indicate that the whole drafting of this bill has been as a result of months and months of consultations, discussions and negotiations. In conclusion, I refer the honourable senator to the meaning of ‘water information’ in clause 125 and then also to clause 130, dealing with national water information standards, including 130(2)(j), ‘any other matter relating to water information that is specified in the regulations’. So if there is deemed to be a need to further enhance these things then that can in the future potentially be done by regulation.

                        These amendments relate to the definition of a long-term sustainable diversion limit. Given the time, I am not going to go over the issues that I have talked about not that long ago in my speech in the second reading debate. These amendments, we believe, help define the long-term sustainable diversion limit better. We are also introducing the concept of a share of water. That is based, again, on evidence that Professor
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Young" rel="nofollow">
                         Mike Young
                        </a>
                        presented. I thought he made a very useful contribution and also a very valuable suggestion. I will just read you the bit from the
                        <i>
                         Hansard
                        </i>
                        . Senator Heffernan had asked him a question about allocations and water use. Professor Young said:
                       </p>
                       <p class="moved">
                        That is very difficult to do quickly. Let me firstly make a very clear distinction between the northern half of the basin and the southern half of the basin. The northern half is best thought of as an event driven system where storages are largely on farms, and that is a very different situation from the southern system, which is a regulated system. In the north, if there is 35 per cent less water, then 35 per cent less would be taken, if the entitlements are defined as shares. I suggest and recommend that the committee consider amending the bill to talk ... more about shares and sharing the system.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        He went on to say that he thought that could be done quite easily. That is what we are attempting to do here: introduce this concept of sharing the water. As I articulated in my speech on the second reading, we are very concerned to ensure that we do have a proper definition of a long-term sustainable diversion limit. These three amendments seek to define that and to put that in place.

                         Briefly, the amendments are opposed. The cap—or, more formally, the long-term average sustainable diversion limit, as defined in the bill—already provides for a variable limit on water use between water years, and this can potentially be expressed as a share under clause 23(2)(c) where the Murray-Darling Basin Authority determines that this is appropriate. As a matter of practicality and enforcement, all shares must be converted to a quantity, as this is what is monitored.

                          This amendment expands on the purpose of the basin plan to include a requirement to consider downstream consequences and to ensure that water flows through the entire system. What we are trying to do is put in place an amendment that is to do with the maintenance of the entire ecosystem to ensure that the functions are ensuring that minimum flows of water regularly pass through the basin’s river system. We are trying to ensure that the whole of the system is looked after through this amendment.

                          This amendment is the result of recommendations from scientists who believe that the current bill does not necessarily ensure that the whole system is looked after. They very strongly recommended that we put in place end-of-basin flow targets so that we can ensure that we get water down through the length of the river and we look after the whole of the river. As I said, it was

                           The amendment is opposed. Clause 20 already provides for basin-wide environmental objectives for water dependent ecosystems to be set. Further to that, clauses 28(2) and 28(3) provide for the specification of targets to be set as part of the environmental watering plan, including flow targets. Setting targets of this nature should be on the basis of best available science and that is precisely what the independent expert Murray-Darling Basin Authority will be charged with doing, on the basis of the merits of the case for the use of the water available.

                            At the moment the bills are being consistent with, for example, Ramsar, the migratory bird conventions and the biodiversity convention. What we seek to do with these amendments is to ensure that the plans and the strategies that are developed to implement these are given effect under this legislation. It is quite an extensive amendment, which talks about how those plans should be implemented through amendments and to give effect to those under the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">

                            . The Environmental Defenders Office, which made a submission to the inquiry, also talked about this quite substantially. In its submission it talked about how to improve the integration with the EPBC Act. It said:

                            What we are seeking to do here is to ensure that these international conventions are implemented, and that they are implemented through the plans and strategies—the ‘doing’ side of things. That is what we are trying to do here: ensure that the government is implementing the conventions through their strategies and plans. I know that the department is undertaking a review of Ramsar site management—I am hoping it is around Australia—because we know that the states are not implementing the plans. That comes back to the Commonwealth, because the Commonwealth is the signatory to these international conventions. These amendments seek to give effect to those plans and strategies so that we are actually doing what we say we are doing. This takes it one step further than just not being consistent with the conventions but in effect is implementing these conventions.

                             Greens amendments (5) and (12) are opposed. In relation to amendment (5), we say that the provisions of clause 21(1) already provide the appropriate reflection of these treaties, and it would be inappropriate for the basin plan to be required to implement the requirements of domestic instruments such as those made under the

                             Act. The instruments made under the

                             should be implemented under that act. We believe that that would be the most appropriate course of action. In relation to Greens amendment (12), the basin plan will provide for requirements that water resource plans must meet. As the basin plan must give effect to relevant international agreements, the requirements will need to reflect the obligations under those agreements.

                                    , is require the basin plan to abide by international agreements—that includes the Ramsar agreement, to which we are signatories, as prescribed in section 335 of the

I might add here that, even though a promise was made back at the turn of the century by the minister for the environment at the time, Mr Kemp, that there would be a migratory bird agreement struck with

                                    This amendment is very critical. It says that we should abide by the nation’s one major environmental law, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, that we should take it into account in drawing up the Basin Plan. There can be no worry with the government if it intends to do that. But this government’s performance is not one of abiding by the

                                    Act. It is not one of implementing its intent or even the letter of its outcome. Just this week a motion before the Senate calling for the environmental laws to be upheld with regard to protecting the habitat of rare and endangered species in this country was voted against by both the major parties, extraordinarily enough.

                                    This is a crucial amendment and the Greens are very strong that the strictures of environmental law in this country be applied to the Murray-Darling Basin. That is what it is about. The practice so far is to ignore the environment and put it last. We are saying here: simply abide by the relevant international agreements we have signed and this nation’s single major environmental law. Surely the government—or the opposition, for that matter—cannot cavil with that.

                                     Senator Bob Brown made some quite complimentary comments about Senator Siewert’s contributions, and I think they are appropriate for the work that she has done. But the submission we have just heard from Senator Bob Brown would indicate that he has not done that degree of work. I refer him to page 15 of the bill, just in case he did not get that far.

                                      Specifically, this amendment implements important and relevant elements of the climate change convention, which I referred to in my speech in the second reading debate. We believe that this is particularly important. Through this amendment, consistency with the Ramsar and biodiversity and various migratory bird conventions is maintained. We think it is also important that consistency be maintained with the climate change convention—because, as we know, climate change will have a pretty devastating impact into the future. In fact, we contend that it is impacting already on the Murray-Darling Basin. Therefore, we believe it is important that we maintain consistency with that convention. In addition, the environmental defenders organisation, in its submission to the committee, said that it felt it was important that we give effect to the climate change convention.

                                      As we are aware, some people still believe that climate change is not impacting on the Murray-Darling Basin—but we believe it is. In fact, Bryson Bates of

                                      has said that he believes climate change fingerprints are all over the Murray-Darling Basin’s decreased rainfall. In addition, many of those who made submissions and presented at last week’s hearing pointed out that they feel it is very important that we build resilience into the Murray-Darling system and that implementing the climate change convention would help answer the need for and give effect to the ability to build resilience into this plan. Did the government consider including the climate change convention into the bill; if not, why not?

                                        Yes, I am aware of that. Perhaps I should have indicated that in my comments. It gives more effect to the bill, compared with the other conventions it gives effect to. We are trying to give effect to the recommendations of the

                                         The plan will deal with all of these matters. We are of the view that the climate change convention, along with all the other conventions and other matters listed in the bill, should be considered to ensure that the plan ultimately has the impact, and effects the purposes, for which it was established. I am not sure of exactly how that could be further enhanced, given that it is specifically referred to.

                                          There are specific clauses—clauses 21(2) and 21(3)—that give effect to the biodiversity and Ramsar conventions but do not go as far as the climate change convention.

                                            Believe me, at this time in the afternoon I am really trying hard not to be pedantic. Clauses 21(2) and (3) specifically take out articles from the Ramsar convention, and then the other one takes out clauses from the biodiversity convention. I am interpreting you as saying that, because there is reference to climate change and broad reference to international conventions, the climate change convention will be given effect through those clauses, even though it is not specifically referenced in one of the clauses. The advisers are nodding their heads. Is that correct?

                                              I thank the minister. As you would appreciate, the Greens feel strongly about this convention; it is very important. If the minister can assure us that, even though the conventions are not named, they will be included and taken into account through that non-limiting clause then the substance of what we seek to include would be dealt with. I am chasing this up so that we can be assured that these issues will be included in any subsequent planning, despite the fact that that convention is not specifically named. So that answer does reassure me somewhat.

                                                Again, I am not going to drag the chamber through the arguments about the independence of the authority, which I mentioned in my contribution to the second reading debate on the bill. These amendments specifically relate to the independence of the authority. They address concerns about the level of ministerial intervention in the operations of the authority, which is intended to be, as we understand it, an independent decision-making body, operating on the basis of the best available science. We believe the amendments address ongoing concerns about the potential politicisation of the basin planning process.

                                               <p>
                                                In moving these amendments, I would like to clarify some of the issues that I raised in the briefing we had. When the minister reports back to parliament, I want to clarify the issue of where they are following or diverging from the advice of the authority. During the discussions around the development of this legislation, public statements were made on when the minister would be reporting to parliament. From what I have been told and from reading certain documents, I understand that, where the minister diverges from advice given on policy and where the minister directs on the basin plan, that advice will be tabled in parliament but that where that advice is about finances it will not be. Is that a correct understanding?

                                                 Act, but I assume that the honourable senator is seeking information not about that but more about the science and things of that nature. I do have some information for her. The government believes the bill strikes the right balance between the independence of the authority and government accountability to the electorate. The minister’s capacity to give directions to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has been appropriately limited to reflect the independent and expert based nature of the authority, while ensuring that the democratically elected government has an appropriate role, if required, in important decisions such as those involving trade-offs between economic, environmental and social objectives. However, the minister cannot give directions on any matters of a scientific or factual nature. This means, for example, that the minister could not direct the authority to change its assessment of the water needs of particular ecosystems within the basin. However, the minister may direct the authority on priorities in circumstances where trade-offs need to be made. In all cases where the minister gives direction to the authority, which it is anticipated will be rare, the minister must table the reasons for such directions in parliament.

                                                 In the case of directions relating to the basin plan, the minister must include reasons for not following the advice of the authority. I think the senator was also asking within what time frame that work had to be tabled. I am advised that that information would be tabled at the same time as the plan is tabled. The minister is also prevented from giving any directions to the authority in respect of any enforcement related action the authority decides to take. If there are any other matters in this bracket of amendments, I am happy to try to answer them.

                                                         These amendments relate to the issues around compulsory acquisition and just terms acquisition. I do understand why the government moved to rule out the issues around compulsory acquisition. As I understand it, they largely relate to the politics of the basin. Some people believe that there should not be any compulsory acquisition. Some pretty compelling arguments were put forward by way of submissions and in evidence to the hearings about acquisition on just terms, to keep as a last resort compulsory acquisition and use the just terms provisions, which we have just extensively debated in the previous legislation. Has the government considered that? It seems to the Greens, from the evidence that we received—and despite the fact that we have always said that, as a last resort, we will not necessarily rule that out as being one mechanism in the basket of mechanisms that you may want to use—that some pretty compelling advice was given around the use of ‘just terms’ and how that will potentially be beneficial to the farming community. Was that talked about at all and considered? If it was not and you did not proceed with it, can you enlighten us as to why you did not think those were useful provisions?

                                                          Section 255 makes it quite clear that the government, through the act, will not authorise compulsory acquisition of water rights. The reason for that is that, as part and parcel of our consultations over that seven-month period, there was a degree of opposition to that prospect. We also believe that that clause in the bill will provide integrity and security to water rights and will assist in the overall development of the markets in relation to water rights. That is why we came to that conclusion, and it is now in the legislation.

                                                           I do understand why the government has ruled that out. The evidence that the committee received revolved around issues of just terms and the fact that, by excluding it, you are excluding a mechanism that may be useful to farmers. I have taken on board what you said, but I do not necessarily agree with it. But did you look at those issues around just terms compensation and the fact that it may be useful to help farmers exit from what in the future could be difficult circumstances in the basin, if what we fear occurs—that is, there is an overall reduction in the amount of water in the basin? Obviously, there will be a reduction in the cap at some stage, but that may be much more significant in the future than we are anticipating if climate change does have the impact on water resources that some suspect it might. It might be a useful tool for government and the community to actually have. Was that considered?

One thing that I would point her to is the $10 billion National Plan for

Five billion dollars of that is set aside for modernising irrigation in Australia and $3 billion is to address overallocation, which will enable purchasing of entitlements and structural adjustment. We believe that that can and will be done on a voluntary basis and, without delaying the Senate, I suppose it is the same approach we had to Securing Our Fishing Future. We had money made available to buy back licences, albeit on a voluntary rather than a compulsory basis. We believe that that would work in these circumstances and we do not see the need to go down the route of compulsory acquisition.

As we are told, there are a number of larger corporations that hold a significant amount of water that they have bought up through MIS investment. How is the government planning to deal with big entities that hold large amounts of water? If what the people in the water market tell me is true, they have already distorted the water market by buying those large allocations. These big entities or corporations may not now want to go ahead with their MIS investment because the rules have changed. Has the government given consideration to how they are going to deal with that major amount of water that is on the market through the big corporations? I am told that they have got a lot of water that they have bought from farmers and that they may be looking to offload that.

I did articulate the reasons for that in my speech on the second reading in that it was recommended that it was a good way to ensure good water management.
                                                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Young" rel="nofollow">

                                                                </p>

                                                                 What I am envisaging is that there will be a step on from where we are now, and I hope there is. There must be for the sake of Australia. To me that means that we need to have an authority that is enabled to grow, expand and be proactive. That is why I suggest they should be responsible for pursuing the objects of the act and, in stepping forward, starting to build really good entitlement registers that are much more secure and that give everybody confidence, progressively working through the many issues.
                                                                </p>

                                                                 We believe that a register will, in fact, build the basis of a much more secure and robust water market. I think people will be aware that Mike Young has been advocating something of this nature for some time. We think it is an eminently sensible idea and that is why we are moving these amendments to put in place such a basin water register.

I indicate that we understand the intentions in relation to the investment decisions, we can understand what is behind it, but at the end of the day a minister would be required to make those investment decisions on that basis, and of course for transparency and accountability any investment made by the minister would potentially be able to be discussed at Senate estimates. So we believe it would be inappropriate to put restrictions on the investment decisions by the government and the decisions, of course, will be guided by the basin plan.
                                                                 </p>

Registers provide the legal security for people with legal interests, including ownership, in the entitlement. Consultation with the states has clearly demonstrated the need for unique and complete registers. The development of multiple registers would likely lead to uncertainty and, while it would be possible to establish a central single register for the basin, this would require a referral of power and considerable disruption to the current development of secure registers. The Commonwealth and state governments prefer to retain compatible state registers with a common central information system that will provide easy access to the state registers. This is provided for in part 5 of the bill.

It makes that clear so that the acquiring or holding of water does not escape the clause.

I have never seen the word ‘water’ used three times out of four words in the one sentence ever in my acquaintance with the English language. I think that might be a record. I note at the start we are referring here to the basin states and I do hope there is a good outcome from this legislation so that we do not have basin state blues further down the line.

In this context where we are setting up an authority made up of independent experts, specifically to make and enforce the plan, which cannot be directed with respect to enforcement action, it is particularly appropriate that it have the sole enforcement role. This argument is even stronger, given that the basin plan will represent a balancing of competing interests.
                                                                       </p>

Such provisions would run the risk that the basin plan, a central factor in providing certainty over water access entitlements, could be held up in the courts, and we believe that not to be appropriate. Rather, the government has included in the bill a comprehensive framework to ensure that all interested parties may have input to the basin plan and that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the minister must take account of all issues raised during the consultation process.

We think it is particularly important for this piece of legislation in terms of enforcement. I take the minister to issues around a number of areas where environmental provisions are not being enforced. For example, water is being stolen, illegal bunds are being built and illegal drains are being dug et cetera. The Greens believe that the community having the ability to enforce legislation is a positive addition to such legislation and in fact holds government accountable. If the government is not prepared to act, this gives the community the capacity to act. There are instances in the Murray-Darling Basin where—and I have raised this issue in this place—water being provided for the environment is being stolen; it is not making it to the site that is supposed to be watered. That is just one example of why we think such public standing provisions are important. Again, that is a recommendation made by a number of organisations that made submissions to the inquiry, believing that this would strengthen this act. Again I ask the government: is giving the community the ability take these positions a positive in helping to empower communities and get positive environmental outcomes?

I suppose the general approach is that, if somebody is aware of illegal activity, rather than they themselves bringing the court action or seeking to enforce the law they should report it to the relevant authority to undertake the prosecution. In this particular case, we have an independent body that by its very nature will have had to make a number of on-balance decisions. We believe that the enforcement role is best left up to this particular authority in these circumstances.

The most recent example is that community organisations have documented evidence—photos, times et cetera—of water being siphoned off and stolen. That information has been provided to the authorities and no action has been taken. These particular organisations would welcome the opportunity to take action themselves if the relevant authorities were not prepared to do it. In the past that information has been provided to the authorities and no action has been taken. As I said, if it were a perfect world I might agree with you, but the world ain’t perfect.

Going to a different scenario: if various plans agree that environmental flows are to be released into a Ramsar wetland, and that water is stolen and evidence of that is collected by the community, whom do they take it to? Do they take it to the state? Do they take it to the Commonwealth? Do they take it to both?

In the event that there was no satisfaction in relation to that aspect, I understand that if the same information were to be provided to the authority they could launch a prosecution. In fact, there would be two potential avenues to pursue a prosecution in the event of water stealing if this legislation gets through.

The states are not required to tell the Commonwealth when they get a licence to clear; they tell the Commonwealth, as I recall, only when the illegal activity has happened. So, although it was impacting on a Ramsar area, the state did not tell the Commonwealth—it was not required to tell the Commonwealth. When I asked about it at estimates I was told that there was an informal network that provides information, but there was not a compulsion to inform the Commonwealth. Is that going to be corrected? Have provisions been put in place to correct that?

We would like to think that this legislation might make it a little bit closer to being perfect. There will be, hopefully as a result of the IGA and other matters, greater consultation and information sharing, which will hopefully overcome that. But, at the end of the day, it is still largely a state jurisdictional issue.

I ask the minister to give a commitment that he will try to address this under the IGA so that there is actually a clear information-sharing process. That process fell down because there was not an information-sharing process until after the event. I would hope, given that you are now giving greater emphasis to, or are being consistent with, the Ramsar convention et cetera—which is good—that there are even more compelling reasons for you to be able to get that information-sharing process right.

It has a list of the authority’s functions but, indeed, it is very light on the reference to the requirement under the objects of the act and the matters that we have been discussing today to ensure the environmental health of the Murray-Darling Basin. These amendments point more specifically to that. Firstly, it would say, ‘The authority has the following functions,’ and, rather than just going to the functions confirmed for the authority under parts 2, 5 and 10, it would begin with new clause (aa), which says: ‘to pursue the objects of this act as set out in section 3’—and those objects specify, amongst other things, the environmental requirements.
                                                                                    </p>

The insertion of ‘threat to the long-term health’ in the clause will ensure that the authority is looking at not just where the basin is now but where it will be down the line, taking into consideration the overview that it must have of the future. Under subclause (1)(h)—‘to collect, analyse and interpret information about the basin water resources and water dependent ecosystems’—we add ‘with specific attention to river, with land and estuary health’ to make sure that those matters are given the priority they deserve.

It is in an appalling state because it has been deprived of water. At that time, egrets, which had reproduced in their thousands each year, had not reproduced at all for the preceding six years. That was the impact of not just climate change and drought but the diverting by irrigators of the water away from that system without adequate government assurance that the ecosystems got the water which is their lifeblood. These amendments simply point more directly to the need for the ecological considerations to be given the priority that they deserve.

Clause 20 of the legislation sets out the purpose of the plan, which is to provide for the integrated management of the basin water resources in a way that promotes the objects of the act. The government considers that this requirement gives the MDBA responsibility for meeting the objects of the act within the scope of its functions.

The addition of the words ‘long-term health of basin waterways’ is covered by the generality of the clause, which deals with the condition of the water dependent ecosystems. In relation to amendment (24), which seeks to add the words ‘with specific attention to river wetland and estuary health’, there is the potential to assert that that in fact constrains the clause and that emphasis would be given to these particular issues as opposed to the generality of basin water resources and ecosystems. We do not think that there is a need to stress some particular aspects over others. We believe that the totality of basin water resources and ecosystems should be considered.

It changes the word ‘must’ to ‘may’ in the section regarding the composition of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. This amendment would enable more than one member of the authority to be full time. The original plan was to require all the members to be full time in the early phase. But then when the nature of the authority changed there was a decision made to make only one of the members full time and to make the others part time. This change from ‘must’ to ‘may’ will enable more than one member to potentially be full time. The

The role of the authority was somewhat reduced because of the changes that came after Victoria refused to refer its power and therefore there was not necessarily a requirement for everybody to be full time.

What they were saying is that the role of the authority might get bigger in the future. The legislation at the moment restricts the authority by saying that only one member can be full time. This amendment puts in place a provision to enable members to be made full-time members if in the future that is required. Rather than the government of the day having to come back here to make an amendment to change ‘must’ to ‘may’, we can do it now to enable more members to be full-time members if that is required.
