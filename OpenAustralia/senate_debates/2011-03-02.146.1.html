        Before I begin my contribution, I would like to put on record my support of Senator Adams’s very personal and thoughtful contribution here tonight on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        earthquake and to join her in sending my condolences, thoughts and support to the New Zealand people in this extremely difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am here tonight to talk about the importance of Australia’s foreign aid program and our role in fulfilling the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" rel="nofollow">
         Millennium Development Goals
        </a>
        . In the past few weeks, in this parliament and in the public sphere, the debate about Australia’s aid program has gained momentum. The opposition reignited the debate when they proposed to cut Australia’s foreign aid contributions to vital programs such as the education partnership program in Indonesia. The idea of cutting all foreign aid to Africa was mooted and thankfully not continued with. Notwithstanding that, the aid cuts were proposed as an alternative to this government’s proposed flood levy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Announcing aid cuts as the coalition alternative to a one-off flood levy is simply a tactic, I believe, to perpetuate a myth that Australians cannot afford to support our own citizens as well as our less fortunate neighbours. Let it be said: we are capable of and we will continue to uphold our role as an international citizen. The proposed cuts to foreign aid show a fundamental disregard for Australia’s role as an international citizen. To look to aid cuts as a quick fix or budget saving mechanism is completely against our national interest and goes against our commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government is looking to the long-term future. We are committed to meeting the agreed target of increasing our aid contribution to 0.5 per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNI" rel="nofollow">
         GNI
        </a>
        by 2015, with a view that we will go to 0.7 per cent after our budget returns to surplus. We have in the interim, since coming to government, doubled our overseas development assistance budget over the last five years. This is a $4.3 billion investment in global development so that we may all enjoy a better and brighter future. This government aims to double that investment again over the next five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the increase this government has made to the aid program, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the crucial role that Australia can play as a middle power with global interests. The situation in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        , for example—what is happening right now in Egypt and Libya—highlights Australia’s role in international diplomacy and why it is so crucial that we continue to invest in our aid program. Australia is a direct stakeholder in the global repercussions of the democratic movement unfolding in the Middle East. Foreign Minister Rudd has said that our security interests, our national economic interests and our international humanitarian interests, together with our most basic consular interests, will be significantly affected by developments in Egypt.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the changing world stage, it follows that we are moving into an international political climate where we will be increasingly required to play a role that promotes stability in our region and beyond. It is essential that we continue our diplomatic and aid efforts to support and empower developing communities and to promote international peace and prosperity. We are awaiting the outcome of the first independent review of Australia’s aid program since the Simons review in 1996. I look forward to the recommendations the panel will put forward and to how we can enhance our aid efforts to provide effective and sustainable support to communities worldwide. The review will assist us to maximise aid effectiveness to achieve real development outcomes against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDG" rel="nofollow">
         MDG
        </a>
        s. The recommendations will assist us to make the best evidence-based decisions, to better understand local needs and to expand our role in partnership with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        , UN agencies,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        s and international financial institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all recognise that there is more that can be done to eradicate poverty and promote tolerance, justice, human rights, gender equality and sustainable development. We are doing what we can with the resources we have available and we will do better and more into the future. Notwithstanding that, we often focus too much on what more needs to be done and forget to acknowledge some of the achievements we have made. There are some success stories we can share. Over the past 40 years, solid progress has been made in the struggle to eradicate extreme poverty. We can be proud that Australia’s aid contribution has formed a part of: reducing a woman’s chance of dying during or after childbirth by 50 per cent; halving the chance of an adult not being able to read; and increasing the average life expectancy in developing countries by 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have made a huge difference through our aid commitment in the Asia-Pacific region. We are internationally recognised for our leading role in the region, particularly in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        and the Pacific. This contribution is vital, particularly given that two-thirds of the world’s poor—some 800 million people—live in the Asia-Pacific yet they receive less than one-third of global aid. Australia’s aid program also provides assistance to Africa, the Middle East,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America" rel="nofollow">
         Latin America
        </a>
        and the Caribbean. Our aid to Africa has increased significantly in recent years and now represents around five per cent of the aid program. Progress is being made and we will continue our commitment to supporting those struggling in our region and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our foreign aid commitment is something which mobilises huge sections of our community. I receive many items of correspondence from constituents pushing for Australia to increase our aid commitment and to do more to assist developing communities. I have also taken the time to meet with various groups who have lobbied for the expansion of Australia’s development assistance. These groups have shared with me their recommendations for Australia’s aid program as well as other issues to do with population and development. I am pleased that there are so many passionate and dedicated people working in our own community to raise support and awareness to assist our neighbours overseas. There are also many people from my own community I know of who are themselves giving their time to work on the ground in developing communities. I am proud that as Australians we are willing and able to support those in need, both at home and overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        It follows that it is important to dispel some of the recent criticisms of Australia’s aid contribution. On 15 February, in my home state of Tasmania, we had the privilege of Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd coming to Hobart to host a forum on Australia’s foreign aid package. The forum was titled ‘A Fair Go for All: Australia’s Foreign Aid Program’ and was an overwhelming success. The Stanley Burbury Lecture Theatre at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        was packed out as over 400 Tasmanians gathered to hear Minister Rudd. The crowd also came equipped to ask their own questions about Australia’s aid commitments. Attendees at the forum were able to engage in an informed, rational and worthwhile discussion about Australia’s aid package. Questions were answered and people were pleased that they had the opportunity to be heard. Most people also seemed pleased with the responses to the concerns they raised. The positive feedback we have received in relation to the forum has been phenomenal. We also know from the feedback that many attendees left the event with a new appreciation of Australia’s role in development assistance and with confidence in the aid package.
       </p>
       <p>
        The support that exists in the community for expanding our aid commitment is inspiring and I hope that this support only grows stronger. I also hope to personally play a role in contributing to the effectiveness of Australia’s aid program through my membership in the Parliamentary Group on Population Development. I know there are colleagues in this chamber and in the other house from all sides of politics who are involved in the PGPD. For those of you who are not familiar with our group, we focus on building support which empowers women and girls. We hope to promote gender equality and the advancement of women in line with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICPD" rel="nofollow">
         ICPD
        </a>
        Program of Action. Our group emphasises the importance of investing and concentrating our aid efforts to promote sexual and reproductive health, as well as education and economic opportunity for women.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also believe it is vital that we continue to address discrimination and violence against women. As we celebrate the 100th International Women’s Day next week and we reflect on how far women have progressed in the fight for equality, peace and development, we cannot forget we still have a long way to go. We cannot go backwards on our commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and I look forward to continuing our contribution to communities in our region and beyond.
