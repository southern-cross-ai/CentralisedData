        I seek leave to incorporate additional respon­ses to questions from Senator Milne, Senator Cash and Senator Xenophon on Wednesday, 8 February and Tuesday, 7 February.

        Further information in response to questions from Senator Milne taken on notice by Senator Ludwig on Tuesday 7 February 2012
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Did the Minister for Resources and Energy seek advice from the previous Attorney-General on the use of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        to 'assist the energy sector and jurisdictional police to manage the increasing risk of disruptions' by environmental protesters?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm advised that the Minister for Resources and Energy wrote to the previous Attorney-General on 10 Sept 2009 to seek advice on how resources in the Attorney-General's portfolio could be used to manage unlawful protest activity in order to maintain peace and security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The previous Attorney-General wrote back to the Minister for Resources and Energy on 6 November 2009 providing general advice on activities undertaken by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        and

        </a>
        in monitoring issues-based groups, but not committing to specific action on this issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Both of these letters were previously released under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
         FOI
        </a>
        in January. It is not the intention of the Attorney-General to comment on AFP operational matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Is the information of private media monitoring contractors available through the FOI process?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm advised the AFP would evaluate material under the FOI Act prior to any release of the information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commercial in-confidence information may fall within the FOI exceptions and not be released; however each document would need to be assessed on its merits.

        Further information in response to a question from Senator Cash taken on notice by Senator Ludwig on Wednesday 8 February 2012
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With respect to the second supplementary question "Given that this centre will soon open, can the minister please advise what work and consultation has been undertaken by the government with the local hospital and ambulance service at Northam to 'ensure the department's operations do not affect access to health services for the local community'?" I am advised the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   Primary health services for detainees at the Yongah Hill Immigration Detention Centre at Northam will be provided on site by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's contracted detention health services provider,

        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        •   Where necessary, specialist medical services, such as dentists and psychiatrists, will be brought in as part of the Department's contract with IHMS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further information in response to questions from Senator Xenophon taken on notice by Senator Ludwig on Wednesday 8 February 2012
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With respect to the first supplementary question, "has the department investigated whether this is an appropriate use of such authorities and would the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas_Group" rel="nofollow">

       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        With respect to the second supplementary question, "Since the

         Fair Work Ombudsman
        </a>
        investigation that commenced last year on the issue of foreign crews on Jetstar domestic leg flights, can the minister indicate whether the department has requested any information from the ombudsman and whether it has received any requests from the Qantas Group to issue other types of visas to cover cabin crew operating on these flights?"
