        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Cash. Can the minister update the Senate on how Australia's national security remains under the real threat of foreign interference and espionage?

         I thank Senator Abetz for the question, and I acknowledge his long, long interest in national security matters in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whilst the government have been focused on tackling the threat of COVID-19, we have never ever lost sight of the many challenges to our safety and security that exist in what we know is a rapidly changing security environment. As Australians would be aware, the threat environment constantly evolves. In fact, it may come as a surprise to most Australians to know that the levels of espionage and foreign interference are higher now than during the Cold War. We know that there are foreign agents working with intent to damage our society. They want to undermine our security, and they want to interfere with the work of government and, ultimately, with the work of our country.
        </p>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         's recent annual report, Director-General Mike Burgess said that espionage could well rival terrorism as a threat to our interests and to our safety. Of course, as members of parliament it is incredibly important for us to remind ourselves that we can also be targets for foreign interference and espionage, especially those who aspire to be ministers in any government.
        </p>
        <p>
         As Director-General Mike Burgess said, foreign spies are attempting to obtain classified information about Australia's trade relationships, and defence and intelligence capabilities. They are seeking to develop targeted relationships with current and former politicians, and current and former security clearance holders. We should always be careful of underplaying the danger of being cavalier about the intentions of these types of people, of these characters and actors, should our paths cross with them as we go about our duties. As members of parliament, we must always remain ever vigilant to the threats posed by espionage and foreign interference.

           I thank the Attorney for her answer, albeit a very concerning answer. How is the government responding to the changing nature of foreign interference, and how do nefarious actors now work against our nation's interests?

            We know, from our intelligence and our security agencies, that foreign interference is changing, and unfortunately it is expandingâ€”especially with the ubiquity of digital technology right across the globe. We know, in particular, that some communities are targeted by foreign actors in an attempt to recruit, and even unknowingly push foreign nations' interests in and around Australia. That is why, as a government, we have strengthened Australia's capacity to defend against foreign interference with legislative tools. These key pieces of legislation are helping our intelligence and our law enforcement agencies continue to have the legislative framework and the tools that they need to appropriately deal with and disrupt these actors. We will continue to make any changes necessary to ensure that, as a nation, we can respond to changing threats from foreign actors and protect Australia's interests.

               Our government has invested over $145 million since 2018-19 to bolster our response to foreign interference in Australia. In the 2021-22 budget, we allocated the largest long-term investment in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                ASIO
               </a>
               to address the complex and dynamic national security environment with $1.3 billion over the next decade. We've also passed legislation that will ensure that the foreign minister, on the advice of our security agencies, can veto agreements with foreign countries struck by state and local governments, as well as universities. This legislation will ensure that any deal with a foreign country is in accordance with Australia's national interest. As I've said, we know that foreign actors are now using cybertactics to further interfere with Australia's interests, and that is why we have made a huge investment with the Australian Signals Directorate.
