        It is anticipate that this bill will detail highly controversial measures relating to the ability of the entertainment industry to apply for court orders to force Internet service providers to block overseas file-sharing websites, in order to stop copyright infringement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is anticipated that there will be strongly divergent views from different industry sectors, civil society and consumer groups over this legislation, and so the Senate should inquire into the legislation in detail.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the Government has stated that this legislation is closely linked to a telecommunications industry code currently being considered by industry self-regulatory body the Communications Alliance. The Communications Alliance has published a draft of this code. It is requested that the terms of reference for this bill inquiry include consideration of this industry code, as it is explicitly linked with the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015 and they are planned to work in tandem.
