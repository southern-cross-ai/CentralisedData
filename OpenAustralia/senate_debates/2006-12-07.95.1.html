        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs. It follows up on the question from Senator Ludwig. Did the Prime Minister say at the time that the sending of a powder to the Indonesian embassy was ‘an act of murderous criminality’? And whilst the sending of white powder, I acknowledge, is a serious hoax, surely that part of the statement should have been retracted by you or the Prime Minister. Is it not a fact that if we misrepresent the situation or do not correct the record, it will be a case of crying wolf once too often and next time valid claims will not be believed?

         I am glad Senator Ray does at least acknowledge it is very serious, because it is. That is why we brought in legislation dealing with hoaxes. In this particular case, not only did it result in the shutting down of the Indonesian embassy but in a great deal of personal concern to the staff who were the intended subjects of that article.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a criminal matter. And it is a very serious matter because, whilst that was going on, very important law enforcement resources were being diverted which could have been used elsewhere, and it is lucky that nothing occurred elsewhere which would have necessitated the use of those resources. That is the problem that this sort of activity presents. It is not only the fear and the apprehension it causes to those concerned; it is the diversion of law enforcement resources. It also caused the shutting down of an embassy, and the seriousness with which it was regarded by the Indonesians was reflected in the subsequent investigations that ensued and did result, as I recall, in Indonesian police travelling to Australia to participate in subsequent investigations. That is the extent of the seriousness of it, and I think that anyone who tries to downplay it is totally missing the point.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given the seriousness of this particular event, can the minister inform us whether anyone has been detained, questioned or charged with an offence in relation to this—by your own admission—extremely serious matter?

           I understand that the investigation has been completed and that no charges have been laid at this time. If there is any further information I can give to the Senate, I will.
