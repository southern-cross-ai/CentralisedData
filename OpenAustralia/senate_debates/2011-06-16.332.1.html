         (1) 1051 as at 27 April 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) There are 11 employees who have identified as having a disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Job applicants are encouraged to disclose disability status.

         &amp;C provides flexible recruitment practices to accommodate people with a disability in all phases of the recruitment process and with reasonable adjustment once they are employed. PM&amp;C's Workplace Diversity Program is available on the Department's website. PM&amp;C is a gold member of the Australian Network on Disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) PM&amp;C has a Disability Action Plan registered with the Australian Human Rights and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Opportunity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Equal Opportunity Commission
         </a>
         . This plan, linked with the Department's Workplace Diversity Program, focuses on addressing the needs of people with a disability through the provision of services and the dissemination of information in relation to disability issues. The plan has three key elements:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         These strategies encourage an environment that accepts and adapts to the needs of people with a disability to assist in retaining these employees.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) PM&amp;C provides internship opportunities to people with a disability currently studying at a university level. These internships are through the "Stepping Into…" programs from the Department's gold membership with the Australian Network on Disability. The Department currently employs staff with a disability recruited through Koomarri disability services in conjunction with the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All employees within PM&amp;C have access to three free executive coaching sessions per year with an Executive Coach who is a member of the PM&amp;C Career Advisory Panel (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP" rel="nofollow">
          CAP
         </a>
         ). All Executive Coaches on the CAP are professional and independent and contracted by PM&amp;C to provide employees with advice in relation to all aspects of their career. The panel is available to staff on a self-referral basis.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) Currently PM&amp;C does not have any disability targets in place as there are no obligations for employees to disclose their disability. PM&amp;C applies its diversity principles in alignment with Commonwealth legislation as well as any principles applied by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service Commission

         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         People with a disability are encouraged to apply for PM&amp;C positions and all reasonable efforts are made to adjust the selection process to provide an equal opportunity for all applicants.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) PM&amp;C provides a supportive environment for staff with a disability. Services for staff with a disability include:
