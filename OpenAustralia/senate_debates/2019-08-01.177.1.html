        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cormann. In relation to his responsibilities as environment minister and to the meeting between Minister Taylor and members of the environment department, the Treasurer has said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A meeting was sought by Angus to understand the technical aspects of the listing process …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A briefing was given and no changes have been made to the listing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Was the Treasurer aware of the member for Hume's personal financial interest in the grasslands matter prior to agreeing to the briefing?

         Obviously I can't give an answer in relation to the state of mind of another individual, but what we do know is that Mr Taylor at all times appropriately disclosed his private interests, consistent with the rules as they apply in the House of Representatives.

           Yes. I go to relevance. I have asked specifically whether or not the Treasurer was aware of this. It is a question of fact, and the minister can't dismiss or ignore the direct question about the knowledge of the Treasurer at that time.

            , I think, to be fair, the minister did directly answer that part of the question in his first couple of sentences, and he is entitled to be directly relevant to that or a remainder of the question.

            <p>
             Honestly, this is just a continuation of this attempted smear by Labor. This is against a hardworking local member and hardworking minister. But the truth is that Minister Taylor has declared all of his interests, consistent with the requirements in the House of Representatives and consistent with the way interests are declared by those opposite. He also stood up for his constituents in pursuing a policy issue that had been raised with him by farmers across his electorate—indeed, as documented by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
              National Farmers Federation
             </a>
             in a widely publicised piece of correspondence.
            </p>
            <p>
             It has been very clear, and no amount of smearing attempted by the Labor Party has been able to show, that Minister Taylor in any way raised matters that he shouldn't have raised. Minister Taylor has always made it clear that he did not raise compliance matters, as he shouldn't. The Labor Party, at no point, has been able to show that the minister was wrong in those statements.

               Freedom-of-information documents reveal that, in April 2017, Minister Frydenberg's office requested advice from the environment department on whether the grasslands listing could be varied against advice, without publication and without being open to legal challenge.

                       If I'm incorrect, I will come back to the chamber next time we sit, but a minister can be quizzed on a statement made, even if it is outside their portfolio. It is therefore, in my view, in order, even though it is a minister representing, for that minister to be asked a question about what the minister they're representing has said, even if it is outside their portfolio—with the necessary limitation, obviously, as Senator Cormann said, that they are limited in what they can say about someone else's thoughts.

                              The assertion was made that it was about a statement. Firstly, I will take that at face value. Secondly, the second supplementary did use words that were contained in the first supplementary. On that basis, I do allow a supplementary to follow on in that regard, in referring to a statement earlier.

                               In any event, given that this is something that is squarely in the portfolio responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, I will receive the appropriate advice from the Minister for the Environment and come back to the chamber.
