        It is a pleasure to make my contribution to the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2013. I did work very hard to try and find something I could say that was really quite exciting about this piece of legislation, but, unfortunately, I have to admit my failure in that sense. It does, however, make some important changes to the current legislation. It does clarify some of the measures that were put in place in legislation that was passed through this chamber a couple of years ago, and in that context it is important that those things are clarified. It does bring into line some of the provisions in this legislation with current practices and powers within state legislation that were inadvertently not transferred from the previous state and territory Uniform Trade Measurement legislation. It also clarifies certain offences around, for example, not obliterating an existing verification mark if an instrument is repaired or adjusted in a way which would affect its meteorological performance. With that, Madam Acting Deputy President, and acknowledging my failure to make this piece of legislation exciting for all who are listening, the coalition indicates its support for the bill.
