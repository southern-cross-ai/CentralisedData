        (Circulated by authority of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry)

       <p>
        I remind senators that we have had a statement of reasons for urgency circulated in the chamber. In fact, it was circulated yesterday. The
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/S550" rel="nofollow">
         Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006
        </a>
        relates to, again, the recent Cole commission of inquiry. Of course, we have another bill which is different in form in response to that. This bill deals more with the marketing of wheat. Its urgency relates to the fact that, as a result of the Cole commission of inquiry, the government has considered the way in which wheat is marketed in Australia. There are urgent considerations because a harvest is in the process of taking place across Australia. In fact, I would venture to say that the majority of the wheat has now been harvested.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government considers that urgent interim measures are needed to address current concerns within the wheat industry. This bill will allow for the change to the veto power for an interim period of six months. The interim arrangements are intended to be in place until 30 June 2007, during which time the government intends to consult widely with industry to ensure the best outcome for wheat growers in deciding longer term wheat marketing arrangements. I stress to senators that this is an urgent interim measure. It was not foreseen; it comes as a result of the Cole commission findings. We need to put this interim measure in place to address at least this summer’s harvest of wheat across Australia. We have attempted to give senators as much notice as possible. It is not a complex bill. In fact, I would suggest it is a very short bill compared to others that we have seen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I am proposing that, should this motion succeed, we proceed with this bill after the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 4) Bill 2006. That would give senators some time to consider their position. If necessary, government speakers could begin the second reading debate to allow further time for senators opposite to consider their position. And we could have the remainder of the debate concluded after question time today, which would give senators time to further consider their position. That is the proposal of the government. A draft was circulated yesterday—a slight amendment has been made to that—and the final draft was circulated this morning. As I said, it is a short bill; it is not complex. It deals with a very important and urgent issue of great concern to many of our farmers across Australia.

         I thank the minister for that round-up about the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006. This is one of those occasions when there is genuine urgency for the legislation to be dealt with by the Senate at the end of a sitting year.

         , very unusually, will not be objecting to the exemption from the cut-off order. Senator Siewert has been dealing with this matter for the Greens. We will be ready to proceed with the debate later in the day, so the Greens will not be opposing this motion.

          being declared an urgent bill. Labor does understand that there is a need for certainty in industry and will not be opposing the exemption from the cut-off. In terms of management of the bill, it is being introduced now and we have before us the second reading speech and the

Labor will be in a position later this morning to be able to deal adequately with the bill. We understand the reasons behind it; they emanate from the Cole commission of inquiry. We appreciate both the Greens’ and the government’s position in bringing forward this bill and ensuring that we have been adequately informed about it and the need for urgency.
