                                I thank the senator. Part of the government’s election commitments was to require an additional, one-off further efficiency dividend of two per cent, from all agencies—not just the

                                . In going through a series of savings exercises in the budget, we also made decisions to effectively apply these dividends, as I indicated, to a range of agencies. The CSIRO performs a vital function within the Commonwealth. It is our leading scientific agency within the Commonwealth. We have, of course, ensured that the CSIRO’s appropriation has actually increased.

                                What we see of course is that the balance of the CSIRO’s funding arrangements provides a new opportunity as a result of new budgetary decisions that were also taken in the context of the last budget. For instance, on Labor’s clean-energy election commitment, we have delivered $25 million for CSIRO’s work on clean-coal technologies and CSIRO is likely to have access to additional funding from the Australian Solar Institute.

                                The opposition may well seek to present these issues in a partisan manner, and they may seek to misrepresent the situation, but the priorities given to the flagships—and of course through the science investment process—has ensured that the impact of the efficiency dividends on the flagship program has actually been minimal. Since the launch of the flagship program in April 2003 nearly 100 patents have been lodged, nearly 400 formal agreements with industry and research partners have been put in place and nearly 350 of those agreements are still running.

We will examine the report and we will study it carefully because the efficiency dividend has been developed as an integral part of a devolved financial management framework where agencies are in fact provided with the flexibility and the autonomy to spend the funds appropriately directed to them by parliament.

The minister has clearly indicated to us that he has not had the opportunity to read the committee’s report. The question asked was whether or not he would adopt the committee’s recommendation. If he has not read it, he clearly is not in a position to advise whether or not it is going to be adopted. As a result, he should take the question on notice and sit down and not just prattle on from a brief that bears no relevance to the question that was asked.

Senator Carr is clearly relevant to the question. He has been referring to the report and to the discussions arising from the report. It is absolutely on message and relevant and this should be dismissed along with the rest of the spurious points of order that they have raised in the last two weeks.

                                       appreciates that the scientific and technical agencies that provided submissions to the inquiry are suffering from the impost of the ongoing, and the recently imposed ‘one-off’, efficiency dividend.

                                       So doesn’t this report from the Labor dominated committee prove that this efficiency dividend has significantly damaged the capacity of Australia’s research and development organisations?

I remain absolutely confident that the
