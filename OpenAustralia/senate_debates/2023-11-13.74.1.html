        It is with deep sadness that I inform the Senate of the passing of Dr Bush-Blanasi who died last night. Dr Bush-Blenasi was the second-longest serving Chairman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Land_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Land Council
        </a>
        as he served for four consecutive terms. He was also the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        Australian of the Year this year, and his sudden passing last night has brought great distress to his family and the Northern Land Council's staff and representatives across the Northern Territory. The offices of the Northern Land Council will be closed this week. The mother of Dr Bush-Blanasi's mother was a Yolngu woman from the Blue Mud Bay region, and he was raised by a Mayili man from Wugularr (Beswick) community. He will be forever remembered for leading the Northern Land Council and dedicating his life to serving Aboriginal communities in the

        The Northern Land Council has put out a statement saying its organisation is stronger for his leadership and will benefit from his legacy for years to come. He was also very passionately for the Uluru Statement from the Heart and supported very much the constitutional change to our country. Sadly that did not occur, and I know that he was pivotal in giving advice and guidance to our government in our preparation for the referendum. My heartfelt condolences go to his children, to brothers and sisters, to Julie, to all of those who called him family. From the Borroloola families and all our families, and from the Senate and the Australian parliament, thank you for your service to our country and to
