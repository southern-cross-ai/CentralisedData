        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to the fact that the government's budget in the immigration portfolio for 2012-13 is based on 450 unlawful entrant arrivals per month. I also refer the minister to the fact that in the first five months of this financial year more than 10,000 unlawful entrants have arrived in Australia, more than four times the government's monthly estimates. Given that each new boat costs the Australian taxpayer approximately $12 million, how much more money will the government be required to be appropriate to compensate for the increased arrivals for this financial year?

         I think some parts of that question are probably more appropriately directed to Senator Lundy, because I note that there were a number of policy assertions in that question. I would make this point: if the opposition are concerned about what has occurred in relation to asylum seeker policies and border protection policies, they should reflect on the fact that they stood in the way of changes in this parliament for months and months and months, because they are not interested in resolving the issue. They are only interested in creating a policy—

          , I rise on a point of order. The minister is not being directly relevant to the question asked. The question was specifically in relation to the budget assumptions and whether there would be additional appropriation to deal with the substantial underestimate of refugee arrivals. She has not borne on that question at all. It is entirely within her portfolio. She should be brought to the question.

           , on the point of order, once again Senator Brandis focuses on just one element of the question. Senator Wong was quite correct in highlighting that there were a number of broader policy assertions within the question, but she is seeking to answer the relevant components for her portfolio and should be allowed to continue to do so.

             The question does come consequent upon passage of the appropriation bill, which I think passed the chamber yesterday. I think the senator who asked me the question participated, possibly at length, in that debate and asked similar questions of the representing minister at that time. It is the case that the bills appropriate total funding of the figure that the senator just quoted at me—in which case, one wonders why she needed to ask me the question—of $1.675 billion to implement the Houston report for costs associated with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMA" rel="nofollow">
              IMA
             </a>
             s, and the funding in the appropriations is consistent with the update that was handed down in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think the $668 million can be broken down to a number of components: an increase in the humanitarian program to 20,000 places per annum, the increase in the family stream of the permanent migration program to 194 places per annum, regional capacity building initiatives to support government and international organisations to strengthen the region's capacity to manage migration, capital costs associated with the regional processing centres, and I can continue in the next supplementary—

              , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to her answer on 29 October 2012 regarding the estimated monthly arrivals for the 2012-13 financial year. The minister said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The estimates variation includes the increase in actual arrivals to date, transitioning down to a lower level by the end of 2012-13 and staying there over the forwards.
             </p>
             <p>
              Given that the number of unlawful arrivals continues to increase, what is the government's definition of 'transitioning down for the purpose of the forward estimates'?

               , I do stand by that answer, and I make it very clear that the government anticipates that as we implement the Houston panel recommendations in full we should see these arrival rates drop. The Houston panel recommendations include not only the offshore processing on Nauru and

                  Order! There is no point of order. I believe the minister is answering the question at this stage. The minister has 19 seconds remaining.

                          , I ask a further supplementary question. In July 2002, there were 1,828 arrivals; in August, 1,969 arrivals; in September, 2,355 arrivals; in October, 2,227; and in the first three weeks of November, 1,767 arrivals. Does the government stand-by its estimate of 450 arrivals per month or does it now concede that that estimate is grossly flawed?

                           The government stands by its budget update in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, including in relation to the revised costs associated with the immigration portfolio. I can say that I think it is clear to anybody watching that those opposite are not interested in an outcome on this. They are only interested in political games.
