        [by video link] My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Does Mr Morrison agree with Mr Fletcher when he asserts that decisions made in relation to the commuter car park program were made on the basis of departmental advice?

         , I'm sure that the Prime Minister agrees with the statements made by Minister Fletcher. I'm not aware of the full context or direct quote that the senator's referring to, but I know that the Prime Minister has full confidence in relation to Minister Fletcher, his work and his statements. These projects that we committed to are all about providing additional support and assistance to Australians in terms of going about their daily lives. It's about making sure that infrastructure is there that people want. For example, I think it's important to look at what defines some of these projects. To quote:

         That's why we are committing to upgrading public parking facilities at

         I hear Senator Watt say that it's a marginal seat. Well, that quote was from the member for Grayndler. The member for Grayndler was actually making that quote when he was committing to provide funding for a commuter car park as part of the Labor Party's Commuter Car Park Program. So, those opposite spelt out the arguments as to why these are worthwhile projects; indeed, those opposite spelt out the fact that, under their model, the member for Grayndler and others were happy to wander around the country making commitments for these projects, So, yes, we are committed to deliver projects that are beneficial to people across Australia and our commitment is to get on with the delivery of those projects, as we have been doing, for the benefit of people across Australia.

               I do grant people who ask questions the opportunity to emphasise the point, but I don't think commentary about the context of the question is appropriate to go into. The minister, in my view, was answering the question. I can't instruct him how to answer it and I definitely, as I've said before, can't instruct the content of an answer to the precision of words the opposition would prefer or an asker would prefer. There are opportunities to debate the content of answers after question time. That's not a matter for points of order. Senator Birmingham.

That was the focus of our government: to make sure we were meeting needs within the community. I am sure that's what all do in relation to commuter car park type projects: look at needs within the community. I'm sure—

                   I'm happy to take a submission, but I'd like to finish what I was saying before I take another submission. I can't instruct the minister how to answer a question. If the minister, as I believe he was then doing, was explaining an alternative rationale, I believe that is directly relevant. Senator Wong.

                    , on your ruling, the question did not go to the program that he's now expanding the benefits of; the question went only to whether or not a list had been seen. In my respectful submission, I would ask you to reconsider your ruling given that a discussion of the program itself is directly relevant in accordance with the standing orders, when the only question he was asked, as the man representing the Prime Minister, is whether the list was seen.

                               Because we are not going to stand for the hypocrisy of those opposite. We are not going to indulge their political games and antics. That's why we voted in that regard in the chamber, because the hypocrisy is quite obvious. Take 2 July 2018 when Mr Shorten did a press conference near Gosford station to announce $15 million for commuter car parks. He was joined by the Labor candidate for Robertson and the Labor member for Dobell. I wonder how those projects were selected. Or 28 July when Mr Albanese was at Narangba station in Queensland with the then member for Longman, Susan Lamb, announcing $5 million. Guess what? That was the day before the Longman by-election. I wonder how that project was chosen by those opposite. Or 27 October 2018 when Mr Albanese teamed up with Labor Premier Dan Andrews to announce the Tarneit commuter car park in the lead-up to the 2018 Victorian state election.
