        Yesterday, I was grateful to meet members of the

        Aboriginal Coastal Alliance, who represent the

        . It's concerning to hear the Greens talk on behalf of traditional owners to oppose gas extraction when, today, we have traditional owners right here in our Senate chamber talking to members of this parliament of their desire to see the Santos Barossa Gas Project go ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        The group came to Canberra so they could speak directly to politicians about their support for Santos's Barossa offshore gas project and make them aware that statements opposing it are not shared by all traditional owners. In the words of one member of the alliance:
       </p>

        It is a fact that most remote and regional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        peoples of the

        </a>
        are living in poverty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Barossa Project presents a desperately needed opportunity for us to improve our living standards and to close the gap.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We decided to support the Santos Barossa Project because they are supporting us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our peoples will support Barossa because of the opportunity it presents. We hope that other companies will come and talk to us about their Offshore Activities in the same respectful way that Santos has engaged us, and with the same level of commitment to working in partnership with our peoples.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Because of this poverty and poor living conditions, we are confident that when people hear and see about the benefits that the Barossa Project is proposing, most First Nations peoples from across the Top End will turn to support the Barossa Project.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We ask the Federal government to help build support for the offshore sector â€¦
       </p>
       <p>
        I would encourage every parliamentarian, both here and in the other place, to take the opportunity to meet with this delegation. Thank you for your time and for coming to the Senate.
