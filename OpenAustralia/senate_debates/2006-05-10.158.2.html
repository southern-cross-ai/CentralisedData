        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the document.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the Australia-Indonesia Institute annual report 2004-05 to the Senate. As some honourable senators would be aware, the Australia-Indonesia Institute is an important part of our bilateral relationship. It was the subject of examination and received support during the deliberations of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its inquiry on Indonesia.
        <i>
         Near neighbours—good neighbours: an inquiry into Australia’s relations with Indonesia
        </i>
        was the title of the inquiry report, back in 2004. I commend that report, similarly, to the chamber. I again place on record my strong interest in and fascination with Indonesia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having said that, I think that, as with all good friends and neighbours, it is really important that we have very open, frank and constructive discussions as neighbours and friends. That means that sometimes we have to talk about things that might be a bit difficult or uncomfortable. I suppose it is not news to anybody at the moment that there are some issues between Australia and Indonesia over our relationship. A lot of that centres on the recent debate about human rights in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua" rel="nofollow">
         West Papua
        </a>
        , the asylum seekers who have come to Australia from West Papua and the government’s decision—one that I strongly support—to grant temporary protection visas to those asylum seekers.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is on that note that I wish to make the point that I see as important organisations such as the Australia-Indonesia Institute and other significant education, cultural and trade institutions that ensure that we have positive, strong and growing ties between our countries. In fact, they are imperative to our relationship so that we understand each other well and we maintain good relations. So I was little concerned, as I think my colleague Senator Bartlett, from Queensland, was as well, to discover that the two of us have found ourselves on a list of what the media have coined ‘enemies of Indonesia’ simply because we have been up front about the issues affecting our region and Indonesia in particular.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been to Indonesia a couple of times. I have never quite got to Bali, and at the moment that might be looking a little difficult. I am making an appeal to the Indonesian government here. On the two trips that I have been on, on parliamentary business, I found the country fascinating. I worked with my colleagues towards coming up with a consensus report that sought only to further our relationship. I do not think the idea of listing individual politicians or organisations as somehow being ‘enemies’ or any other term is the best way to progress our relationship; I really don’t. I think I speak for Senator Bartlett as well when I describe us as friends and supporters of what Indonesia is trying to achieve, or certainly what I have seen in relation to furthering democracy. Indonesia has gone to quite extraordinary lengths and has taken great strides in its democratic progress. Observing its elections was one of the most mind-blowing things I have ever seen. They were conducted in a really harmonious, peaceful and impressive way, especially given the logistical issues with which they had to deal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not want my support for human rights, or that of colleagues, whatever party they may belong to, to be misinterpreted. I have written to the Indonesian ambassador and to the foreign affairs minister of that country to outline my position. This is not because I want to kowtow to that government—far from it. I just want to make clear that when countries are responsible for acts in the past or even currently that are bad then they should be cognisant of those acts and acknowledge them and deal with them. That is what we expect of Indonesia, in the same way that I would expect it of our own country. On that note, I want to make clear that the Australia-Indonesia Institute and other bodies that further our relationship in that constructive way are integral to us understanding our countries better in the future. I once again ask the Indonesian government to look closely at the statements that I and my colleagues have made and to understand them in the context in which they were made. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>

        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
