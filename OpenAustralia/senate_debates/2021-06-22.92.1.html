        This climate-denying government, this government that is pro fossil fuels in the time of a climate emergency, this government that's had no policy on climate action for the eight years that it's been in power, must have been the only government, the only group of individuals on this planet, that was surprised last night when

         UNESCO

        declared the

        </a>
        in danger. They must have been the only people surprised.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me tell you about the lengths they have gone to to avoid this in danger listing from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage
        </a>
        Committee on the values of one of the world's great icons, this precious living organism that can be seen from space. Not only am I aware of direct ministerial intervention with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage Committee
        </a>
        over many years—bureaucratic interventions in relation to whether climate change would be included in the deliberations of the committee—but a Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        , gave $444 million for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in order to avoid a World Heritage in danger listing for the reef. They are the lengths this government has gone to to avoid this.
       </p>
       <p>
        The big question is: why? Why is this government so hell-bent on this on a day like today, when everybody can see the reef's in danger? It's lost half its coral cover in the last five years. The magnificent habitat for thousands of marine creatures has crumbled and died. Why does this government not want to admit this? Why is this government lashing out to everyone today, blaming the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Chinese Communist Party
        </a>
        for this? Heaven forbid! Why is this government going to these lengths? It's because it makes them a global embarrassment as a custodian of this internationally recognised and loved ecosystem. This government has failed because, as the World Heritage Committee points out, it has not taken climate action seriously. This government is a global embarrassment and a disgrace, and I'm glad the international community has called them out.
