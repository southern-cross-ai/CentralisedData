         Order! I asked repeatedly last week for interjections to not occur. They came from both sides of the chamber, and I might say they commenced on the opposition side. They should not have been responded to from the government side. I am going to ask for stony silence in the chamber, and I'm going to ask Senator Roberts to repeat his question so that the minister may hear it and address it. Senator Roberts, please recommence your question.

          's climate research team on four presentations to me. That revealed CSIRO has never said carbon dioxide from human activity is a danger. CSIRO admitted today's temperatures are not unprecedented. CSIRO cited papers do not show that the rate of temperature rise is unprecedented. CSIRO has never quantified any specific impact from human carbon dioxide. CSIRO relied on non-validated, erroneous models. CSIRO relied on discredited papers. CSIRO showed little understanding of papers cited. CSIRO admits to no due diligence on reports on data. CSIRO allows politicians to misrepresent CSIRO without correction. Fifteen highly respected international scientists verified our conclusions. What is the basis for the government's climate and energy policies?

           The basis of our commitment is as part of the international community doing our bit to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. That's the basis. We are committed to a sensible climate change policy which appropriately balances environmental protection with economic responsibility. That has always been our position. As a country, not only have we met but we have exceeded or are exceeding the emissions reduction targets agreed to in Kyoto, and we are on track and have a plan to meet our emissions reduction targets agreed to in Paris. We are a good global citizen. There is a global challenge that needs to be addressed. We are doing our bit—sensibly and responsibly and proportionately—to contribute to meeting that challenge.

           </a>
           specifically, the CSIRO is a national treasure. It undertakes essential science and research which improves our lives and helps grow our economy. CSIRO stands behind its researchers and the integrity of the research produced by them. Their demonstrated record of scientific excellence is underpinned by their commitment to full and transparent participation in the scientific peer review process, which results in evidence based science of the highest quality, including making data publicly available. CSIRO is in the top 0.1 per cent of the world for its four core fields of science, and it's in the world's top one per cent for the other 14 fields. They rank in the top three of the world's national science agencies for impact. I note that the CSIRO has provided briefings to Senator Roberts in the past. I also note that Senator Roberts has asked a number of questions which CSIRO has responded to and will, of course, continue to respond to moving forward. I hope that that appropriately addresses Senator Roberts' question.

             advice. Yet CSIRO's climate team admitted to me that CSIRO has never stated that carbon dioxide from human activity is a danger. When asked for the source of that political claim, CSIRO suggested I asked politicians and ministers. On what basis is your government claiming we need to cut the carbon dioxide from farming, industry, transport and driving cars?

              There is a recognised global challenge which we believe needs to be appropriately addressed in a global fashion through an appropriately comprehensive global arrangement. Australia, as a responsible international citizen, is committed to doing its bit. That is precisely what our government are doing. Under our government, emissions are coming down and electricity prices are also coming down. We are keeping the lights on, bringing electricity prices down and helping to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is economically responsible. We are very proud of our record and we remain committed to that as the appropriate way forward.

                climate research team's position ultimately relies on non-validated and erroneous computer models that are not suitable as a basis for policy. In implying, falsely, that they have confidence in the models despite having never assigned a quantitative calculated confidence level, CSIRO has misled you. Will your government hold an independent inquiry into the so-called science that is supposedly the basis of your climate and energy policies?

                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
                  CSIRO

                 . The CSIRO is a world-class organisation. That doesn't mean that every bit of research is immediately right on the mark, but the CSIRO, like any scientific organisation, understands that any research has to be appropriately tested and peer reviewed. They are absolutely committed to the appropriate rigours and transparencies that apply to any scientific organisations of this nature. That is, of course, appropriate. We completely support the important work the CSIRO does and we continue to stand by it.
