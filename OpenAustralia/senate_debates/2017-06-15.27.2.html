           The government acknowledges that the threat of political interference by foreign intelligence services is a problem of the highest order and that it is getting worse. In early May this year, the Prime Minister initiated a comprehensive review of Australia's espionage and foreign interference laws, and the Attorney-General is leading this review. Following the completion of this review, a tranche of legislative reforms will be introduced into the parliament which, as per standard practice, will be immediately referred to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
            Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
           </a>
           for review. The committee will then have the chance to review these important matters in the usual way. A premature referral will only duplicate, if not delay, efforts already underway to review these matters.
