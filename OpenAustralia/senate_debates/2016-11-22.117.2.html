       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the document.

       <p>
        The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, AHPRA, and the National Boards annual report 2015-16, reporting on the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme, is a very important report. In general, strong results and the smooth running of the registration renewal process for all 14 regulated professions have been achieved. Amazingly, the number of online renewals reached a new high of 98 per cent. That is a very, very good figure. A risk assessment tool developed and trialled in Victoria, Tasmania and the

        as part of the notifications process is helping bring in these good results.
       </p>
       <p>
        I make the point that there is a new initiative to release quarterly performance reports to increase transparency and accountability. There has been continued improvement in the experience of complaints, either when making or being the subject of a complaint. This included redrafted communication materials to make letters more conversational and less formal, and web content that is more user-friendly. A national campaign to increase awareness of the scheme was undertaken, including social media channels, news media and major health publications.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of 6,125 practitioners audited across the 14 professions, 93 per cent were found to be in full compliance. That is a pretty good result, 93 per cent of practitioners found to be in full compliance. While it is a decrease of three per cent from 2014-15, less than one per cent of all audited practitioners were formally cautionedâ€”the same as last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some statistics as at 30 June 2015 are that 657,621 health practitioners in 14 professions were registered in Australia. This is an increase of over 20,000 since last year in the number of practitioners registered. There was an increase in all professions, except nursing and midwifery, and in all jurisdictions. It is very concerning that there has been no increase in nursing. I remember some years back we did an inquiry into the number of nurses in Australia; by 2025, I think it is, we are going to be short of nurses to the tune of 109,000. With the ageing population progressing, of course, the percentage of elderly people who need care will increase. It is concerning to me that the numbers of nurses are not growing as quickly as they should, and I hope that improves in the years to come. There were 153,710 students studying to be health practitioners.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was a 19.7 per cent increase in notifications lodged, and 1.5 per cent of all practitioners were subject to notifications. There was an increase of 166 per cent in statutory offence complaints received, which include complaints about unlawful advertising and unlawful use of protected titles. Complaints about advertising accounted for 75 per cent of all offence complaints, and 57 per cent of these complaints related to chiropractic services.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very important report, and I bring it to the attention of the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
