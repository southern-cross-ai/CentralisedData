         I thank Senator Van for his question about our commitment to preventing, addressing and, ultimately, ending domestic violence in Australia against women and their children.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a major issue for all Australians, but, sadly, at this time of year the evidence, through the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research and the Victorian Crime Statistics Agency, shows the number of incidents of domestic violence often and nearly always do spike over the Christmas and new year period. And it's a very important reminder that at this time it is absolutely crucial that people who need the support of our government and of the services that are provided know those services are there, and for us to be able to support them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the fourth action plan against ending violence against women and their children, we have committed an unprecedented amount of money; $340 million has been allocated towards this absolutely crucial and vital service for Australians who are in particularly difficult circumstances. One very important part of this service is actually the 1800RESPECT line. This is the national sexual assault and family and domestic violence counselling service. It's free, and it's available as a counselling service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service provides support for people who are experiencing or are at risk of sexual assault, for their families and for other members who are impacted by an incident of domestic violence. It also supports survivors who have experienced abuse in the past, their family members and family members of other people who've been subjected to domestic violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         During this time when many of us are celebrating with our families and friends, we also need to make sure that the support services are available to victims of domestic violence. We need to supply the services and to support these people in their times of need. We absolutely have to move towards zero tolerance of violence against women.

            Violence against women and their children remains a very serious issue in Australia. As we know, sadly, one in six women experience physical or sexual violence by a current or a former partner. Under the fourth action plan, the Prime Minister committed significant funding towards the prevention and early intervention through a number of initiatives, which are outlined in the national action plan and its implementation plan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of this funding, a package of $82 million will go towards frontline services, $68 million is directed towards prevention strategies and $78 million to provide safe places for people impacted by domestic violence or family violence. We're also investing $35 million in support of prevention measures specifically for Aboriginal and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
             Torres Strait Islander
            </a>
            communities. The scale of this investment means it's the largest support package to address the unacceptably high levels of domestic violence. This is a record amount of funding.

               Last month, the government began another round of its 'Stop It At The Start' campaign, which is a national primary prevention campaign to help reduce the incidence of violence against women and their children. 'Stop It At The Start' encourages us all to take a step back, to look at where the cycle of disrespect towards women actually starts: in childhood, with beliefs and attitudes that boys and girls develop from a very early age. But it also helps adults to reflect on the impact of what they do and what they say, and to talk to young people about respectful relationships and respect for each other. Adults have a tremendous influence over young people and their lives, and we must make sure that we are all providing a very positive role model to ensure that, in the attitudes of children as they grow up, respect becomes a normal part of that attitude. And if we come together as a community, we can ensure that we can make Australia a safer place for all Australians.
