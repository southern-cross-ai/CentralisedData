          I thank Senator Williams for his question. And in response to Senator Wong's interjection 'Is this all you've got' the answer clearly is no, but I think all Australians know that this is a very, very important part of our policies going forward. Because under no circumstances do any of us on this side of the chamber condemn bullying, thuggery and intimidation on worksites in Australia.

            You do not! In relation to Senator Williams's question, interestingly the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">

            have a new campaign. It is called 'Stand Up. Speak Out'. However, this campaign does not apply to those in the union who choose to speak out on their concerns about senior union officials. For example, a Mr Brian Fitzpatrick stood up and spoke out against questionable union dealings with one George Alex. The royal commission found that Mr Fitzpatrick then received a death threat from one Mr Darren Greenfield, which was described as follows:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            You have gone too far this time you—
           </p>
           <p>
            expletive—
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            fat—
           </p>
           <p>
            expletive—
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            You’re dead!! I’m going to kill you!!
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            You understand?! I don’t care how many police you’ve got with you, [I'm coming over there tomorrow and] I am going to kill you!!
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            You’re dead!!
           </p>
           <p>
            The royal commission also found that there was:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            … the failure on the part of senior [CFMEU] officials to undertake any proper and considered investigation into the incident, and the subsequent victimisation of the complainant by those same officials …
           </p>
           <p>
            What is so startling about the example that I just gave is that Mr Greenfield remains an official of the CFMEU, but—guess what?—Mr Fitzpatrick does not.

                official Mr Luke Collier, who was recently jailed for violent assault, has a history of intimidation and harassment in the workplace. The Heydon royal commission found that on 24 July 2014, at the Barangaroo site in Sydney, Mr Collier threatened a building inspector, saying, '[Expletive] dog … you're a [expletive] grub, why are you here? Go away … You're lower than a paedophile, you grub.' On another occasion, Mr Collier pointed to one of the building inspectors and broadcast the inspector's name and mobile telephone number to the crowd and encouraged the workers to call the inspector, later also saying to another inspector, 'You think all I've got is your phone number.'
