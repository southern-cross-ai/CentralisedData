        Today marks the two-year anniversary of Lismore's worst flood on record. Five people unfortunately lost their lives, over 4,000 people lost their homes and numerous businesses in the CBD were wiped out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The incoming Albanese government promised much, but two years later unfortunately recovery is far from progressing. The $800 million Resilient Homes Program, funded by the Commonwealth and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        governments, originally identified 2,000 homes eligible for buyback, retrofitting or raising. Today, we know less than a thousand will have that offer met, with no plan for the other thousand homes located on flood plains. There is no plan for businesses located on the flood plain. There is no plan for the Lismore CBD. Two years on, for those rendered homeless, finding a place to live remains the biggest challenge for these traumatised communities. The $150 million committed by the then coalition government for risk reduction and mitigation has funded projects unlikely to prevent or reduce the impact of future floods. Communities like Lismore pride themselves on their resilience and ability to cope with disasters, but many are frightened that recovery and housing won't come in time for the next flood.
       </p>
       <p>
        To mark the two-year anniversary, Resilient Lismore has organised a gathering by the river for the community to reflect on the challenges it has faced and the journey still to come. I congratulate the Lismore community for its toughness and its patience, and I hope more is done soon.
