        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. I refer to comments by the Assistant Treasurer reported in the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">

        on negotiations between the government and the Greens on the Financial Accountability Regime Bill.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Jones
        </a>
        , the Assistant Treasurer, said, 'There'd been no sign-off on anything'. Yet, last week in the chamber, Senator McKim stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is absolutely no doubt that Minister Jones and I had an agreement, and any claim that there was no agreement is false.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, can you clarify for the Senate: was there an agreement between Minister Jones and Senator McKim? And, if so, why did the Assistant Treasurer renege on this deal?

         I thank Senator Smith for the question. I don't think it's any secret in this place that we work across the chamber negotiating legislation and possible amendments. We work collegiality where we can. That is our preference. We want to get legislation through. We have a government for the first time in—

            There was also a preamble, Senator Smith. I will listen carefully to the minister. If she's not getting to the point of the question, I will draw her to it, but, at the moment, she is being relevant.

             There were discussions, as you know, through the week around a whole range of pieces of legislation, including with the Greens on a number of pieces of legislation. In respect of one element of those, there is more work to be done before we could finalise a position. We have explained that to the Greens. We have explained to the Greens the work that needs to be done from the government's point of view before we can reach agreement on one of those bills. We appreciate the engagement of the Greens in assisting us with our legislation this week and with all colleagues in the chamber—

                   We weren't able to reach a final agreement on that bill. There have been discussions amongst the parties about how best to proceed where there isn't agreement that could be finally reached to progress the bill in this chamber. There had been discussions, and I accept that there is more work to be done. I thank Senator McKim for his engagement. I would also point out this is cleaning up. Again, the legislation we are working on, remember when you voted—how many times?—26 times against a royal commission into the banking and financial sector? This is actually progressing the outcomes of that work.

                     The Assistant Treasurer had a subsequent blunder yesterday when the government moved an amendment to a government bill being managed by the Assistant Treasurer that was identical to an opposition amendment the government had opposed in the House of Representatives. Has the Treasurer or his office met with the Assistant Treasurer to counsel him on parliamentary process, legislative management—

                        On the point of order, wide latitude was granted to the minister in answering the primary question—wide latitude to talk generally about deals and about conduct. This goes, very clearly, to the conduct and capability of the Assistant Treasurer, who seems to be an ongoing embarrassment for the government.

                         Senator Birmingham, I listened carefully to the points that were made, and I am advised that it is not a supplementary question. As Senator Birmingham said, often latitude is given, and latitude can be given on this occasion, but it is up to the minister as to whether she answers the question or not. I'm going to invite Senator Smith to finish asking the question.

                                just say that Minister Jones is an absolutely fine minister, an outstanding person and a good friend of mine. I have known him since I was 25 years old.

                               </p>

                                Yes, just a couple of summers ago, just a couple of turns around the clock! He has hit the ground running, again, cleaning up nine years of wasted time, of work that was left undone and recommendations that weren't followed through. He is putting through a legislative agenda that we are working through, including probably each sitting week in this place. I have no doubt that Minister Jones, in his work with stakeholders and in the work that he will do to finalise a position and to consult further, will include consultations with the Greens and with others to look at how we can get legislation progressed.

                                  He's hit the ground running and fallen over! Given it is clear that the Assistant Treasurer is not capable of managing Treasury legislation, conducting negotiations, managing stakeholders or administering his portfolio, does the Treasurer retain confidence in the abilities of his Assistant-Treasurer?

                                   I missed the first half of that question, but I answered it in the second question: Minister Jones is an outstanding minister and a fine colleague, who works day and night in his portfolio. There are a lot of stakeholders and a lot of different views in this sector. I've had that shadow portfolio and it is not an easy portfolio to manage. There are stakeholders and different points of view, it has a heavy legislative focus and it involves lots of engagements across the financial services sector, from the big banks to the consumer representatives and everything in between. He is doing an outstanding job in delivering on the government's agenda and the reforms that we want to see done.

                                   In the case of the legislation that Senator Smith's original question related to, before he veered off track: there is more work to be done to reach agreement about how to progress that through the Senate, including talking with stakeholders. That was the decision that the government took this week.
