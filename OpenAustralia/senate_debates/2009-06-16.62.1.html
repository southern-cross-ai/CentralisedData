         by leave—I would just like to place on record that, whilst the opposition support the intent of the motion that is moved by the government in relation to Polish democracy, we feel that the government’s motion is too narrow in attributing credit for the nation’s transition to democracy in that it only identified trade unions. As such, Senator Humphries has given notice of another motion which he will place before the chamber shortly and which reflects the opposition’s views on this issue. Senator Humphries did seek to have the government motion amended, but unsuccessfully.
