          'Hear, hear!' from Senator Watt. There are 64 days for Queensland to change, because Labor have been in power for 25 of the last 30 years. In fact, they've been in power for 2,100 days in their latest iteration. So I think it's good that, this week, Deb Frecklington of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
           LNP
          </a>
          released their Economic Recovery Agency 100-day action plan. Labor have been in power for so long and have done nothing. They're like Sir Snooze-a-lot, this government! They like to snooze and they like to nap. They are a government that has done nothing for Queensland except slowly send it backwards.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a Labor government that is using coronavirus as an alibi to cover up its incompetence and its mismanagement of the Queensland economy. For those who are listening at home, before coronavirus came along, Queensland already had the highest level of bankruptcies in the federation, already had the lowest level of business confidence, and already had the highest level of unemployment in the federation. That is because of the economic mismanagement of Senator Watt's mates in

          . We had that wonderful Treasurer Trad, who was very, very good at making sure that things happened close to properties that she had bought. Former Minister Trad is now hiding under a doona in her place, waiting for the Greens to take her seat.

          In the remaining time I have, I'll take you through what the LNP are going to do as part of their plan to get Queensland moving again, through their 100-day action plan. First of all, we're going to deliver the Bradfield scheme—Bradfield 2.0. We going to catch all those metres of rain that fall in the

          and we're going to turn parts of Queensland where there is limited rain but really good soil into food bowls. We're going to set up the Queensland Dam Company. We know you've got to build dams in Queensland, because all this rain gets flushed out to sea and nothing good comes of it. Talking about flushing water out to sea, let's talk about
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Dam" rel="nofollow">
           Paradise Dam
          </a>
          . It's not just that Labor in Queensland is not building dams. The one dam that has been built in the last 20 years is Paradise Dam, and they're actually taking it down. Those of you who are listening won't believe this. In the middle of the drought, they flushed the water out to sea.

          Exactly! Senator Duniam has said, 'What?' In Senator Duniam's home state, they've built 16 dams in the last 20 years, yet the one dam there is in Queensland has got a giant hole in it thanks to Labor's mismanagement. Here's a fun fact: the bloke who was in charge of building Paradise Dam is now the guy who is in charge of building Cross River Rail, so be worried about making sure those Cross River Rail tunnels are properly sealed, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to do an immediate audit of all of the stalled projects in Queensland. There are hundreds of stalled projects because this Labor government is not very good at making decisions. They don't like making decisions. In fact, they're the world experts at not making decisions. They get the gold medal for it. We're going to make sure that all these stalled projects are audited. Then we're going to get them moving again, because we want to fast-track these projects in Queensland. There is so much potential in Queensland and it is being wasted by Labor. We're going to make sure that the approval of the second M1 will be fast-tracked because, at the moment, the M1 is a car park that occasionally moves. That is how bad the traffic congestion is.

          We've got Senator Watt asking, 'Where's your office?' Senator Watt, I'm always around Queensland. I'm everywhere. I'm a senator for Queensland. I'm a permanent Kon-Tiki tour all around Queensland without all the fun—a Kon-Tiki tour without all the naughty bits. We've got Senator Watt here, who is one of those fly-in senators—Senator Seagull! He flies in and then he flies off again. Well done, Senator Watt!
         </p>
         <p>
          We're also going to establish an industry skills council, because we know how important skills are to make sure that there are jobs coming up in the future and that those businesses can employ people to grow the businesses. And guess what? There are going to be no new taxes under an LNP government, and there won't be any increased taxes under an LNP government. We have Sir Taxalot over there, and Lady Taxalot and Lord Taxalot, and all of the taxing Labor MPs. They love taxes. Nine taxes in Queensland have either been increased or brought in, just in the last few years. There are only 64 days to get rid of this tired Queensland Labor government and to get Deb Frecklington as Premier, so we can get Queensland moving again.
