        Earlier today in the other House a motion was passed to mark the 60 years of the state of Israel and Australia’s strong and enduring ties of friendship with Israel.

        did not debate such a motion but I believe the day is too auspicious for it not to be remarked upon in some way in this House. I wish to associate myself and the Nationals with the motion that was formally passed in the other place which reads:

        This afternoon, members and senators attended a reception with the Israeli ambassador,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Rotem" rel="nofollow">
         Yuval Rotem
        </a>
        , and Mrs Miri Rotem to celebrate this anniversary. Australia established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1949. The Australian embassy in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv" rel="nofollow">
         Tel Aviv
        </a>
        and the Israeli embassy in Canberra were both opened in 1949. The relationship has a strong historical dimension, dating back to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        when Australian forces fought in the region, including in modern-day Israel, alongside their allied counterparts against the Ottomans. Australian was the first country to vote in favour of the 1947
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        partition resolution. Australia supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that recognises Israel’s right to exist in peace and also meets the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia and Israel have a healthy commercial relationship with two-way trade worth $828 million. Our major merchandise export to Israel is coal followed by live animal trading, and pearls and gems. Australia’s Jewish community is a vibrant part of the mosaic of the people who call Australia home. We were only a young federation ourselves when we endorsed Israel’s right to exist on the international stage. We were not even 50 years young. So we are both modern democracies; we are both sanctuaries to migrants looking for a better life, a life that repays hard work with freedom and opportunity; we both have to deal with the scarcity of that most vital resource—water—and we both understand that sometimes it is necessary to fight to keep our freedoms.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not surprising then that Israel and Australia are such strong friends and that we admire each other and help each other in times of need. The achievement of 60 years as a nation state is a remarkable one, given the challenges and threats to Israel over that time. It is a great tribute to the steadfastness of her people that we can mark this day today. The struggle continues in a region of the world known sadly as much for conflict as for being the birthplace of the three great religions of Judaism,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_Islam" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">

        salute Israel today. We honour her incredible achievements and express our willingness to continue as a great friend to Israel.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Jewish community in Australia and the friends I have made there, I hope you celebrate this important 60-year milestone with much happiness. You have recognised that the Nationals are an important bulwark against the rise of anti-Semitism in Australia. We have played a key role in opposing outbreaks of right-wing extremism, and long may that continue. Israel and Australia have been forged by strong-minded people who believe in democratic freedoms. It is up to us in this place to act with respect for those hard-won freedoms. It is also a day to think of those who sacrificed their lives so that today would indeed be the celebration that it is.
