        Feral horses are causing enormous damage to the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves National Heritage place—an environment that is equally unique and fragile. Feral horses threaten with extinction imperilled plants, animals and unique ecological communities that are protected under the

        Act), and that are of cultural and spiritual value to First Nations people. Decisive action is needed to avert the extinction of these plants and animals and to ensure they can recover and prosper. This is no small task and will require all parties with management responsibility for the Australian Alps to work together and to act now.

        <i>
         Threatened Species Action Plan 2022-2032,
        </i>
        the Australian Government will provide additional funding to protect and recover threatened alpine species and ecological communities impacted by feral horses.

        This response has been prepared in the context of ongoing consultation and work to reform national environmental law—the

        </a>
        . The Nature Positive Plan (see https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/epbc/publications/nature-positive-plan) outlines the Australian Government's commitment to strengthen and streamline Australia's environmental laws in response to the

The Standards will improve environmental protections and guide decision making, including matters of national environment significance (MNES) such as the Australian Alps National Heritage place, its internationally important wetlands, and nationally threatened species and ecological communities.

        Impact and population assessments of feral horses are best conducted by relevant states and territories to ensure assessments are adapted to local priorities and procedures for feral species control.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A single, national impact and population assessment of feral horses would not be feasible or effective. Instead, we will work strategically with our state and territory counterparts to build our understanding of the impacts to MNES, including the National Heritage place and susceptible threatened species at risk from feral horses, and take action at the appropriate time and scale.

       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Minister for Environment and Water list habitat degradation, competition and disease transmission by feral horses as a Key Threatening Process under the Environment Biodiversity and Conservation Act 1999.

        The Committee recommends that in partnership with the states and territory, the Murray- Darling Basin Authority undertake work to measure, monitor and record the quality of Basin water resources in and flowing from the Australian Alps, with particular reference to the impact of feral horses.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Water quality monitoring in each of the Murray-Darling Basin jurisdictions is carried out by the relevant state or territory. Under existing programs managed by the MDBA, state agencies monitor several water quality parameters at two monitoring stations upstream of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Hume Dam
        </a>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The MDBA does not have the capacity, resources, and remit to undertake water quality monitoring to identify the impacts of feral horses on the quality of water flowing from the Australian Alps. Noting that water quality outcomes directly overlap with and exacerbate impacts to matters of national environmental significance (such as threatened species habitat), the MDBA will consult states and the territory on developing a work program to better understand the impacts of feral horses. Any implementation would be by the states and the territory.

       <p class="italic">
        As provided in Clause 51 of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, taking measures to protect Hume Reservoir's catchment within each state is a responsibility of the respective state. This requirement is focussed on protecting the catchment from excessive erosion.
