        </p>
        <p>
         I do so because what this piece of legislation seeks to do is to remove from Australian legislation the recognition of US military commissions which were put into Australian law in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceeds_of_Crime_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Proceeds of Crime Act
         </a>
         in 2004 by the government and opposition at the time. These US military commissions have subsequently been found to be unconstitutional and therefore illegal by the US
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
          Supreme Court
         </a>
         , yet they still exist in the Australian statutes. So this piece of legislation needs to be addressed and referred to committee.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand that in the discussion by the

         Committee there was an indication that these matters had been dealt with previously, and that is correct, but there has not been an occasion for a Senate committee to look at the issue of whether or not Australian legislation should recognise the US military commissions that have now been found by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
          US Supreme Court
         </a>
         to be illegal and unconstitutional. What the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         are seeking to do in this referral is ensure that Australian legislation does not legitimise a military commissions process in the United States that has been found by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional and therefore illegal. If we do not deal with this issue then Australian law will be the only law in the world that recognises the US military commissions that have been thrown out.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government and the opposition may object to this legislation, but what I am seeking to do on behalf of the Australian Greens is ensure that it can be looked at by a committee. A committee has not looked at this issue since the US military commissions were ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court. I accept the argument that, yes, this issue has been looked at, but it has not been looked at since the US Supreme Court ruled the commissions unconstitutional. That was a fundamental change and a fundamental shift, I would have thought, in whether or not people chose to recognise the military commissions.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          The Australian Greens
         </a>
         have never supported the US military commissions that were proposed as a way to try David Hicks, because we recognise that they are a kangaroo court. They are completely unfair. They are designed and set up to convict people such as Australian citizen David Hicks. We think that the parliament should never have recognised them, and in 2004 we voted against that. That was not a time when the government had the numbers, so they only got the motion up because the opposition supported them. The government and the opposition put into Australian legislation a recognition of these US military commissions that now the opposition claim they oppose. I am sorry; they voted for them in 2004 and that is why they are still in our law.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Greens’ legislation seeks to ensure that that recognition is removed. What I am doing now is ensuring that a Senate committee has an opportunity to look at that. Whether or not people agree or disagree, it is an opportunity for a Senate committee to discuss whether we should have on the statute books in Australia, in Australian law, recognition of a system of US military commissions that has been found to be unconstitutional in the US Supreme Court. They are unconstitutional in the US but they are on the statute books in Australia. Is that the situation we want? It is certainly not the situation the Australian Greens want, and we think the Senate should look at it. All I am moving here is that a Senate committee look at this issue: should we have on our statutes recognition of US military commissions that have been found to be unconstitutional?
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          The Greens
         </a>
         do not think so. We want the opportunity to at least look at that matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clearly, we support the bill. It is a bill that I introduced into the parliament this morning in my name and in the name of the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Bob Brown, because that is our position. But come on: can’t we at least look at it? The government have said, ‘We don’t want to look at this matter. We’ve dealt with it before.’ I am sorry, but that is wrong. We have not dealt with this matter since the US Supreme Court ruled that the US military commissions were unconstitutional. This is the opportunity to do that. Does the Australian parliament want to look at the matter of whether or not Australian law should recognise the US military commissions that were set up some years ago to try David Hicks and were subsequently found by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional? Does the

          Australian Senate
         </a>
         think we should look at the fact that these US military commissions are recognised in Australian law?

         <p>
          On this motion, Senator Nettle, you do have our support. It is a matter of principle that bills can and should be referred from the Senate to committees in the way that you have asked for. The content of the bill is another matter, but in principle we would normally support these references. I think this reference is even more important because of a couple of issues that really do warrant a remark.
         </p>
         <p>
          This marks the fifth anniversary of Mr
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hicks" rel="nofollow">
           David Hicks
          </a>
          ’s custody. Five years is an extraordinarily long time for anyone to serve in custody, particularly when there has been no charge, no trial and no conviction. The Howard government have abdicated the rule of law. The Howard government are opposing this reference. Why? Because they want to hide behind their culpability for their appalling treatment of Mr David Hicks. Whether this bill will help Mr David Hicks, the opposition does not know, but the purpose of the inquiry is a reasonable request for the government to agree to. On a day when the government have referred a ridiculous number of bills to committees, it really is astonishing that they seek to oppose this one.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government have sacrificed one of their own citizens to a military commission process. If you take a look at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
           Supreme Court
          </a>
          ruling that Senator Nettle has looked at, you see that we do actually have a bit of a window here that the government could act upon. There are currently, as I understand it, no charges laid under the new military commissions process. The government have asserted that Mr Hicks cannot be returned to Australia because he cannot be prosecuted here. I think that really does not stand up. That is the point now, given this window. The government would have liked that window to close, but it is still open.
         </p>

          Senior
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
           US
          </a>
          legal officials have made it very clear that they do not require prosecution at home to release detainees from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay" rel="nofollow">
           Guantanamo Bay
          </a>
          . So there are no charges and no requirement by US officials. Therefore, the impediment is this government; it is not the US. This is an issue that the Australian government can resolve. Australian laws are more than adequate now to deal with any security risks that the government might think Mr Hicks poses. If Mr Hicks is assessed to pose a security risk to the community, I would be astonished to think that after the last five years you have not patched up all the holes in our security laws to such an extent that there would not be a gap. I would be keen to know if you think there is a gap in our security laws. Over the last number of years there certainly has not seemed to be one.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am not one for generally suggesting ways or means, but there seem to be sufficient laws available to deal with any assessed security risk that Mr Hicks may pose if released into Australian custody. There are control orders that can monitor a person’s movement, but, as I said, I do not like to suggest these types of solutions. This is a government that can come up with a solution if it puts its mind to it. On that note, the opposition supports the reference of the

This is an important and necessary point in the assessment of whether our laws are in conflict with the reality of the laws as determined by the

The matter at hand is one of the worst examples of egregious conduct I can think of by this government. That you have deserted an Australian citizen, as you have done, is unfortunately going to be a blight on this government for all time, and history will not judge you kindly. You do lots of good works in other areas but unfortunately this stain will mark this government, and some of you need to do something about it. In the meantime the Senate

The government believes that this matter has been canvassed previously by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and that it is a relatively straightforward question. The government believes that the amendments enacted to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceeds_of_Crime_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Proceeds of Crime Act
            </a>
            2002 which were contained in the Anti-terrorism Act 2004 are reasonable amendments. They ensure that persons who have committed an offence or who may in future be subject to a military commission offence can be prevented from profiting from the proceeds derived from their activities. This has been canvassed. The lawyers acting on behalf of Mr Hicks have filed a claim in the

            ’s case. The government believes that the proposed reasons for the referral could seek to address issues that are now before the courts and that it would be inappropriate to progress an inquiry in the terms proposed. For those reasons, the government believes that this matter should not be referred to the committee as proposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I have said at question time and in other places, the government continues to press the United States authorities for the trial of David Hicks. It has done so for a lengthy period of time and will continue to do so. In this particular case, however, the matter has been dealt with by a Senate committee before, and we have the situation of the legal proceedings which I have mentioned. For those reasons, the government will be opposing Senator Nettle’s motion to amend the report—and that is what leave was given for. I think it is a fairly straightforward matter in relation to the reference. The David Hicks matter, of course, is not a simple one; it is a very difficult and complex one, and we have acknowledged that.

             What appalling arrogance there is in what the minister has just said! He does not believe that a committee should be left to determine for itself whether it is able to work while steering clear of any legal matters that might be before the courts of this country. Since when did governments dictate that to committees? Never. That is a very specious argument, but it points to the government’s arrogance in believing that, since it has the numbers in the Senate, it therefore has the right. Senator Nettle has moved an amendment to, quite properly, have a committee look at a piece of legislation that she and I have brought into the chamber to remove a reference to—and an inherent subservience to—American military commissions under legislation in this country, which does not exist under legislation in any other country on the face of the planet. It is an extraordinary situation that it used to be in legislation in the United States but it effectively does not exist anymore, because it has been found that the American military commissions were illegal under the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
              US
             </a>
             Constitution and US law.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only place left in the world which recognises this kangaroo court is Australia, under legislation brought in by the Howard government and supported by the then Beazley opposition. It is on the statute books in this country. The minister says: ‘Well, it was looked at in 2004 and the committee recommended against it. But we overruled that committee and we went ahead, so we shouldn’t have to look at it now. We had that advice and ignored it.’ The minister is saying, ‘We will not put this to a committee, because either it will agree with us in keeping recognition of the American military commissions on the statutes or, if it doesn’t, we’ll ignore it anyway.’ What extraordinary arrogance there is in that.
            </p>
            <p>
             The decency of this situation in democratic terms is simply that this piece of legislation should be looked at by the committee. The world has changed. America has found that the military commissions it has set up are no longer legal.

              President Bush
             </a>
             accepts that; he does not recognise them. Prime Minister Howard does recognise them. Here we have his minister saying that the government does not want to remove that recognition. That is an extraordinary thing of itself. It is tied to the sorry tale of the United States now saying they are not winning the war in Iraq. But our Prime Minister will not go along with that. He is the last leader left standing on the face of the planet who cannot face the reality of the gruesome situation which has unfolded in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq.

            <p>
             Let the proper process take place here and let this matter go to a committee. That is what should happen and that is what the government should be supporting if it thinks its position is tenable.

                       , as I understand it, Senator Chapman’s motion is about a referral to a joint committee, which is a little bit unusual. I think it should be deferred to a later hour of the day so that we can have a look at it. I am sure we will give leave to come back to do it. I will certainly grant leave for it to be dealt with later so that we can take advice on what it is about. A bill would normally be referred to a Senate committee, although it may not actually be so in this case, but I would seek leave for a deferral so that we can deal with it later.

                        This matter will be deferred to a later hour of the day. My advice is that I can now put the question that the report motion as amended be agreed to and that we can deal with the rest of it later. So the question is that the adoption of the report motion as amended be agreed to.

                         The Airports Act sets out a comprehensive regime for the regulation of the leased 22 federal airports. The proposed amendments are a balance of strengthening regulatory powers on airport development decisions and reducing regulatory burden on airports and airport businesses.

                         The Airports Amendment Bill 2006 was developed following a comprehensive review of the Airports Act 1996. The review recommended a number of changes to improve the operation of the regulatory regime in the Act. The bill implements a number of recommendations arising from the June 2000 Senate Committee Inquiry into the Brisbane Airport Master Plan. The bill also seeks to exclude

                          A “stop the clock” provision which allows the Minister to seek additional information and research on airport major development proposals. This will enable the Minister to better deal with any major development proposals where they consider that further information is required to assess the proposal. Currently the Minister can only approve or reject a development proposal within a 90 day period or the project is deemed to be approved;

                          Better access to key planning and development proposals to be provided to the community by airports through requiring proposals to be readily available free of charge on a website.

                         Non aviation development on airport precincts has become very controversial in recent years. Large retail and manufacturing developments have been approved over the objections of state governments, local councils, retailers and local residents. Reference would provide an opportunity for interested and affected parties to make submissions concerning whether issues would be addressed in the proposed bill.
