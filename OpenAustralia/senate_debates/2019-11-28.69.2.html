        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. I refer to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction's use of doctored travel costs in official ministerial correspondence to the Sydney lord mayor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clover_Moore" rel="nofollow">
         Clover Moore
        </a>
        . Minister Taylor himself has admitted to using incorrect figures in official ministerial correspondence, forcing him to 'apologise unreservedly' to the Sydney lord mayor. Does the minister endorse Minister Taylor's use of doctored travel costs from a false document in official ministerial correspondence?

         Firstly, Minister Taylor does not endorse it. He was obviously not aware when he used that document. That is, of course, why he apologised once he did become aware. No-one should ever use doctored documents—of course not.

           Minister Taylor has told the parliament that the document containing incorrect figures 'was drawn directly from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
            City of Sydney
           </a>

            Let me just say again: nobody should ever—and Minister Taylor 100 per cent agrees with this—knowingly use documents that are not accurate. Nobody should knowingly use documents that are fabricated. In relation to the ins and outs of the matters that Senator Keneally just raised, I refer you to the statements made by Minister Taylor.

               Obviously, both the Prime Minister and Minister Taylor have made statements in relation to these matters, and I refer you to those. Furthermore, we now have this letter from the serial letter writer, Mr Dreyfus, which has gone to the

                Before I come to the next question, I'd just like to clarify my point earlier with regard to the term 'abuse of office', reflecting on the standing orders in front of me. It is my view that someone referring to a member in the other place as an 'abuser of office' would be a personal reflection on a member of the other place under standing order 193(3). The phrase 'abuse of office', however, is an action and not a personal reflection, and I think it would be very dependent upon the context in which it is used, like all language in this place. I thought I should clarify that, reflecting upon it at the time.

                  I thank Senator Waters for that question. The reason why Labor and the Greens attack Minister Taylor so mercilessly is that he's such a good minister. He is so effective at bringing down the cost of electricity, he's so effective at bringing emissions down, and the Labor Party and the Greens don't like it. Minister Taylor has introduced the default market offer, the price caps; he's setting up the $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund; he delivered a $370 million investment in hydrogen and announced the National Hydrogen Strategy; he put an end to dodgy discounts and late payment fees; he implemented the Retailer Reliability Obligation; he's been successful in getting the big-stick legislation passed through the parliament; he delivered the Business Energy Advice Program; he advanced our Gas Market Reform Package; he established the Liddell Taskforce; he invested in four hydrogen projects and one bio energy project; he agreed to underwrite the Queensland-

                  around access to strategic petroleum reserves; and there is more. Minister Taylor is a hardworking, highly effective minister. The Labor Party and the Greens don't like him because of how effective he is. They're just pursuing one political smear after the other to try and bring down somebody who is making a fine contribution to our country.

                    The Prime Minister's ministerial standards expect 'the highest possible standards of probity', and yet the Prime Minister has not taken any action against Minister Taylor for any of those recent or previous scandals. Clearly those standards are either too weak or not being enforced. How long until we get a federal anticorruption body which covers federal politicians?

                     That's a very tenuous supplementary. It used the hook of the previous question to ask a substantively different question, so I will call the minister to answer.

                      Firstly I reject the premise of the question. Minister Taylor is a very good minister. Let me tell you: everyone in the parties of government in this chamber should be very concerned about the proposition that a letter from your political opponents to police—in particular, from a serial, unsuccessful letter-writer like Mr Dreyfus—should be the basis for a minister to be stood aside. Everyone on both sides of this chamber who might have the opportunity in the future to serve as a minister should be very concerned about that proposition.

Governance in Australia is actually at one of the highest standards all around the world, so that proposition and smear that Senator Waters puts forward against Australia and governance in Australia is quite disgraceful. Then she talks about political donations. I seem to recall that one of the biggest ever political donations from a corporate donor was given to the Greens—$1.6 million in a single donation to the

                               As Senator Wong, if she can remember back to when she was a minister, would recall, ministers receive briefings from the ministers they represent and their offices in advance of estimates and in advance of question time. Those briefings are common practice, and we're going to go through letter, chapter and verse of every element of those briefings, where it has been very clear and consistent all along in terms of the statement that Mr Taylor gave to the House of Representatives, making clear, as he also issued publicly, that the document was sourced from the

The opposition can continue to ask the same question again and they're going to get the same answer again. That is what happens when you ask the same question: you get the same answer.

But you seem to be happy to continue to spend all of your time desperately going down political witch-hunts, dirt-digging and smearing—undertaking those activities. We will make sure that we spend our time getting on with dealing with electricity prices, dealing with energy security and dealing with creating more job opportunities for Australians. These are the things that matter. That's what we are going to continue to focus on.
