         Amendment
        </a>
        Bill 2021 (the Bill) is to expand the Government's ability to impose targeted financial sanctions and travel bans against the perpetrators of egregious acts of international concern, beyond Australia's primarily country-based autonomous sanctions framework. The Bill will specify categories of conduct pursuant to which new thematic sanctions could be established. Once the Bill has passed, the Government will amend the
        <i>
         Autonomous Sanctions Regulations 2011
        </i>
        to promptly establish new thematic sanctions regimes relating to serious human rights violations or abuses, serious corruption and significant cyber incidents. This reform implements the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affairs" rel="nofollow">

        <i>
         Criminality, corruption and impunity: Should Australia join the Global Magnitsky movement?.
        </i>
        The Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly announced the measures in the Bill on 5 August 2021. As an increasing number of countries use thematic sanctions to respond swiftly and flexibly to issues of international concern, regardless of geographic location, the Bill will also enable us to sanction individuals and entities in coordination with key global partners, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, where it is in our national interest to do so. This reform provides Australia with an additional foreign policy tool of statecraft to define, defend and demonstrate our values, and protect the international rules-based order.

        for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With an increasing number of comparatively attractive economies joining the "Magnitsky movement", we must position Australia to act more quickly to freeze the funds of perpetrators and beneficiaries, and to prevent them from travelling here. Further delay would mean we risk becoming an isolated, attractive safe haven for such people and entities, and their ill-gotten gains. The reform will enable Australia to swiftly and flexibly deny the perpetrators and beneficiaries of egregious acts, including serious human rights violations or abuses, and serious corruption, from accessing our economy and benefiting from the freedoms that our democracy allows. This additional tool of foreign policy statecraft will allow us to more flexibly respond to situations of international concern in the national interest.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These measures will simplify the way income support payments are calculated and administered by

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These measures will also remove an anomaly whereby the more impaired a veteran is, the lower the rate of rent assistance they receive. Once implemented, the rent assistance measure will result in some highly impaired individuals receiving higher rates of rent assistance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Approximately 14,000 veterans and dependents will benefit from simpler administration of their payments. Of these people, approximately 6,900 veterans and their dependents will receive additional rent assistance. All clients (including those who will not have a change to their payment rate) will benefit from a simpler payment structure. The veteran community is particularly anxious that benefits from removing the rent assistance anomaly flow through to them as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Overall, these measures will provide much needed financial and other assistance to severely impaired veterans.

        Currently, access to DVA-funded rehabilitation services is only available once the Commonwealth has accepted liability for an injury or disease as being related to the person's ADF service, or while their claim is being determined.
