        When will all 50,300 homes fitted with foil insulation under the Home Insulation Program have that insulation removed or safety electrical switches installed?

         It might not surprise the Senate to know that I do not have the date of the last removal on an inspection process which is being commenced. What I can refer senators to is the very extensive ministerial statement given by Minister Combet yesterday, which was very upfront about the significant issues associated with this program. He outlined a number of commitments. They include a commitment to remove foil insulation or, alternatively, to install safety switches in over 50,000 homes. This, of course, is as a result of advice received subsequently—

           . If Senator Brandis had taken the opportunity to read yesterday’s ministerial statement, he would be aware that that advice was not available to Minister Garrett and has been received only recently. The second commitment the government has made is to do a safety inspection in a minimum of 150,000 homes. This is, of course, in addition to—

            , I rise on a point of order on the matter of relevance. The minister has consistently referred to Minister Combet’s ministerial statement of yesterday as if it somehow contains  the information on time lines that the minister was asked about. That statement does not contain fixed time lines or firm time lines. Minister Wong should know that. That was the point of the question. Could the minister be drawn to the point of the question—the time lines for these installations or removals.

              The minister has also indicated a commitment, as I said, that the government would undertake inspections of 150,000 homes in addition to the action taken in relation to foil insulation and he has made a number of comments in relation to more inspections. If the senator is not aware, at page 10 of the ministerial statement, Minister Combet goes on to indicate that he is working with the department on the development of the inspection program—

                 , I ask a supplementary question. If we cannot get time lines, let us try costs. What is the total cost of these inspections, removals or installations? What funding has been allocated to fix the disasters which have plagued this program and will householders who have foil insulation removed be offered replacement insulation?

In relation to costs, the Treasurer has made clear today publicly that this will be a matter considered in the budget. The government has been upfront about that. We recognise that there will be very significant—

                      As I said, the Treasurer made clear today publicly that we recognise there will be significant costs associated with this issue. Those costs will be worked through and will be dealt with as part of the budget process.

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. If the government is unable to tell us when this work will start, when it will be completed or how much it will cost, how can the 50,300 homeowners whose homes have been fitted with foil insulation or the 1.1 million homeowners who participated in this program have any confidence in Rudd Labor to fix this debacle?

                        The minister has made clear our intentions in relation to this program. I also refer the senator to the minister’s statement yesterday, in which he stated that the Australian government will fund foil removal or safety switch installation. We have been clear. This is in relation to your first supplementary question, Senator Birmingham. If you had read the minister’s statement provided to the parliament yesterday, you would have had the answers to the questions you are asking.
