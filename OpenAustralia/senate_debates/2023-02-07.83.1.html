         I thank Senator Ciccone not only for the question but for his consistent championing of human rights issues at home and abroad and for his leadership as chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to work with him.

        <p>
         I know I speak for all senators, regardless of our political differences, when I say we stand in solidarity with the people of Iran, who have demonstrated immense bravery in the face of a brutal regime. The arrest and death of Mahsa Amini, whose Kurdish name was Jina, sparked months of protests and demonstrations across Iran, and I've spoken about this on a number of occasions previously. These brave protesters have been met by brutal oppression. Hundreds are now dead at the hands of the Iranian regime, and thousands more jailed.
        </p>
        <p>
         From the beginning of this new crackdown, Australia worked strategically to build pressure internationally on Iran. This government has taken stronger action against Iran on human rights than any previous Australian government. We are at the forefront of efforts to remove Iran from the

         Council resolution establishing the independent investigation into human rights violations in Iran. Last year we imposed Magnitsky-style human rights sanctions on six individuals and two entities, including Iran's morality police, over their involvement in the Iranian regime's abhorrent, flagrant and continuing human rights violations. Just last week I announced additional Magnitsky-style sanctions against 16 Iranian individuals and one Iranian entity. In addition, we have joined partners to impose targeted sanctions on multiple Iranian individuals and entities involved in supplying and producing drones to Russia that are being used in the illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine.

            is a malignant actor and has long been a threat to international security and to its own people. The Gillard government understood this and put in place broad based sanctions on the

             IRGC

            last decade. The Albanese government has also recognised the threat they represent. That is why we are using the tools available to take action, including sanctioning of 12 IRGC-linked officials and 7 IRGC-linked entities.

           <p>

            to face consequences for its actions. I would make this point: that the purpose of listings under the code is to make it easier to prosecute individuals in Australia for supporting terrorist organisations. Listing under the Criminal Code applies to non-state actors and not state actors. The IRGC is, regrettably, a fully formed part of the Iranian state. I would note that none of our—

               community. The government is deeply concerned by reports of families and protestors being harassed and intimidated. We have put our views about foreign interference directly to the Iranian regime in no uncertain terms. The Department of Home Affairs's Counter Foreign Interference Coordination Centre is working with the community to conduct targeted engagement of foreign interference.
              </p>
              <p>
               I say this: Australia's foreign interference laws are unequivocal. Allegations of foreign interference are investigated and, if substantiated, will be prosecuted. I say to the Iranian community here in Australia: you have a right to protest. You have a right to fully participate in our democracy. We stand with you, and we will defend our democracy and people's right to protest and express their views within Australia, just as we stand up for the rights of those who do so around the world.
