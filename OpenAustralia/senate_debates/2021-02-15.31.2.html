        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. I refer to the deeply distressing story published today in which a former staff member of Minister Reynolds has made public her alleged rape in March 2019 by a then colleague in the minister's parliamentary office, and the subsequent conduct of the minister and the government. That conduct included the minister and her then chief of staff meeting with her staff member in the same room the alleged rape occurred. Can the minister assure the Senate that she and her office have exercised and will exercise an appropriate duty of care, including the provision of support for the victim of an alleged sexual assault in the minister's office in March 2019?

         I can say that of course I'm aware of today's reports and I'm extremely concerned about the wellbeing of my former staff member. Women should be safe and they should feel safe in the workplace at all times. My only priority throughout this matter was the welfare of my then staff member and ensuring that she received the support that she needed. That included ensuring that she was clear about the support available to her, and her right to make a formal complaint to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         should she choose to do so. At all times, my then chief of staff and I ensured that we sought advice from and we followed advice from ministerial and parliamentary services regarding the support available. I was at pains to ensure that my staff member felt empowered to determine how she wanted to handle the matter, and that remains the case.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the time of the initial meeting with my staff member, I was not aware of the details or the circumstances of the alleged incident in my office. Had I known, I would have conducted the meeting elsewhere. Given the sensitivities surrounding this issue, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.

           Can the minister assure the Senate that she personally ensured her staff member was referred to support services and that her staff member was accessing them, and that she made clear her personal support for the staff member to report the incident on her terms and that her job would be secure, regardless of her decision?

              My point of order is on direct relevance. The minister has not answered that question in her first answer. I know she seems to want to give one answer and then say, 'I'm not taking this any further.' It is a reasonable question to ask whether or not this woman understood that her job would be secure, regardless of her decision.

               The minister was speaking for a very brief period of time. So I've allowed you to highlight that part of the question, Senator Wong. Senator Reynolds, had you concluded your answer? You had. Senator Gallagher, a final supplementary question?

                 As I said in my first answer, my first and only concern was then, and remains, her welfare, including her right to understand all of her options and for those to be presented to her, which they were. She did continue, after this incident, in my employ and then moved to Senator Cash's office for the proceeding two years.
