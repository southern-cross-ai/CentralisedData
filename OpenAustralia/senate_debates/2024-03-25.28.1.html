        The Albanese government is delivering on our commitment of good, secure, well-paid jobs for all Australians. We want more Australians in secure work, and we want them to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. That is exactly what we're getting on with. Not only is unemployment remaining at record lows, coming in at 3.7 per cent, but 790,000 jobs have been created under our Albanese Labor government. More jobs have been created on our watch than in any first-term government on record. We know that creating jobs is our job and we haven't seen such record jobs growth.

        Wages are finally moving again. Under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        , low wages growth was a deliberate design feature of their economic architecture. That's not the case for our government. Under our government wages growth is at 4.2 per cent, the highest it has been in 15 years. And on Thursday, our government will recommend to the Fair Work Commission that real wages of Australian low-paid workers should not go backwards. Getting wages moving again is the key to helping people get in front, while dealing with the pressures of cost of living.
       </p>

        From 1 July, our government will deliver bigger tax cuts for all Australians. These changes mean that 13.6 million taxpayers will receive a tax cut and 11.5 million taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut than under the former plan. It also means that 5.8 million women will now receive a bigger tax cut. This is a big win for working families, a big win for women and a big win for middle Australia. Our economic plan is all about helping Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn, which is why we're focused on delivering strong, sustainable wages growth and more jobs for all Australians.
