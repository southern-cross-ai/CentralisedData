         I thank Senator Bernardi for the question and for his ongoing interest in the Centenary of Anzac, as well as my colleagues behind me; and indeed their fight for veterans before the last election, particularly in relation to DFRDB and the DFRB indexation issue. I thank my colleagues most sincerely.

         government is determined to ensure that local, community based commemoration is at the heart of our agenda for the Centenary of Anzac. The Australian government will be putting in some $140 million towards some very significant projects: the redevelopment of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
          World War I

         galleries, the Albany Interpretive Centre and further commemorative activities at Villers-Bretonneux and Gallipoli. But within Australia, the local, community based commemoration program is supported through the $18.75 million Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Centenary of Anzac, as honourable senators will know, is indeed about commemorating ordinary men and women who did extraordinary deeds. This local commemorative grants program is an important part of that. That is why the Abbott government has increased funding to the program to $125,000 for every federal electorate. I remember in my time in the other place, when
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Sciacca" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and he conducted the Australia Remembers program, a fantastic bipartisan support to local communities throughout Australia, from the biggest cities to the smallest towns. The Abbott government has increased funding to ensure that this occurs.

           Just finishing off: as I said before, we have actually extended the closing date for applications to 31 May 2014, three months later than originally proposed. In relation to the grants program designed to support local community programs, there can be a wide variety of potential grants to be made. Just some would be new
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           memorials or honour boards and restoration of memorials or honour boards; public commemorative events, whether they be concerts of First World War music, commemorative plays or re-enactments; preservation and interpretative displays of First World War military memorabilia and artefacts, which can include the purchase of display cabinets—a whole variety of things; conservation work; and educational projects, including research by schools. I understand a number of communities are looking at some new Avenues of Honour.

             This morning I arranged a bipartisan briefing for all members and senators, particularly lower house members, in relation to the local commemorative grants program. It was very well attended, and I think Senator Farrell and his counterpart in the other place were facilitating that. Indeed, this will be local community driven but each federal member in the other place will be required to put together a committee that will assess local application forms. That local committee will look at local applications and then they will be sent off to the department for their assessment. As I said briefly at the meeting this morning, it is important that this Commonwealth funding is used to leverage other potential sources of funding within local communities. This will be the most significant commemorative event in this nation's history and I encourage everyone to get actively engaged.
