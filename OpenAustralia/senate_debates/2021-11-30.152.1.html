        will not act against the interests of traditional owners, of land and water defenders, of our environment, of country, land, water and sky. Schedule 2 gives land councils too much decision-making power and flexibility. We will not do it. We have not seen any evidence of free, prior and informed consent. The land councils are not representative of all traditional owners. In fact, in some instances, the land councils are only representatives of themselves. Listen to the people.

        I stood outside this place this morning with Ms Burney, the Labor member for Barton. We stood side by side, supporting traditional owners and their fight to protect our heritage. I thank Ms Burney for being there this morning and for her staunch words about protecting culture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations

        heritage. She said: 'What's absolutely fundamental is free, prior and informed consent.' And I have to say that this is a priority for Labor. Cultural heritage is a living thing; it's not static. And Labor will enter into a proper consultation process. I agree with the member for Barton: free, prior and informed consent is what we need. I could not have said it better. Labor saying one thing on the lawns to the media and voting a completely different way in this chamber is why people don't trust them. We can do the right thing. We can do it today, right here right now. Vote in here like you said out there you were going to vote. Do the right thing by the people.

        Our key recommendation is that the Committee should request a significantly longer time frame for the Inquiry in order to properly consider the Bill and ensure that the amendments have the genuine free prior and informed consent (FPIC) of the Aboriginal Territorians who will be impacted, including but not limited to Traditional Owners.

        The proposed amendments to the Aboriginal Land Right Act do nothing more than to further erode the already meagre rights of First Nations in the Northern Territory (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT

        Do you know who wants this bill? The Minerals Council of Australia. Do you know why? So they can extract and steal even more profit while destroying country, culture and songlines. That should tell you everything you need to know about who this bill is really meant to serve.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Greens cannot support the bill unless schedule 2 is removed. It's as simple as that. Please think about free, prior and informed consent every time you look at your dot paintings and every time you come to a rally and scream out 'black lives matter'. Thank you.

         Labor opposes these amendments. The amendments in schedule 2 of the bill are largely administrative and technical in nature. They are designed to increase efficiencies for all parties, including traditional owners. The land councils have given evidence that, rather than these changes being proposed by mining companies, these changes have been put forward by traditional owners themselves to avoid the frustration of having to attend multiple meetings when they have already made their views clear to a land council. In other words, they were requested by traditional owners, not by miners. Labor respects the wishes of traditional owners. Importantly, none of these changes dilute the protections in the act for traditional owners. They maintain the right to a veto. That is one of the strongest protections of its kind in the country.

          The government does not support the amendments on sheet 1510. The proposed amendments would omit the commencement date for entire schedule 2—mining. And the changes to part 4 proposed in the bill would not take effect. These amendments follow from an independent review in 2013 and have the agreement of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
           Northern Territory
          </a>
          government and the four Northern Territory land councils, in consultation with key resource sector peak bodies. Importantly, the reforms preserve existing strong protections for traditional owners, including their right to free, prior and informed consent and their right to veto exploration and mining proposals on their land. The proposed amendment would not achieve increased confidence and clarity for all stakeholders and would not empower traditional owners to take advantage of opportunities on their land.

          The CHAIR ( 19:50 ): I just advise the Senate that we are dealing with schedule 2 on sheet 1510. The question is that schedule 2 stand as printed.

          The CHAIR ( 18:51 ): I will just advise the Senate that Senator Thorpe also moved sheet No. 1 on sheet 1510, but as a consequence of the outcome of the first one that falls away because it's consequential. So I'm in the hands of the Senate. Senator Thorpe.

               balance remains sufficient to fund its other obligations, including distributions to traditional owners. The bill already enables the board to appoint Aboriginal people who are not landholders to the independent and land council positions and is focused on bringing specific skills and expertise to the board. A seven-year statutory review allows time for the corporation to be reviewed against a full strategic investment plan period. Ongoing review and evaluation is a more efficient mechanism to review the impact of the other amendments in the bill. Traditional owners will retain the right of free, prior and informed group consent, including their right to veto any mining and exploration on Aboriginal land in the

                Labor will not be supporting these amendments. The bill already provides for the new corporation to have an Aboriginal controlled board and an appropriately timed statutory review. The new corporation should be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate success from its strategic investments. A review in just three years time would not provide adequate time and risks setting the new corporation up to fail, thus undermining rather than supporting increased Aboriginal control over the funds of the

                . There will be opportunities to scrutinise the corporation's strategic investment plan and progress reports, which Labor supports being tabled in parliament. We intend to make full use of these opportunities to ensure that the corporation is operating appropriately.

                     The government does not support the amendments on sheet 1477. The existing land rights act includes provisions to guarantee the free, prior and informed consent of traditional Aboriginal owners. Existing section 77A outlines the process to be followed where traditional Aboriginal owners are required to have consented. To omit the requirement for a land council to be satisfied in endorsing this consent would be contrary to the operation of the act and have unintended consequences.

                      Labor will not be supporting these amendments which seek to amend multiple provisions of the land rights act. No concerns have been raised about these existing provisions. The land rights act contains some of the strongest protections in the country to ensure the consent of traditional owners to activities on their land. It would be unwise to tamper with these provisions without a thorough process of consultation and review.
