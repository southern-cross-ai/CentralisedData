        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. I refer to the Treasurer's statement that you will be going through the budget line by line and making sure that spending is about building value and not buying votes. In light of this, will the government be honouring its pre-election promise to spend $20,000 building a 'frog bog' at Malmsbury Primary School, announced in the Labor electorate of Bendigo just 15 days before the election?

             Yes, it is. On a point of order of direct relevance, it was a very specific question relating to a pre-election promise to spend $20,000 building a frog bog. Yes or no: will that be delivered? Including: is it fiscally responsible?

               Order, Senator McGrath! Senator Henderson has raised a point of order. She is entitled to a response. You did ask a general question. You talked about line by line, and then you asked specifically in relation to a budget measure at a particular school, so the minister is being relevant.

                Thank you, President. I will get to the substance of the question. But, as you said, the senator did go to the fact that we are auditing the budget and going through it line by line, and it is really important work. It's essential work, if we are going to reprioritise within existing funding to shift the budget from political buyoffs that plagued the previous government—

                The member for New England seemed to get a lot of attention. The price of zero wasn't zero, was it Senator Birmingham? No. And we saw that in the budget with billions of dollars. The government made a range of election commitments. They're all contained in this plan, which I'm sure you all have, because it's a very, very successful plan that we took to the last election. The election commitments as outlined in this plan—

                   This document outlines all of our election commitments and their fiscal impact, and it is the government's intention, as the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions, to do what we promised we would do before the election if we were successful. So the answer to that is: where we have made election commitments, we will be delivering on them.

                     I again refer to the Treasurer's statement that she'll be making sure that spending is about building value and not buying votes, and I'm quite confused by the last response because it sounds like the minister is contradicting herself. One minute it's assessing, and the next minute it's—

                          On the point of order, earlier this week, President, you provided some advice to the chamber in relation to supplementary questions, having been asked to do so by Senator Wong and those opposite. In that advice you did encourage those making supplementary questions to ensure their supplementary question drew a link to the answer that was provided previously, which is precisely what Senator Henderson was just doing.

                               I said I would come to that after I've ruled on this point of order. I draw senators' attention to rules for questions 106 which simply say—and this has been reinforced by a number of presidents—that questions should not be prefaced by a statement. Senator Henderson, you have a second point of order?

                                       My apologies, Senator Henderson. There's been so much disruption that I was confused. I thought the minister was answering.

In light of this, will the government be honouring its pre-election promise to spend $11,000 on painting a mural at the Kingsway markets, announced in the now Labor electorate of Pearce just seven days before the election?

                                                           The first point I'd make is that I will not be lectured about buying votes by a former government that spent nine years and billions of dollars doing exactly that in every single budget. Where we made local commitments, important community investments in local infrastructure and sport that were supported by local communities, at the election—very modest programs—we made those commitments before the election. In case you didn't notice, we won the election, and we will be delivering on those election commitments in full—in full!
