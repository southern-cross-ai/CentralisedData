         These bills are necessary to implement the measures contained within the National Plan for Water Security.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The current arrangements for the management of the Murray-Darling Basin by consensus of the relevant states, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Capital Territory
         </a>
         , and the Commonwealth have failed to deliver timely and adequate responses to the accelerating over use and degradation of the water resources of the Basin.

 The National Plan for Water Security provides for these measures to be addressed subject to placing the Basin under overriding Commonwealth authority.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         These bills, together as a package, provide for Commonwealth management of the Murray-Darling Basin and are a prerequisite for the implementation of the assistance and reform measures set out in the National Plan for Water Security.

 Failure to implement the measures quickly will delay the reforms and allow the degradation and over use of the waters of the Murray-Darling Basin to compound.
