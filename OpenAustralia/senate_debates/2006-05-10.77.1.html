        My question is to Senator Kemp, representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. I refer to the budget announcement that the government will lift the cap on family day care and after school care places. Isn’t it the case that centre based long day care has been uncapped for years and yet shortages and gluts exist across the country? Doesn’t the government realise there are almost 100,000 after school and family day care places already unused in the system mainly because of the shortage of child-care workers? How will lifting the cap help?

        <p>
         Senator Lundy is correct that long day care is currently uncapped. She would have heard the loud cheers that came last night from the Australian community, particularly those with children, when the Treasurer further announced that the government will remove the limit on the number of subsidised outside school hours care and family day care places. That announcement was very strongly welcomed. With regard to long day care, you correctly pointed out that we have now built on the particular initiatives in that area.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Lundy, I am delighted that you raised the issue of child care, because I am one who has listened with great interest to Senator Patterson over a considerable period of time telling this chamber about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         ’s record in child care and contrasting that with the record of this government. I was fascinated to hear in the Treasurer’s announcement last night that, in 1996—the year that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
          Paul Keating
         </a>
         went west—there were 300,000 child-care places in Australia. The Treasurer went on to say, ‘We are budgeting for over 700,000 in 2009.’
        </p>
        <p>
         This budget recognises that the Howard government is a friend to families. When it comes to governments, this Howard government is the best friend that families have had, because we give very high priority to families. I note that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_First" rel="nofollow">
          Family First
         </a>
         senator is nodding his head. That is another strong endorsement. I say to Senator Lundy that it is true that one of the weaknesses of the ALP was in relation to child care. They never gave it significant priority. This government has given it huge priority.

             No, I have the budget measures here. In relation to the new child-care measures, the Howard government has announced in this budget an extra $120.5 million over four years for a child-care package. Let me repeat that: $120.5 million over four years for a child-care package. It announced major changes in relation to the child-care system. As Senator Lundy mentioned, we uncapped outside school hours care; we have an improved compliance strategy for the sector; and, with reference to the matter that Senator Lundy raised, we have increased funding for jobs, education and training. There is also a commitment to the child-care management system. This is a very good budget for child care. Senator Lundy is probably better off sticking to the sports portfolio; she should not have asked a question on one of the very strong points of this government.

              , I ask a supplementary question. I did ask Senator Kemp how lifting the cap will help, and I will give him another opportunity to explain how it will help families to find a place and afford the rising cost of child care. Again, why is the government extending the system that has failed to deliver centre based long day care places and applying it to the whole child-care system? Please answer the question.

               Let me draw the Senate’s attention, with respect to this criticism of the government regarding the provision of child-care places, to these two figures. In 1996, the last year of the Labor government, there were 300,000 child-care places. The Treasurer announced that we are budgeting for over 700,000 places in 2009. I think that very definitively answers the question and very definitively shows the priority that this government has given to the matter. Senator Lundy, if you are opposed to the increase in the number of child-care places which this government has provided, that makes you a one-off in this chamber. Everyone else supports exactly what this government is doing in child care and the priority that it has given to child care.
