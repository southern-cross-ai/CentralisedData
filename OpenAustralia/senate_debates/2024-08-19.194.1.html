        , a union who have a pivotal campaign on the way to address and rectify the wage discrimination faced by young Australians. In our nation, reaching the age of 18 signifies full adult status. At this milestone, individuals gain the right to vote, the right to consume alcohol and the right to serve in our military. But, despite this acknowledgement of their adulthood, young workers continue to be paid significantly less than older counterparts for performing exactly the same job. This wage disparity is not only unjust but fundamentally inequitable. If someone is legally recognised as an adult, they should receive a full adult wage for their labour, regardless of their age. Young Australians are subject to the same cost-of-living pressures as their older colleagues. They do not receive discounts on essential expenses such as rent, groceries, petrol, insurance or utilities. They're eligible to apply for credit cards and mortgages under the exact same conditions as anyone else who is an adult in Australia. In every legal and financial sense, these young people are treated as adults. Therefore, it's incongruous and unfair to continue paying young workers a reduced wage solely based on their age when they are, in fact, full adults at age 18.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reality is something of a shock to many Australians who don't operate this way in their small businesses, where they know they're dealing with an adult and pay the same wages to people doing the same job. Currently an 18-year-old worker, according to the rule—and this is applied in far too many places—is paid only 70 per cent of the adult award wage. Imagine the challenge of managing basic living expenses on 30 per cent less than the minimum wage. This discrepancy is inconsistent with the principles of fairness and equity. These values we hold as fundamental values to our country. Ignoring this issue only exacerbates the difficulties faced by young people, who are already navigating a rapidly evolving and challenging world. Yes, they too are facing the challenges that we all face regarding the cost of living.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent stories from young people have highlighted the very real struggles faced by teenagers—18-year-olds—who, despite encountering really significant life changes, lack the financial support that's provided to older workers. While some 18-year-olds may benefit from parental support, that is not universally the case. Many young people must shoulder adult responsibilities, including supporting their families, and they deserve fair compensation for their contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the presence in the parliament just last week of a group of young people. Amongst them was a young man from Victoria by the name of Cooper, who was doing incredible service to his family—dad and a couple of other kids—in trying to make ends meet. He has left school. He is working. He can't get the full adult wage because he is not eligible for it under the current conditions in his place of work, yet he is very much adulting in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that, in recent weeks, some negative attention has been directed at unions which might overshadow the essential role that unions play in advocating for workers' rights. Such instances are anomalies, rather than the norm. The union movement has historically played a crucial role in advancing workers' rights in Australia, including by securing fair working conditions, championing human rights for

        and establishing universal health care, among other significant achievements. It's important to address instances of misconduct, but it's important to stand up for fairness.
       </p>
       <p>
        I strongly urge the Senate to support the SDA's campaign against wage discrimination. It's time to ensure that all workers, especially those who are of adult age, get an adult wage.
