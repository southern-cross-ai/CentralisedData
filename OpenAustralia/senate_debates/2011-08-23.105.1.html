      <p>

      <p class="italic">
       (i)   the operator of the Eden woodchip mill in south east New South Wales, South East Fibre Exports Pty Ltd (SEFE) which is owned by Nippon Paper Industries, plans to build a 5MW biomass fired power station in Eden,
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (ii)   the biomass power plant would accelerate the damage done to the New South Wales south east forests by the Eden woodchip mill operations, inevitably using woodchips that have been produced from native forests with heavy subsidies by the New South Wales Government,
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (iii)   both SEFE and the local federal Member for Eden Monaro, Dr Kelly, have been promoting the burning of native timber as an important measure in fighting climate change, falsely claiming that forestry biomass is economic, sustainable and a low carbon energy source, and
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (iv)   biomass electricity generation from native forest feed-stocks is no longer eligible for Renewable Energy Certificates, which will threaten the commercial viability of the Eden biomass power plant; and
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (b)   calls on the Member for Eden Monaro and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig) to guarantee that no federal funding will be allocated to subsidise the operations of the proposed Eden biomass power plant.

      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (ii)   whether people attending the rally were prevented in any way different to any other Australian coming to protest at Parliament House or whether this claim by Mr Jones is also false; and
