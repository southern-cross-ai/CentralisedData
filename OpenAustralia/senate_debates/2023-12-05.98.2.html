        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. It has now been reported that a further detainee, a former ringleader of a child exploitation gang, released by your government from immigration detention, has been arrested in Dandenong amid allegations he has breached his reporting obligations and made contact with minors. It is reported that this man is a registered sex offender, previously alleged by police to have headed a prostitution ring which preyed on children in state care. A court was told how he once traded a pack of cigarettes for sex with a 13-year-old girl. You had five months of warning that the NZYQ case might not go your way, but when the orders were handed down the only thing your government was ready to do was to release these detainees into the Australian community. Minister, why can't your government keep children safe?

         I thank Senator Cash for the question. I think she would know that everyone in this chamber wants our children kept safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         There were a number of assertions in the question from Senator Cash which were not correct. The first of those was a suggestion that, somehow, we wanted to release people into the community. She knows that we are not a government that can or will instruct public servants to act unlawfully. We argued against this case—

                 I will make the point that those opposite have yet to tell us that they will support a tougher regime and have yet to tell us why they voted against the bill with the Greens to slow down the legislation to impose a tougher regime.

                 Senator Cash, when you stop yelling at everybody, maybe you can stand up and explain to the gallery why you voted with the Greens to slow down a stronger regime to protect the community. If you don't, we'll all understand why—

                   Minister, your government also made the decision to release a convicted sexual predator once labelled by a judge as a danger to the Australian community and an ongoing risk to women. Yesterday he was arrested and charged with indecently assaulting a woman in

                    The first assertion in Senator Cash's question was that this was a decision of the government. The release was a decision of the High Court. The release was a decision of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                     High Court of Australia
                    </a>
                    , a decision against which the government argued. But, as a government in this system, we are bound to observe the decisions of the High Court. I would have thought somebody who was a lawyer and the shadow Attorney-General might respect the separation of powers. Having said that, it is our first priority to work to keep Australians safe. And unlike those opposite, who are only interested in fighting about this, we are interested in working to fix it. We are working to fix it, and that is what we are doing.

                    I would remind those opposite about their inconsistency on this. First, they demanded tougher laws. Then they voted with the Greens to oppose laws to keep the community safe. First, they said to slow down, and now they say to speed up. We've done more in nine days than you've done in nine years. We know what you're doing in this—
