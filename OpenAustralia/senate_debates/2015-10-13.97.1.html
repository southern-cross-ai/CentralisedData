           I did not see the program to which you refer. I am generally aware of it. I saw a promotional advertisement for it, so I am generally aware of the kind of allegations that were made in that program. I have no basis on which to judge the veracity or the accuracy of any allegations that were made during the course of that program.

           Australia is in fact a member of the OECD Working Group on Bribery. In 2012 the working group on bribery evaluated Australia's implementation of the antibribery convention. The evaluation report made 33 recommendations to enhance our antibribery regime. In December 2014, the OECD published the response, and the OECD—

                  , I ask a final supplementary question. Can the minister give a guarantee that millions of dollars of suspect political donations linked to the Chinese government have not influenced the creation of a dodgy free trade deal which undermines Australian sovereignty, threatens Australian workers' job security and dramatically decreases scrutiny on investment from a country which is a bully, a thief, a liar and a serious security threat to this nation?

                   I think it is a great pity that you refer to the government of China, which is a country with which Australia has and has had for very many years a very friendly relationship, in those terms. I think that is very injudicious of you, Senator Lambie. You will not find me expressing anything other than pride in the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement because, for the reasons that some of my colleagues have expanded upon during question time today, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement represents a unique opportunity for Australia to prosper, to grow our markets, to grow jobs for small, medium and large businesses, and to have unparalleled entry into the market of our greatest trading partner. So we are unabashedly proud of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.
