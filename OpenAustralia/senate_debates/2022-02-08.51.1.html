         Since 1 January this year, there have been 12,088 infections in residential aged care in Australia. That's residents who have contracted the virus. Of those, the latest data that I've received is that 587 have passed away. I might add at this point that those just over 12,000 infections in 2022 are off the back of over two million infections in the Australian community. Two million—

          The interjections from the other side demonstrate that the Labor Party aren't interested in the reality of the circumstances out there. They're only interested in playing their cheap, nasty, dirty, personal politics. That's what they do.

          I would like to put on the record here today my thanks and congratulations to the sector and the workforce for the work that they have done through the pandemic and for their improved performance. In 2020, 7.5 per cent of infections in this country were in aged care. This year, in 2022, that number is 0.6 per cent of infections. That is the result of the work that the sector has done in conjunction with government. That is due to the infection control leads that were put in there and funded by the government back in 2020. It's the result of the infection control training that aged-care workers and providers have put in place. It's put in place—

             To ensure that we can receive that data—as you've said, Senator Keneally—we've put in place a taskforce to pull together that data and provide it to the community and to the parliament in a more timely way. It's very important information for us to all understand. But, in terms of the boosters, in the context of the boosters, we started the booster program on 8 November last year. On 12 November or thereabouts, we got advice to bring the dates forward, and on

                 I was going to say it's nice to see Senator Bilyk back after an absence, which it is. I thank her for the question. The focus of the government all the way through the pandemic has been to work with the health system and the aged-care sector to support both of those sectors. That has been one of the foundation elements of our approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is a pandemic. People will catch the virus, and there will be inevitable, unfortunate outcomes of that. We continue to work every day to clear up the issues that crop up in relation to the pandemic. We've acknowledged publicly that we had supply chain issues with the supply of

                 . We've got additional assistance to the National Medical Stockpile to support that. We've supplied over nine million
