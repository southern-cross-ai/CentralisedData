         The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:

         :
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Current staffing numbers have not been reduced as a result of the efficiency dividend.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The 2011-12 Budget indicates that departmental staff would increase by 200 largely due to Machinery of Government (MoG) changes. Once one-off factors are taken into account (such as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
         </a>
         , MoG changes, and establishment of the National Mental Health Commission), the department has estimated that average staffing levels will fall slightly over the year from levels as at June 2011 due to a range of factors and it is difficult to isolate the separate impact of the efficiency dividend.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) No changes are proposed to the current graduate recruitment or cadetship programs.

        <p class="italic">
         (1) There has been no specific target for staff reductions to achieve savings, however, staffing levels are being closely monitored and managed.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The Office does not have any staff reduction plans in place.

         Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor-General:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The Office has reduced staffing levels by around 14 per cent over the past 3 years through natural attrition to achieve a number of efficiency measures. Due to the range of factors it is difficult to isolate the separate impact of the efficiency dividend.

         (2) The Office does not have any staff reduction plans in place.
