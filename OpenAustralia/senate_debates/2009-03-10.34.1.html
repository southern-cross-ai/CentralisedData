        My question is to Senator Wong, representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett. The minister would be aware that the

        was ‘now in the hands of the federal government’. Minister, could this be true or is what you have been telling us the truth—that it is now up to the Queensland government to apply for approval, which Premier Bligh has indicated she would do after the election? Minister, who is right? Is it the Queensland Labor government who is peddling the story that it is your fault or are you right in saying that it is up to the Queensland government to deal with the

          Coast FM

         —I apologise for that! I welcome Senator Ian Macdonald’s continuing interest in the Traveston dam issue, although I have to say to him that obviously this is Senate question time, not a Queensland election campaign event. The advice I have—and I again remind the Senate that these decisions are governed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC
         </a>
         Act, as I previously discussed—is that the Queensland government has not yet made a decision on the proposal. However, Queensland have announced that, if they approve the dam, it would be subject to conditions which could delay construction until certain environmental mitigation measures are in place. I am also advised that the Queensland Coordinator-General is still preparing his assessment report.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I believe I have previously advised the Senate, Mr Garrett is aware of the high level of public concern about the possible impacts on a number of species that occur in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_River" rel="nofollow">

         Ramsar wetland. I again emphasise that, in his capacity as environmental regulator, Mr Garrett has kept an open mind throughout the ongoing assessment of this project and met with advocates both for and against the proposed dam to hear their views. I am advised that, if Queensland decides to proceed with the proposed dam and submits a formal assessment report to the Australian government, Mr Garrett will review that report and a range of other scientific evidence and make a final decision on the proposal. In applying that approach, Mr Garrett will obviously apply rigorously and transparently

           , I raise a point of order, which goes to the use of supplementary questions to make argument and to make allegations. I have raised this with you before, Mr President, but I think the practice is getting out of control. Consistently we have opposition senators seeking to make commentary rather than just asking the supplementary question. I think Senator Macdonald took it to a new low with his attempt to make accusations in his introduction to the supplementary question. Mr President, I raise this point of order because I do think it is becoming an unhealthy practice encouraged by the new question time format where we have seen repeated use of this practice. I do ask you to give consideration to perhaps being more firm with senators. I know you have drawn their attention to it on a number of occasions, but I do think it is becoming a practice that ought to be stamped out.

                 Before Senator Abetz jumped up I was going to go on and say that what was probably more embarrassing was that Senator Macdonald clearly wrote his supplementary question and read it out without listening to the answer to the primary question. The only part, as I recall, of his question that was relevant to the portfolio as opposed to being political diatribe was the question in relation to the Ramsar wetlands, and I already indicated in my answer to the first question that Minister Garrett was aware of the high level of public concern about possible impacts on a number of endemic and iconic species that occur in the

                 and the

                 Ramsar wetland. So I have responded on that point. In relation to the status of Minister Garrett’s involvement, I have already provided the advice I have.

                  , this minister does not listen to any questions. My question was: would the minister use the powers that he has in relation to Ramsar wetlands to stop the travesty that is occurring to the unique flora and fauna in those areas? Will the minister also use whatever influence he has with the Queensland Labor government to stop actual activities on the dam site and get them to call off the proposal now and not wait until after the election and then bring it back on again?

                     Senator Abetz suggests I am being patronising.

                     just say that the question betrays a lack of understanding of the role that Minister Garrett has under the act. I have outlined previously the status of this matter. Minister Garrett has a statutory responsibility under the act. The senator opposite seems to be suggesting that he should act outside of that responsibility. As we have previously indicated on a number of occasions in this place, as I have previously indicated and as Minister Garrett has indicated in the other place, he will discharge his responsibilities under this act in accordance with its provisions.
