          by leave—In relation to the Greens motion, what we have before us is the Greens yet again pushing their publicity buttons and desperately angling for some media exposure by putting forward a motion asking the Senate to uphold democratic principles. Will wonders never cease! This is without a doubt one of the greatest examples of Greens hypocrisy that the Senate has ever seen. Why? The only party in this Senate which does not believe in consistently upholding the principles of democracy is the Greens.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is interesting that the Greens had originally worded their motion in a vague and general manner, because we all know that when the Greens couch motions in such a way there is usually a dangerous sting in the tail of it—and do not let us forget Senator Bob Brown's ominous words about the Greens agenda.

             Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. You said to Senator Cash that she was extending from an invitation to make a short statement for two minutes. It then appeared that we were entertaining a debate in relation to the motion. I would submit that this is not the time for a debate to occur in relation to the motion. It is out of order. It is an opportunity for people to explain something about the motion rather than take a two-minute opportunity to read a written speech into the record.

               Thank you, Mr Deputy President.

                  by leave—What we are discussing here is ensuring that consumers have the right to ethically make decisions on their own. 'Boycotting' is the word at the heart of this motion, and that is in response to a motion from Senator Boswell last week. If we start to ban unauthorised boycotts, do we end up telling vegetarians that they must go to butcher shops? There are a million or so of them who do not. Does that have to be required?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Where do you end up in this process of trying to proscribe what people shall or shall not buy? This comes out of the original proposal that we should be able not to buy goods coming from, amongst others, the illegal settlements of the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                   West Bank
                  </a>
                  in occupied Palestine. Are we to say that Aust­ralians who want not to buy those products should not be able to make that choice? That is what Senator Boswell is about. We in this free country should not be proscribing these things. If people want to boycott or organise for others to boycott, that is part of the free and open democracy we have. I do thank Senator Cash for saying that the Greens are subtle—we do not want to take a sledgehammer approach like that taken by the Nationals last week or proscribe the rights of Australians. We are here to enhance them, and that is what this motion is about.
