         Mr President

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Implementation of the National Redress Scheme, I rise to table the Second Interim Report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The First Interim Report was tabled on 1 May 2020, and following its release the Committee has continued its work on various matters relevant to the maturation of the National Redress Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since its establishment in 2018, the National Redress Scheme has made both a symbolic and practical contribution to delivering justice to survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Scheme acknowledges the many children who were sexually abused, recognises their suffering, holds institutions to account, and helps survivors secure access to counselling, a direct personal response, and a redress payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        agrees that the Scheme requires continuing improvements reform to meet the needs and expectations of both survivors and the wider community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Scheme is not failing as some have claimed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The focus of this Second Interim Report is to identify reforms that will have the greatest, and most timely, potential for improving survivor participation and experience.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Second Interim Report makes 21 recommendations that reflect well understood concerns expressed by all stakeholders including survivors, redress support service partners, advocates, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        , and the Independent Reviewer, Ms Robyn Kruk AO.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report" rel="nofollow">
         The Report
        </a>
        recommends that the National Redress Scheme, through the Department of Social Services, acts immediately to ensure that all aspects of the Scheme, including community education materials, are culturally informed for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        peoples, and accessible to care leavers and people with disability. Reform must extend to ensuring that all survivors are able to make an application and be appropriately supported throughout the application process, including direct personal responses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Critically, the Committee recommends that key operational aspects of the National Redress Scheme be urgently reconsidered to ensure procedural fairness, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee also heard that there are some unscrupulous legal practitioners targeting survivors. The Committee has recommended that more be done to prevent the exploitation of survivors by some law firms and survivor advocacy businesses through legal reform. This requires collaboration between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        and all
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is pleasing to note that over the last year, Scheme reform has included encouraging institutions to join by removing tax concessions and Federal grants, legislating $10,000 advance payments to elderly and terminally ill applicants, and expansion of the Funder of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Resort" rel="nofollow">
         Last Resort
        </a>
        provisions for defunct and financially incapable institutions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee notes that the applications received by the National Redress Scheme have been more complex than originally anticipated. This has had a significant impact upon the operation of the Scheme. Now that this is well understood, the Scheme needs to be reformed to ensure that it sufficiently equipped to serve the people it exists for, the survivors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The work of this Committee has been pivotal in driving improvements to the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, during this inquiry the Committee has had the privilege of speaking with many survivors, advocates, and the staff who work tirelessly to support the National Redress Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all those who made contributions. The Committee has had regular and meaningful engagement with the Department of Social Services, and we appreciate the manner in which they have made themselves available to inform the work of the Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their collegial and the non-partisan approach during the work of the Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amidst a global pandemic, lockdowns, and the closure of state and territory borders, the Committee has delivered a worthy and timely report to further advance survivor access to the National Redress Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would also like to acknowledge the work and commitments by a former member of the Committee, Senator Rachel Siewert, who retired from the Senate earlier this year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Her commitment, energy, and passion for helping survivors with their pursuit for justice is well recognised and appreciated by all.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most importantly, the Committee extends its deepest appreciation to the many survivors and survivor groups who have continued to share their storiesâ€”these insights have been invaluable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee cannot express its appreciation strongly enough.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The work of the Committee is always for your benefit, and through our work to improve the National Redress Scheme we hope to honour your honesty and bravery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you Mr President, I table this interim report.
       </p>
       <p>
