        My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, and recently reformed smoker, Senator Sherry. Assistant Treasurer: today being the anniversary of the Rudd government’s decisive action in launching the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, how is this strategy, designed to protect Australia from the worst effects of the global recession, progressing? How does the government plan to keep Australia on its recovery course and ahead of the pack as the world emerges from the global recession?

         I am very pleased to answer both questions—but I will leave for another time the one on cigarettes. Seriously, this is a very important day because it is one year ago today that the Labor government took decisive action and announced the implementation of its Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, a $42 billion plan to cushion the Australian economy from what was then rapidly emerging as the worst financial and economic crisis the world has seen in some 75 years. It is also the anniversary of the day when the Liberal-National Party gave up and just determined its policy would be to sit back and do nothing about the emerging world economic and financial crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was on this day last year that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced the historic, long-term and targeted plan as a decisive step in the government’s response to the severe global recession. A progress report has been released by the Commonwealth Coordinator-General. It shows almost three-quarters of the infrastructure projects in the stimulus plan are completed or underway. Some 49,179 projects have been approved, 34,850 projects have commenced and 8,339 have been completed. Over half of the $42 billion stimulus package has been injected into the economy through businesses, households, and state, local government and various construction projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         The report also confirms that, without the stimulus, unemployment in Australia would be some 200,000 greater. We would be well on the way to almost a million unemployed but for the stimulus package—

            . Is the Assistant Treasurer convinced by opinions against maintaining the stimulus? Is he aware of the warnings of the dangers of withdrawing the stimulus too early and plunging our economy into the recession the Rudd government’s decisive action has managed to avoid?

             Australia’s unemployment rate is 5.5 per cent. The unemployment rate in Europe and in the United States is approximately 10 per cent—almost double the Australian unemployment rate.

                 . If we had adopted the Liberal-National Party prescription to do nothing, we would have had close to a million unemployed. Remember the opposition Treasury spokesperson,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
                  Mr Hockey
                 </a>
                 , saying, ‘Jobs, jobs, jobs—Australia will have a million unemployed,’ this time last year. That is what he was saying. We took decisive action. You opposed that decisive action. We know the outcome would have been the same outcome that we have seen in Europe and the United States: almost 10 per cent—a million—unemployed. The evidence is very clear.
