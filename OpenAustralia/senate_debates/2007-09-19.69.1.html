          Purpose of the Bill
         </b>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The bill corrects an unintentional requirement that in the course of deciding an application for registration the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHI" rel="nofollow">
          PHI
         </a>
         AC) must refuse the application if the rules of the private health insurer, relating to both health insurance business and health related business, permit improper discrimination.  The improper discrimination provisions have always applied to health insurance business which is insurance products that cover hospital and general treatment.  Health related business covers overseas visitors’ health cover, dental and optical clinics.  It was not intended to subject health related business to the improper discrimination provisions. Unless an amendment is made it will have a particular impact upon the provision of insurance to overseas visitors and could mean that private health insurers are not prepared to offer overseas visitors’ health cover.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Two provisions in the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 (PHI Act), unintentionally require health insurers to community rate overseas visitors’ health cover. This was not the policy intention, and amendments need to be made to a provision regarding re-registration and an offence provision in the PHI Act to allow health insurers to risk rate these products.  Health insurers will then be able to compete on a level playing field with general insurers who offer overseas visitors’ health cover.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Amendments to the PHI legislation are also required to provide that APRA regulation and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSR" rel="nofollow">
          FSR
         </a>
         requirements of overseas students’ health cover do not come into effect until 1 July 2008. This would align overseas students’ health cover with overseas visitors’ health cover (which is not subject to APRA regulation or FSR requirements until 1 July 2008), and would give the affected insurers enough time to change their business practices to comply with the new requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To allow pharmacists to continue to substitute other brands of other pharmaceutical items of the same drug that are marked as equivalent and are considered to be interchangeable in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits. An unintended consequence of the National Health Amendment (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
         </a>
         ) Act 2007, which amended the National Health Act 1953, was to inadvertently restrict this substitution, which is an important element of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Restricting pharmacists from carrying out this role will have adverse effects on pharmacists, consumers and the pharmaceutical industry.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This amendment will restore the substitution of pharmaceutical items to its original legislative and policy intent.

        <p class="italic">
         Prior to the enactment of the PHI Act overseas students’ health cover did not have to meet the requirements of general insurance and was not subject to APRA standards or FSR regulation.  APRA has raised concerns that in effect the overseas students’ providers may be offering general insurance without a general insurance license, which attracts a criminal penalty of $35,000 a day.

         It is critical that the increased funding is made available to the Cape York Institute with as much lead time as possible to permit the appropriate delivery of MULTILIT and SETs for these students from the beginning of 2008.
