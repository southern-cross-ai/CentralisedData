        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Today Australians woke to the horrific news of an attack at Westminster in London. On behalf of all Labor senators, and I am sure all senators, I express our solidarity with the people of Britain, our sympathy for those lost in this terrible attack and our condemnation of terrorism in all its forms. I ask the minister to update the Senate on the steps the Australian government has taken to support and offer assistance to Britain on behalf of the Australian people.

         Thank you, Senator Wong, for giving me the opportunity to update the Senate on the events in London overnight. As senators will be aware, five individuals have now died and around 40 people have been injured in the terrorist attack on the British parliament building yesterday afternoon, London time. London metropolitan police have confirmed that the five deceased include one police officer, three civilians and the attacker. While the investigation is still ongoing, British authorities have confirmed they are currently operating on the belief that this attack is the result of Islamist related terrorism. I am sorry to have to tell the Senate that, contrary to earlier reporting, an Australian permanent resident has been hospitalised in London with injuries sustained in the attack. Our consular staff in London are offering her assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
         As Prime Minister Turnbull said this morning, the attack on the British parliament is an attack on parliaments, freedom and democracy everywhere. We condemn the attack and are deeply saddened by the loss of innocent life. Prime Minister May this morning rightly described the attack as 'sick and depraved' and commended the exceptional bravery of the police and security services who continually risk their lives to keep their citizens safe. We stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time. In the face of such tragedy, Australians can be reassured that our agencies and police forces are working relentlessly to keep us safe. May I conclude by echoing the words of the Prime Minister this morning: we will never let the terrorists divide us or challenge our democratic way of life and the freedoms which we cherish.

           I thank the minister for that answer. Given Australia's long and deep relationship with Britain, can the minister outline how our two countries are working together in order to defeat terrorism?

            Yes, I can. We work at a ministerial level, at an agency level, at a policing level and at a diplomatic level to defeat and thwart terrorism. As Senator Wong knows, Australia and Britain are both members of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes" rel="nofollow">
             Five Eyes
            </a>
            group of nations, the closest intelligence partnership in the world. Through the Five Eyes arrangements we share intelligence. I can tell the Senate that that intelligence sharing arrangement has been responsible for alerting Australian authorities to, and preventing, terrorist strikes at home. Our agencies and our police forces operate very closely together. They are close collaborators. There are officers of Australian police and agencies located with British agencies, and the reverse is true as well.

               Yes I can. The government has responded to the increased threat from Islamist terrorism in Australia and overseas by enacting the most comprehensive program of national security legislation reform in a generation. Each of the eight tranches of legislation, which I have introduced into the Senate, I am pleased to say have been passed with bipartisan support, and I thank the opposition for that. The government has also invested an additional $1.5 billion to support Australia's efforts in combating terrorism. Since the threat level was elevated in September 2014, our law enforcement and security agencies have disrupted 12 planned terrorist attacks in Australia, the most recent disruption being the

               attack in Melbourne, which, had it been successful, would have resulted in significant loss of life. Sixty-two individuals have been charged with offences.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the time remaining to me, might I remind senators of the National Security Hotline 1800 123 400, which all members of the Australian community should access should they have concerns about the behaviour of individuals.
