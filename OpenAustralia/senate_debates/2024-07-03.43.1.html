        Minister for City Services, Tara Cheyne, and federal member for Canberra, Alicia Payne, I announced $10 million of joint funding, with each government committing $5 million for the road safety program. This money will fund 18 priority areas across the ACT. This program represents a vital step forward in our ongoing efforts to enhance road safety and reduce the road toll in our community.

        Road safety is a critical concern that affects each and every one of us. Every year too many people are killed and countless others have their lives changed forever. It is our collective responsibility to address this issue with the urgency and commitment it deserves.

        The collaboration and commitment between the federal government and the ACT government is crucial for building a safer, moreâ€”
