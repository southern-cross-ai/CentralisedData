        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Minister Gallagher. Minister, the budget reinstated Medicare item 288. We wanted item 288 reinstated, but Tuesday's budget measure doesn't go far enough: it only applies to video conferencing. What are you doing to support people who don't have access to video conferencing and can't attend an in-person appointment?

         ALLAGHER (—) (): I thank Senator Tyrrell for the question, and for a heads-up on the question so that I could get some advice from the minister's office. I understand that the minister for health, Minister Butler, has been engaging with the Jacqui Lambie Network on this matter and will continue to do so, and that on 6 October the department of health and members of the minister's office met with the Jacqui Lambie Network—I'm not sure if it was with your office, Senator Tyrrell or with Senator Lambie's—to have a discussion on these matters, and that will continue.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the issue of telephone consults versus video-conference consults: it's hard to remember because of how intense the last few years have been, but phone telehealth hasn't been an option that's been available prior to the response to COVID-19. In my discussions with doctors—and I think this probably reflects the minister's position too—I've heard that the accepted view across the health workforce is that face-to-face and video services better support patient care and patient outcomes and should be the preferred forms of consultation with patients, particularly when there are Medicare items relating to more complex care arrangements. And this is particularly the case in long-form consultations of over 45 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is committed to evidence based care and telepsychiatry services. Consultations that are longer than 45 minutes should either be face to face or delivered via videoconferences. But I accept the point about people finding it difficult at times to get in front of videoconferencing and can find it hard to access services. I'm sure the minister's office will continue to talk about those, particularly in your local area.

          <p>
           We all know elderly people find it hard to use Zoom—well, not all of them but some—and that people in regional areas don't have good internet. Why is the government insisting on videoconferencing? Surely if it's a choice between the phone or nothing, you would rather have people on the phone.

           <p>
            I certainly accept that in areas across the regions and particularly where there are workforce shortages as well, which affects regional communities, accessing healthcare services can be difficult. There is a very strong regional communications package in this budget which goes to strengthening regional communities' access to internet and at good speeds. So that is part of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, again, I think the clinical preference is to have face to face, in person or video presence, for consultations, particularly for complex care, and often geriatric or elderly care falls under that criteria. If there are other options available, I'm sure the minister will engage with you, recognising there are some particular challenges in Tasmania with accessing primary health care. We've got urgent care clinics and—

              I think the minister actually answered my third question in answer to my second question. So I might just skip out of the third—and I know that's rare.
