        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Can the minister outline to the Senate the problems associated with previous approaches to offshore processing and how the government has worked to remedy the situation?

         will be well aware that offshore processing has always been at the centre of a coalition government's border protection policies. Offshore processing worked as part of the suite of measures under the former Howard government, and the results under the Abbott government are clearly showing that offshore processing is working again.

        <p>
         The former Labor government—or the former Labor governments; I keep having to remind myself that there were three of them—dismantled offshore processing. The Australian public are now left, quite literally, with the policy disaster that resulted: over 50,000 people arrived here illegally by boat, over 1,000 confirmed deaths at sea; and a budget blow-out of almost $12 billion. I give those on the other side credit, though: they realised they made a huge mistake. We know that, because they had to side with us when we were in opposition to restore offshore processing. I do remember, however, that they were literally dragged kicking and screaming to this place in complete and utter embarrassment when they realised that they had to restore that which they had dismantled with such disastrous results. Unfortunately when we assumed office—even though offshore processing had been restored with the support of those who are now on this side—it was a dismal attempt to restore offshore processing. The former government underfunded offshore processing and refused to provide the necessary infrastructure to ensure that offshore processing would indeed work. It has been left to us—

           This government's commitment to offshore processing is resolute and it is reflected in the number of people who have now been transferred to offshore processing centres since the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders. I am pleased to advise the Senate that since the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders, this government has transferred a total of 1,527 illegal arrivals to Nauru and

             The government is continuing to remove illegal arrivals who are found not to be in need of Australia's protection. I can advise the Senate that as at 9 am on Friday, 7 February there were a total of 145
