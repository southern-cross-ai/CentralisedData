        My question is to Senator Sherry, the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister confirm that the government’s razor gang has scrapped $800,000 of funding for the Bonnie Babes Foundation, an organisation which provides counselling for women who have experienced the tragedy of giving birth to a stillborn baby?

         Thank you for the question. In representing the minister for finance, I do have some information for you. Where a specific program is dealt with, in terms of the minister for finance and my representational duties, it is best the question goes to the relevant minister and their portfolio responsibilities. However, I do have some information. I do want to assist the senator where I can. The government understands, in the case of the Bonnie Babes Foundation—this is in respect of assisting grief counselling—it is important when a woman or family tragically lose a baby. The previous government made a commitment for new funding prior to the election for the establishment of a toll-free number. This was made during the caretaker period and was not a continuation of existing funding. Of course, the government already provides funding for grief counselling 24 hours a day through Lifeline. Members of the opposition may not be aware—

           . Members of the opposition may not be aware that the former Prime Minister was actually approached by a number of similar organisations for funding support, including not only Bonnie Babes but also Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support, SANDS. The government will consider all such requests for support as part of its broader maternity services review.

             , I ask a supplementary question of the minister. The question related to the activities of the razor gang that is cutting numerous programs to the most disadvantaged in our community and causing concern throughout the most disadvantaged sectors of our community. Given that Labor have announced a federal grant of $2.6 million to urgently fix a dead tree in Queensland and build a Labor memorial to it and you have saved a paltry $800,000 here, what other vital counselling services do you intend to scrap to get the other $1.8 million?

              As I have indicated to the senator and to the Senate generally, the government is considering requests for support in these particular areas, such as the Bonnie Babes Foundation. The Labor government did not make a specific funding commitment in the lead-up to the election; it was in fact the former government. The former government made a specific election commitment. So, in the context of the request by the Bonnie Babes Foundation and Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support for funding—and I am sure there are other organisations that provide this support—it will be considered as part of funding requests in the context of the broader maternity services review.
