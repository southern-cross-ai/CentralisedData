              <p>
               I thank Senator Brown for the question in my capacity representing the Minister for Defence. I have seen the reports in the press in the last few days about these matters and the treatment of prisoners at
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib" rel="nofollow">
                Abu Ghraib
               </a>
               . All senators were shocked, I know, at the time at the terrible abuse and mistreatment that occurred in that centre, and it was the subject of much questioning in the Senate estimates process. Senator Faulkner and, I think, Senator Bishop and I spent a great deal of time—I think I was shadow defence minister at the time—questioning Defence officials about these matters. I think Senator Hill was the minister at the time. We attempted to get to the bottom of what Australia's involvement was in these matters. But I would point out that the key point here is that, in contrast to the arrangements in Afghanistan, the ADF did not act as the detaining power during joint operations in Iraq. We were not the detaining power. As you know, Senator—through you,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                Mr President
               </a>
               —Australian personnel are required and trained to treat detainees humanely and with dignity and respect. My advice is that ADF personnel consistently acted in accordance with international and Australian domestic law on those detainee issues. In terms of Major George O'Kane's role in this matter, all I know is that he did provide situation reports which did not contain reference to incidents of abuse and that those reports were made through our reporting channels. I am not aware of any role in drafting regulations regarding treatment of detainees, but I again make the point that we were not the detaining power for those detainees.

I would like, though, to again stress that we were not the detaining power and that there was an attempt to have accountability on these matters at the time, with Labor pursuing these matters at Senate estimates. But it is also the case that

It is quite clear that there were failings in the way this process was managed. The images from

                  , I have a further supplementary question to follow up on the Public Interest Advocacy Centre's revelation. I ask the minister: will he hold an independent inquiry into what is clearly a cover-up by Prime Minister Howard and Defence Minister Hill at the time of Australia's role in events at

                   I am not aware of any plans to conduct an inquiry into these matters. I will take the question from Senator Brown on notice and ask Minister Smith for any further advice. As I say, there was an attempt in this parliament to hold the defence department accountable for any involvement we might have had. I stress again that we were not the detaining power, but there were legitimate concerns about what advice was being provided and the reporting of the treatment of those detainees. It was a matter handled by the previous government. The minister has no personal knowledge of those matters and members of this government have no personal knowledge of those matters. But, as I understand it, there is no current intention to conduct an inquiry following the information released in the last couple of days. I will refer the question to
