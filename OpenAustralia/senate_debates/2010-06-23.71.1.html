                  program. The Building the Education Revolution program is the largest single investment in public education the

                   Commonwealth of Australia

                  has ever seen. It has provided a massive expansion in educational opportunities for every child in this country—a proposition that the Liberal opposition have opposed. They have opposed providing those opportunities to Australian students across the 10,000 schools in this country.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On top of the extraordinary length of measures that this government has taken, the

                   BER

                  Implementation Taskforce has been established to provide additional assurance to the Australian public that the BER program is being implemented in accordance with the guidelines that the government itself established for achieving value for money. This government is concerned about any allegations of any impropriety in the Building the Education Revolution program.

                  To date, widespread practices of over-quoting, over-charging or fraudulent behaviour have not been found. The evidence simply is not there for the claims that the opposition is making. Nonetheless, it is open to the taskforce to refer potential breaches of the law, regulations or guidelines to appropriate authorities for investigation.

                   , I ask a supplementary question. Last night at a Senate committee hearing, the Commonwealth Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations gave evidence that, out of more than 10,000 school building projects, the department had never refused to approve a project on the grounds that it did not provide good value for money. Can the minister therefore guarantee that each one of the more than 10,000 approved projects is providing taxpayers with good value for money?

                    projects that have been approved in around 9,000 separate schools in Australia. As of 30 April, 8,092 projects were under construction at 6,121 schools around the country. Of course, there are some other projects that are yet to commence. I am looking forward to the answer to the question, ‘Which of these projects is the Liberal Party going to stop?’ Which ones are you going to stop? How many of the openings are you going to turn up to?

                                  I can advise the Senate of the facts—not the opinions; the facts. The fact is that the task force returns its first report in August and it may of course lead to further ongoing recommendations to responsible authorities relating to the improvements or actions that need to be taken. The fact also is that the opposition has opposed this program, yet is only too happy to turn up to the openings and claim credit for any initiatives that are taken to improve opportunities for Australian children. It is time for the opposition to come clean. Which of these programs will they stop? Which schools will they prevent from getting access to the biggest program the Commonwealth has ever seen in terms of improving opportunities for the children of this country? It is time for the opposition to come clean. It is time for the opposition to state what its position is. Do you support children getting these services or not?
