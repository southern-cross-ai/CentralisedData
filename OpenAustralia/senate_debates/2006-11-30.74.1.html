        My question is to Senator Kemp, the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services. Will the minister please update the Senate on measures being developed as part of the government’s drought assistance program to help communities at this time of severe drought?

         I thank Senator Ferris for this very important question. Senator Ferris knows only too well that the current prolonged and severe drought is having a significant impact on many Australian communities. I noted in the chamber earlier this week some of the government’s drought assistance measures in response to the current drought, particularly for local communities. The government, as I mentioned, has committed more than $1.1 billion in drought assistance for farmers and farming communities in the last two months alone. This is in addition to the $1.2 billion that the Australian government has already spent on drought assistance measures to date. This brings the government’s total package of measures to help communities and individuals through this difficult time to more than $2 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Department of Human Services, through its agencies Centrelink and Medicare, has an important role in ensuring farming communities have access to government services and assistance. For the last three weeks, a drought bus has been making its way through regional Australia, providing a link between farmers and the relevant support services, including counselling staff. I am pleased to report to the Senate that rural communities have warmly embraced this service. Specialist rural support staff on the bus have been on hand to issue exceptional circumstances certificates on the spot. They can also provide farmers with the information that they need to apply for assistance and they can even help fill out the paperwork.
        </p>
        <p>
         The feedback on the drought bus has been very encouraging. It is obviously providing an important service. More than 80 per cent of those who have spoken with staff from the drought bus have never previously approached the government for drought assistance. In fact, I am advised that more than 580 farmers have signed up for assistance for the first time. This is why the Minister for Human Services,

         , and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry,

         , today announced the extension of the drought bus program. Two new drought buses will join the existing mobile service unit, making their way through western

         </a>
         and Queensland as of next week. The government’s drought bus program proved that there is an obvious need for this kind of service and the two extra vehicles will ensure that we are able to provide drought assistance and other support services to those who need it most. As well as general drought assistance advice, the drought bus offers counselling services for farming families struggling to cope with the emotional impact of the drought.
        </p>
        <p>
         People in rural communities will also have access to Medicare staff, who can assist with non-cash transactions such as Medicare claims, enrolling people for Medicare or updating their personal details. People within these communities have also been able to speak one on one with rural service officers and financial information service officers. The first drought bus, I am advised, has travelled more than 3,000 kilometres so far and the two new buses will travel this distance or more. As the two buses will be signed up to the green fleet program, 219 trees will be planted to offset the 56 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually.
        </p>
        <p>
         We hope farming communities will continue to take advantage of the expertise being offered through the drought bus services. As we all know, the drought is having a very severe impact on our farmers and communities across Australia, and the Australian government and its agencies stand ready to provide the support that they need to help them get through this very difficult time.
