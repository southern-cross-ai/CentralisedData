           I say thank you to Senator Urquhart for her very good question. I know about her ongoing interest in the Australian tourism industry.

           's Best Jobs in the World campaign is part of an important international push to increase awareness of Australia as a working holiday destination. Working holiday makers are targeted because they are responsible for a significant amount of the tourism sector's key overall contribution to Australia's economy. At eight per cent of total exports, tourism is Australia's largest services export industry. The sector generates $107 billion in consumption, employs more than 500,000 Australians and directly contributes $41 billion to our economy. More than $25 billion is generated by international tourists and about 10 per cent of that comes from working holiday makers. Working holiday makers also deliver benefits to regional Australia, with 75 per cent of international backpackers spending time in our regions. Regional stays account for 40 per cent of nights spent in backpacker accommodation.
          </p>
          <p>
           This government is committed to support through Tourism Australia high-quality marketing of our nation as a tourist destination for overseas visitors. As I mentioned earlier, the Best Jobs in the World campaign aims to increase awareness of Australia as a working holiday destination, but with its strong online and social media focus it also has broad appeal to the youth tourism market more broadly, which makes up more than a quarter of Australia's international tourism contribution to our economy. The Best Jobs in the World campaign is an exciting, interactive and extremely effective way to support continued growth in this important key tourism export market. The campaign supports the great work of Australia's tourism operators, with the support of this government, towards meeting—

             I once again thank Senator Urquhart for her question. The campaign has already been a big win for Australia's tourism industry. There were more than 620,000 applications and about 46,000 video entries from people in 196 countries. Many applicants ran social media campaigns as part of their entries and the 18 finalists have been busy blogging about their activities in Australia this week.

             's survey shows that 70 per cent of entrants plan to apply for an Australian working holiday visa, 40 per cent within the next six months; 78 per cent have researched an Australian holiday; 77 per cent have recommended Australia to others as a working holiday destination; and 61 per cent have visited Australia's immigration website for more information on our working holiday maker program.

This week the 18 finalists have been taking part in tasks and challenges that will help the state and territory tourism organisations select the six ultimate winners. These activities will also help prepare the finalists for the work they are doing. The winners will promote Australia's unique destinations and experience to potential working holiday makers from around the world. The winners will be announced in Sydney tomorrow.
