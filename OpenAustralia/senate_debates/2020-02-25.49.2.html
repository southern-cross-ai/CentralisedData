           Thank you very much, Senator Ciccone, for your question. Mr Norton is absolutely right. The meat and livestock industry has made a commitment as a part of the agriculture sector to work towards their contribution to making sure that carbon emissions in Australia are kept as low as possible. Just like the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
            National Farmers Federation
           </a>
           , the meat and livestock industry is also part of the commitment by the agricultural sector to play a very important role in the Australian economy. In fact, I note that the National Farmers Federation, as part of their global roadmap towards 2030, have also committed to increasing the output of this industry to $100 billion. That's up from $60 billion to $100 billion, which is a very significant increase. I commend the agricultural sector for the innovative ways that they are addressing the expansion of the agricultural sector.

             For those opposite, I would like to point out that the agricultural sector is a huge supporter of regional Australia. The Australian economy rode on the sheep's back, and it still does. The agricultural sector, whether it's through the meat and livestock industry, through the grains industry, through our fabulous horticultural sector or through our marvellous wine industry, all understands that Australia's future is going to be built on a future that does address the issues of carbon emissions. However, as the leader in this place has said constantly, the Australian Morrison government is not going to recklessly commit to a target of 2050, like you are, just because you think it is a good idea. We will be targeted in our focus about how we address our economy and emissions.

               ABARES estimates that over the last two decades more than $1 billion—that's right, $1 billion—has been wiped from annual agriculture production due to climate change. Does the minister accept the University of Melbourne's recent findings that failure to reach net zero emissions, which is required to meet our obligations under the Paris Agreement, is estimated to cost $211 billion in agricultural and labour productivity losses?

                First of all, there is much in Senator Ciccone's question that I would actually reject the premise of. However, what I would say is that what we are delivering as part of our policy as the Australian Morrison government's energy policy is what the Australian public voted for in May last year. It doesn't matter what you come in here and say. The fact is that the Australian government is absolutely committed to effective climate action that actually delivers an environmental result. But, at the same time, we're not going to be economically reckless and we are not going to put up people's prices.

                   That was part of the question. I had trouble hearing the minister's answer during my constant pleas for silence. I've let you remind the minister of the question. She has 17 seconds remaining.

                    I'll just reaffirm that I rejected the premise of some of your question. However, I would say that this government actually accepts the science of climate change. We will continue to work in a responsible and effective way to address that.

                       : 'We've got a policy position. That policy position has been in place since 2018, and it's part of our roadmap towards a $1 billion agricultural sector. As part of that roadmap we would like to move towards carbon neutrality in 2030'—and here's the bit you need to listen to, Senator Ciccone—'so it's not that we would be carbon neutral by 2030, or by 2050 for that matter. What we have said is that we need to be trending towards a net zero approach by 2030.'

                       So, I think you also need to be very careful, when you come in here and make these accusations, that you are absolutely correct in what you are making the assumption of, Senator Ciccone.
