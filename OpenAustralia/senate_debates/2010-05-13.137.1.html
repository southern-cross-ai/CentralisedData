        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner. I refer the minister to the government’s announcement, in the context of the budget, that the Australian government will invest $1.1 billion for enhanced force protection capabilities in Afghanistan over the period 2009-10 to 2012-13. Can the minister advise the Senate of the steps the government is taking to protect our troops in Afghanistan from Taliban attacks?

         The government’s and, I know, the parliament’s highest priority is the safety and protection of Australian troops and civilian personnel serving overseas. Our personnel work in dangerous conditions in Afghanistan where the risk of Taliban attacks is part of the reality of everyday life. One of my first decisions on becoming defence minister on 22 July 2009 was to direct a comprehensive review of the protection provided to our troops in Afghanistan to ensure that they did have the full range of protections that were required. Appropriately, the review was conducted mostly in the theatre of operations.
        </p>
        <p>
         In response to the force protection review, the government will invest $1.1 billion for enhanced force protection capabilities in Afghanistan over the period 2009-10 to 2012-13. Since the review was completed, Defence has been working hard to progress and implement the outcomes of the review. Some measures have been implemented already, including improving countermeasures against improvised explosive devices,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
          IED
         </a>

         , as well as a range of other vital capability enhancements. I can assure the Senate that this work will continue to be progressed as a matter of priority.

           to develop options to deploy the best currently available counter-rocket artillery and mortar system as a matter of the highest priority. Of course, such a system is vital given the ongoing threat from insurgent rocket attacks. I can confirm that the government has approved acquisition of this capability with funding in the budget. It will provide a sense and warn capability which detects projectiles in flight and warns our forces of incoming threat. Elements of the system should be in place by the end of 2010, with subsequent progressive delivery of improved levels of protection.

             As all senators would be aware, our forces in Afghanistan currently face a very high risk from both insurgent operations and improvised explosive devices, and of course a high risk from indirect fire. Accordingly, the government’s investment in force protection capabilities includes a range of measures to provide direct protection for ADF members from small arms,

             s and indirect fire. So, in addition to C-

             , improved route clearance capabilities, enhanced protection and firepower for protected mobility vehicles, new night fighting equipment, improved body armour, a new weapons system for special forces, additional military working dogs and a suite of improved intelligence and reconnaissance capabilities.

              My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sherry. Has the government undertaken any modelling into the impact of the compulsory three per cent increase in payroll costs for employers on employment levels or wage rises? How much does the government forecast this increase in the levy will cost Australian workers in wage rises forgone?

               Thank you for raising the very important announcement that was part of the tax package announced just over a week ago relating to the improvement in what is known as the superannuation guarantee. The superannuation guarantee, as you have indicated, Senator Ryan, is to be increased from three to nine per cent—

                increased from nine to 12 per cent, sorry—I was reflecting on history and the well-known opposition of those opposite to all improvements in the superannuation guarantee. I well recall the debate around the three per cent and its economic and wage impact. I recall the debate on the superannuation guarantee, which took the minimum contribution from three to nine per cent. I recall the debate—

                 and the modelling. Although I do not recall the details of the modelling from that period. But I certainly recall the debate and discussion about the issues that Senator Ryan is raising, about the issues with respect to employment and the issues with respect to the wage impact. I well recall the debate on the three per cent and the nine per cent. I look forward to the debate and discussion on the legislation to take the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent. I should also remind Senator Ryan that it was a commitment of the former Liberal government, I think, in 1996—

                  on 8 August 2008 the minister commented:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  … one of our election commitments was we will not be increasing the 9 per cent super guarantee which is payable by the employer. We have ruled it out and we will be sticking to that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Does the minister stand by those comments?

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. I appreciate that the minister admits he made a comment of a similar or like nature and will check it. I assume then—and this is another one he might check—that the minister is also retreating from his comments on radio 3AW on May 14 last year, when he said the government would ‘absolutely not’ increase the compulsory superannuation levy. How can anything he or this government says be trusted? Why shouldn’t employers fear that it will just go up to 15 per cent next?

                        , on a point of order: it is an issue where the opposition and other senators are entitled to raise a point of order when they choose to. But, in this instance, we do not have a genuine attempt to raise a point of order; what we are now seeing is the opposition continually raising and restating the question and, in some instances, restating it differently from the way the original question was raised—which is impermissible—and then asking the minister to be relevant to that subsequently asked question, which is paraphrasing their first, which is not the case. The minister has been relevant to the question and is answering it in a way that provides certainty in this place and ensures that his answer is accurate rather than taking the paraphrased, restated question that the opposition have sought to raise.

                          I am not surprised to hear the messages of doom and gloom from those opposite about superannuation. These claims were made many years ago and they turned out to be not true. I recall the Liberal opposition committing to increase superannuation to 15 per cent in its election promises in 1995 leading up to the 1996 election, and they broke it in 1997.
