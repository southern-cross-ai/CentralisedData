        During the pandemic, many of us used this opportunity to explore our own backyards, get out bush or go up the coast. Some people may or may not know just how many of our tourism businesses are owned and operated by

        people. It is a relatively small part of the Australian tourism sector, but a vitally important part for our mob.
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment for First Nations people in the tourism sector provides an opportunity for mob to stay on country and earn an income by maintaining and sharing their culture and traditions. First Nations cultural tourism can provide an important source of income, particularly in regional and remote areas where other job opportunities are limited. It has been found that the number of international tourists taking part in First Nations cultural tourism activities is increasing, which is welcomed. Often, there's a joke that Australia has no culture, but as First Nations people, we do. We have a very rich cultural heritage that spans across the whole country, with art, song, dance, stories, scientific knowledge, food, traditions and law. In most cases, First Nations communities welcome the chance to share this incredible knowledge, as it has been passed down for thousands of years. We are the oldest continuing culture in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the tourism sector recovers from COVID lockdowns and border closures, First Nations tourism ventures need to be given support as Australia markets itself as a place to travel to. The government must genuinely include and promote First Nations owned and operated tourism ventures. Further, I urge travellers to ensure that, when they go out bush, onto the coast or anywhere in this country, they know whose land they are actually on, and make sure that they make an effort to learn about the community's unique culture and stories. Support First Nations local businesses and participate in First Nations cultural tourism activities.

        said that poorly managed tourism was one of the factors putting cultural heritage at risk. We need to do better and protect our precious places, sacred sites and unique landscapes.
