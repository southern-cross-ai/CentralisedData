        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Ludwig. I refer to reports that Dean Mighell, boss of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETU" rel="nofollow">
         ETU
        </a>
        , a significant donor to the

         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        and to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        , is the subject of an internal audit for the sale of the majority stake in an ETU financial advisory firm for a 10th of its value, a potential loss of half a million dollars of union members' funds? And further, that statements made by Mr Mighell that the ETU continue to receive funds have been contradicted by Mr Tony Devlin who took full control of Southern Alliance Financial Services? Is Fair Work Australia investigating these matters to ensure that union members' funds are not being misspent and, if not, why not?

         I thank Senator Bushby for his question. In terms of the Victorian Electrical Trades Union allegations, under this government the regulation of registered organisations and financial service providers has never been stronger. We have recently amended the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act to require that officers must disclose material personal interest in a matter that relates to the affairs of their organisational branch and that obligation extends to the officer or a relative of the officer. Organisations and branches must disclose this information to members. We have introduced tough new laws to tackle conflict of interest in financial planning and superannuation. Changes made also require organisations and branches to disclose payments that have been made to related parties of the organisation or branches and other persons or bodies. A 'related body' is defined to include entities that are controlled by organisations or officials of the organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trade unions are overwhelmingly professional and democratic and they represent the interests of members in a highly effective way. Australia has had a long and free independent trade union movement that is representative of and accountable to its members. Trade unions are overwhelmingly, as I said, professional, democratic and highly effective.

I refer to reports that bosses of the Australian Maritime Union, which is affiliated with and a major donor for the Labor Party, are hindering police and government efforts to clean up the ports following allegations of rampant corruption, crime, gangs, armed smuggling and drugs. Is Fair Work Australia investigating these matters as possible contraventions of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act?

                I thank the senator for his ongoing interest in industrial relations. Dealing with news reports today concerning allegations—perhaps it is worth while finalising the Victorian
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETU" rel="nofollow">
                 ETU
                </a>
                matter—are the subject of Federal Court proceedings. This government is on the side of accountability for representative organisations. We have proposed and have moved the Fair Work Act to deal with that. If there are allegations of impropriety then they should be reported to the relevant body so they can be investigated. If the senator has information that is relevant then he should refer the matter; he should not sit on it and use it in question time. I am confident that Fair Work Australia, as an independent body, will independently investigate matters that, if you say are true, can be raised and put to it.

                  I thank the senator for his question. As I was saying, if he does have evidence of the serious allegations that he raises he should provide them to the relevant authority. I am confident that Fair Work Australia, according to its charter, will investigate all those matters, if they have substance and are brought to their attention.

                  I will ask Minister Shorten if there are further matters that he wishes to respond to on the second supplementary question.
