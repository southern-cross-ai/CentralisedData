        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. Does the minister think that the arrival of 29 boats carrying 1,301 new asylum seekers proves that the Rudd government’s new border protection policies are working?

         I thank the senator for the question. The Rudd Labor government remains absolutely committed to strong border security measures. That is why in the 2009 budget an additional $654 million was dedicated to a whole-of-government strategy to combat people-smuggling as part of the Rudd government’s $1.3 billion strategy to strengthen national security and border protection. We have established a dedicated Border Protection Committee of Cabinet to drive the whole-of-government strategy to combat people-smuggling and to ensure that the government’s efforts are fully coordinated and resourced at levels which enable us to quickly respond to the factors that contribute to regular people movement. We have also created a single point of accountability for matters relating to the prevention of maritime people-smuggling within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Customs
         </a>
         and Border Protection Service. They will create a more effective capability to task and analyse intelligence, coordinate surveillance and on-water response and also engage internationally with source and transit countries to comprehensively address and deter people-smuggling throughout the operating pipeline from source countries to our shores.
        </p>
        <p>
         The challenge is real and the challenge remains. As I have said previously, we have had boat arrivals in more than 20 of the last 30 years. This is an ongoing problem for Australia, as it is an ongoing problem for the world. Reports indicate that the number of people around the world seeking protection or seeking to move is increasing all the time. We see the international engagement and the regional engagement commenced under the previous government as a vital component of a successful policy to combat people-smuggling, but it is an ongoing challenge and we remain committed to trying to end people-smuggling.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister’s answer. I note that he does not include in that the fact that the government has reduced this year’s Customs budget by $58.1 million. He does not include abolishing detention debt. He does not include removing the 45-day rule for onshore protection visa applicants.

            . Nor does he include providing 24 new portable accommodation units to the refugee processing outpost, in order to house the extra people that people-smugglers are bringing in, at a cost of $1.5 million to the Australian taxpayer. Can the minister advise why he has not included these amongst his list of so-called policies that are deterring people-smugglers?

             I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for what I think was a question. It actually sounded a bit more like a combination of the shadow minister’s press releases, which are incredibly confusing. When you bring them all together they are a complete mess. What we have done is try to implement a policy that is absolutely committed to strong border security and that enhances our border control and border patrolling. Also, we make no apology for the fact that we have introduced legislation measures to ensure a more humane treatment of refugees who have arrived in this country. We made that very clear. A number of the coalition’s own backbenchers have seen fit to support that. I think the Australian community has moved on to understanding that you can have strong border security and humane treatment of those found to be under your protection. I suggest that the Liberal Party, rather than calling for an inquiry, actually work at trying to find a policy that perhaps takes account of modern circumstances.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister tell the Senate when the Rudd government will reverse its program of softening border protection that gives people-smugglers the green light and return to the previous strong policies which saw no unauthorised boat arrivals in Australia in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 under the Howard government?

               The senator seeks to repeat the catchcry of ‘soft on boarder security’, but that is all the Liberal Party have got. There is no policy and half the time they do not oppose the measures that we recommend. I remind those opposite that under the Howard government 5,516 unauthorised arrivals arrived in 2001; 2,900 in 2000; and 3,700 in 1999. Were you soft on boarder security then? No. What you were dealing with was the challenge of a surge that occurred at that time, just as earlier governments such as the Fraser government had to deal with the surge of Chinese arrivals in its period. These things occur as a result of people who have been forced out of their home countries seeking asylum. What we have seen over the years is that these figures go up and down as people seek to find safety. I am afraid that will continue—
