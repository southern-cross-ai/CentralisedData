        I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of Senator Hill and to add my sincere personal best wishes to Robert on his departure from this place today after what can be described as nothing less than a quite remarkable parliamentary career. Few people leave this place having occupied as high an office for as long as Robert did not scarred by political misadventure or involvement in covert political acts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert and I have known each other, and shared challenges and successes as colleagues, for many, many years. Robert has a very lively, intelligent mind and a great sense of humour. But as you probably know personally, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, he always sought to be in control of all situations through thorough preparation. In this parliament it is not easy to develop close friendships but I can genuinely say that Robert and I were close friends. I value this fact and will continue to do so after he leaves parliament to pursue the next phase of his life. Because of this, I am saddened to see him leave, as I believe he has been one of the most valuable and constructive contributors to the operation of the Liberal Party and this parliament for so many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert has occupied one of the most challenging roles in this parliament, that of Senate leader of the coalition, both in opposition and, then, for a decade, in government. For most of that decade, he has had the job of facilitating the smooth operation of a coalition government which did not always have a controlling majority in the Senate. I believe it is a compliment to his skills as a negotiator and diplomat that he was able to carry out this role so successfully. He will take these valuable skills to his next role and will hopefully find them to be of equal use in

        , although in a very different environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Hill first arrived in Canberra with a level of enthusiasm and reforming zeal seldom seen in new senators. He had an enlightening, lively and questioning approach to many of the tasks he confronted. It is most satisfying to be able to acknowledge that he maintained this refreshing approach throughout his time here. It is not surprising he was so popular. Robert and his wife, Diana, honoured me with their presence at a dinner to note my own 25 years in the Senate, an occasion facilitated and hosted by the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Calvert" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Calvert
        </a>
        . It was an occasion at which I was able to personally express my appreciation for his personal and professional friendship and the meaningful relationship we had developed sharing long-term roles as senators in this place and, earlier, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I said it was sad to see Robert depart from the Senate because I know that he has always been a positive and active contributor to so many areas of debate and, more importantly, to the development of policy issues. He has always had a particular expertise and interest in foreign affairs, and he has put this interest to good in many of the roles that he has been given in parliament. He has occupied an extraordinary number of offices in this place. I believe that he will also put his interests and skills to good use in his new role, hopefully reforming and rejuvenating the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . That will certainly be a great challenge. I am sure that the outcome will be just as positive as his achievements in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert, in your absence, I wish you every success in your new role and in your life after politics. I know that you will continue to serve the Australian nation and people with verve, dignity and honour. Thank you for your friendship, your immense contribution to the work of this Senate and your uniquely refreshing positive outlook on life. I wish you all the very best.
