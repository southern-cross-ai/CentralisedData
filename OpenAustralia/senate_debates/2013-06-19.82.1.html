         Digital Economy
        </a>

        In early 2011, details on these quality guarantees for free-to-air coverage of

        matches will be announced and legislation to amend the anti-siphoning scheme will be introduced into the Parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister now outline why, two years past his self-imposed deadline, he has failed to pass legislation and will he finally confirm that, after creating significant uncertainty for stakeholders and stringing this process out for 2½ years, he has given up on legislating these reforms?

         I thank the senator for his question, because the answer is very simple: you and those opposite. You have voted and ensured that this bill cannot pass the chamber. We brought forward a package of reforms that we have enacted in practice. You opposed it in the House of Representatives, and you have indicated you will vote it down in this chamber. You will vote it down with the Greens. Those opposite are once again demonstrating they do not understand what they are talking about. I will take this opportunity to congratulate the Socceroos for their fantastic win last night in qualifying for the World Cup and give you some evidence of how the policy is working in practice. Last night, because of all the deals that we put in place that you are opposing and will not let pass in this chamber, over 500,000 Australians watched it on Foxtel, and 1.7 million Australians—that is more than 2 million Australians—got to watch the Socceroos qualify for the World Cup because of this government's policies. As you would all know if you live in Sydney and Brisbane, or in Canberra particularly, you now get to see live

             , I ask a supplementary question. I remind the minister of his on-again, off-again antisiphoning legislation fiasco in September last year, when he withdrew the bills humiliatingly before even bringing them to a vote in this place. I note though that the antisiphoning bill was scheduled on the House of Representatives draft legislative program for debate this week. Will he inform the Senate what changes to the legislation he was proposing, what consultation there had been, why it was listed in the House this week and why it will now apparently not be proceeded with?

              , once again, those opposite are blocking the passage of the bills. Then they stand up and say, 'It's a disgrace. You haven't passed the bill.' Do not block it! We have introduced reforms that see more Australians watching live sport than ever before. We know exactly what your position is. It has been communicated many times. The issue that has been at debate is that you and the Greens have decided to block the entire package on the basis of an agreement reached between the

               AFL

              and other sporting codes about reducing the number of matches that would be on the antisiphoning list, and, despite the front page of the

              , which as always you take as your mouthpiece, as your propaganda vehicle, and which completely and utterly misrepresented the position, there is currently an antisiphoning list that protects these sports. We were seeking, with agreement, to reduce that. That has not been possible because you—
