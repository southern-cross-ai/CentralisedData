         The Government
        </a>
        will consider options to improve overall clarity. In particular the Government will review the drafting of the Australian Privacy Principles to avoid repetition of requirements that are substantially similar.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.32 The committee recommends that reconsideration be given to the inclusion of agency specific provisions in the Australian Privacy Principles in the light of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner's suggestion that agency specific matters should, in the first instance, be dealt with in portfolio legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Not accept
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not agree that it is appropriate for all specific agency activities to be included in portfolio legislation. While portfolio legislation will normally provide the lawful authority for an agency to undertake certain powers, functions and activities, it is also necessary in exceptional circumstances to take the additional step of including specific exceptions in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APP" rel="nofollow">
         APP
        </a>
        s to make clear that specific activities of agencies will not contravene APPs obligations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some of the exceptions have been included to provide additional certainty about the operation of the APPs on legitimate activities undertaken overseas, including those in urgent or emergency situations. Others preserve existing exceptions in the Information Privacy Principles (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPP" rel="nofollow">
         IPP
        </a>
        s), eg that enable the collection, use/disclosure etc of personal information for law enforcement purposes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the case of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        exceptions in APP 3(3)(f) and APP 8(2)(i), they are intended to clarify the circumstances where the collection of sensitive information may occur without consent outside Australia, and where personal information generally may be disclosed to an overseas recipient. The Defence Force undertakes a range of activities in other countries that involve the collection and disclosure of personal information (sometimes in remote and emergency situations) and it is important that there is certainty about its ability to undertake these activities without breaching the APPs. For readability purposes, it is also important to clearly outline how these activities interact with APPs obligations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Similarly, in the case of agencies with diplomatic and consular functions or activities, there are exceptions in APP 3(3)(e), APP 6(2)(f) and APP 8(2)(h), that are intended to clarify that such agencies can collect, use/disclose etc such information both within and outside Australia. Government officials from agencies such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        ) who are based overseas regularly collect and disclose to their agencies in Australia personal information as part of its diplomatic and consular functions. It would be impractical for DFAT and other agencies to seek the consent of foreign government officials and other individuals, about whom these agencies report to Australia, to collect and disclose their personal information to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        . Moreover, the act of seeking this consent would undermine the success of DFAT's core operations by revealing to the subject of such information flows that they are occurring. Similarly, it is necessary for government officials based overseas to report to DFAT in Australia in discharging its consular responsibilities, especially in the event of an overseas crisis where overseas officials are expected to assist Australians. The exceptions in APP 3(3)(e), APP 6(2)(f) and APP 8(2)(h) are not new exemptions to existing privacy laws, but seek to clarify the interactions between DFAT's and other agencies' existing functions and the APPs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As with the Defence Force exception, it is important that there is certainty about the ability of these agencies to undertake these activities without breaching the APPs. For readability purposes, it is also important to clearly outline how these activities interact with APPs obligations. The Government will work with the OAIC to develop appropriate guidelines on the exceptions relating to diplomatic and consular functions and activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to note that certain Commonwealth agencies, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrimTrac" rel="nofollow">
         CrimTrac
        </a>
        , operate in a unique fashion within the APP framework. In the majority of circumstances, CrimTrac operates as the custodian of personal and sensitive information; it is not the primary collection agencies. The allowances at APP 3 (3)(d) will ensure that CrimTrac can continue operating effective national sharing solutions that support law enforcement and policing across Australia, without breach.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On the general exemptions for law enforcement activities, these already exist in the IPPs (eg IPP 10(1)(d) and IPP 11(1)(e). It is important that these are retained to ensure that law enforcement bodies have clarity that the activities they can undertake with personal information at the moment will continue to be the case under the new APPs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There has been careful consideration given to the inclusion and breadth of agency specific provisions in the proposed APPs and the Government considers that each is justifiable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.73 The committee recommends that the Office of the Australian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         Information Commissioner
        </a>
        develop guidance on the interpretation of 'personal information' as a matter of priority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Support
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that OAIC guidance on the interpretation of the 'personal information' would be useful in assisting entities and individuals to understand the application and scope of the new definition, especially given the contextual nature of the definition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government encourages the development of appropriate guidance by the OAIC. The Government notes that the allocation of OAIC's resources to develop guidance and its timing is a matter for the OAIC. The Government will encourage the OAIC to liaise with entities in developing guidance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.90 The committee recommends that the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner develop guidance on the meaning of 'consent' in the context of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Privacy Act
        </a>
        as a matter of priority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Support
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that OAIC guidance on the meaning of 'consent' would be useful to provide clarity to entities and individuals about the application and operation of that term. The Government notes that this is consistent with ALRC recommendation 19-1 that also recommends that the OAIC should develop and publish further guidance about what is required of agencies and organisations to obtain an individual's consent under the Privacy Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government encourages the development of appropriate guidance by the OAIC. The Government notes that the allocation of OAIC's resources to develop guidance and its timing is a matter for the OAIC. The Government will encourage the OAIC to liaise with entities in developing guidance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.114 The committee recommends that the Government, in consultation with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, give consideration to the provision of a transition period for entities to fully comply with the implementation of the new Privacy Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Accept
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees with the Committee that the introduction of the new Australian Privacy Principles will require entities to develop and implement changes to practices and policies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will therefore consult with the OAIC and other relevant stakeholders in determining an appropriate transition period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CHAPTER 4 – Australian Privacy Principle 1 – open and transparent management of personal information
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4.45 The committee recommends that a note be added at the end of APP 1(5) which indicates that the form of an entity's privacy policy 'as is appropriate' will usually be an online privacy policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Accept in principle
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes the Committee's concerns on APP 1(5) and will look to develop appropriate amendments to the draft legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also notes that the Committee considered that the provision should be re-drafted to clarify that privacy policies must be available to both individuals and entities (para 4.44). The Government will also look to develop appropriate amendments to the draft legislation on that issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CHAPTER 5 – Australian Privacy Principle 2 – anonymity and pseudonymity
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 7
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.37 The committee recommends that the wording of APP 2(2)(a) be reconsidered to ensure that the exception to the anonymity and pseudonymity principle cannot be applied inappropriately.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Accept in principle
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will reconsider the wording of APP 2(2)(a) and consider options to clarify that the 'required or authorised by or under an Australian law' exception applies at the time that the identification of the individual is required by the entity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further, as noted in the Committee's report (para 5.32), the Government accepted an ALRC recommendation (16-2) that encourages the development and publication of appropriate guidance by the OAIC to clarify when an act or practice will be required or authorised by or under law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that the allocation of OAIC's resources to develop guidance and its timing is a matter for the OAIC. The Government will encourage the OAIC to liaise with entities in developing guidance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CHAPTER 6 – Australian Privacy Principle 3 – collection of solicited personal information
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 8
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6.35 The committee recommends that in relation to the collection of solicited information principle (APP 3), further consideration be given to:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Accept in part
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not support the removal of the term 'reasonably' from the 'necessary' test in APP 3.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The requirement on entities to collect only personal information that is reasonably necessary to their functions, requires the collection of personal information to be justifiable on objective grounds, rather than on the subjective views of the entity itself. This is intended to expressly clarify that the test is objective (rather than implied) and to enhance privacy protection.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Making it clear that the necessity of the collection must be reasonable is intended to reduce instances of inappropriate collection of personal information by entities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes the Committee's view that it remains to be persuaded that the inclusion of 'reasonably' provides a higher, or even the same, level of privacy protection as the wording in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPP" rel="nofollow">
         NPP
        </a>
        1. To give reassurance to the Committee, this will be made clear in the Explanatory Memorandum when the final bill is introduced in Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that the application of the 'directly related to' test to organisations should be reconsidered. The Government will look to develop appropriate amendments to the draft legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CHAPTER 7 – Australian Privacy Principle 4 – receiving unsolicited information
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 9
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        7.44 The committee recommends that the term 'no longer personal information' contained in APP 4(4)(b) be clarified.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Accept in principle
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that further clarification about the term 'no longer personal information' would be beneficial for entities in applying APP 4.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers this should come from guidance developed by the OAIC. Such guidance would provide clarification about the process of rendering personal information 'non-identifiable', or the steps necessary to destroy personal information. This flexibility is necessary because de-identification procedures may evolve over time and may differ depending on the form the information is held in (eg electronic v non-electronic). In addition, OAIC guidance will be useful in outlining how to destroy or render non-identifiable personal information that forms part of other information or records (eg historical records).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The OAIC guidance would also be useful in advising about the other elements in APP 4(4) that are relevant to the requirement to destroy or de-identify, ie how to apply the 'as soon as practicable', and 'lawful and reasonable to do so' test in APP 4(4).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that this is consistent with ALRC recommendation 28-5 (which the Government accepted) that the OAIC should develop and publish guidance about the destruction of personal information, or rendering such information non-identifiable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government encourages the development and publication of appropriate guidance by the OAIC. The Government notes that the allocation of OAIC's resources to develop guidance and its timing is a matter for the OAIC. The Government will encourage the OAIC to liaise with entities in developing guidance.
       </p>

        CHAPTER 10 – Australian Privacy Principle 7 – direct marketing
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 10
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        10.46 The committee recommends that the drafting of APP 7 be reconsidered with the aim of improving structure and clarity to ensure that the intent of the principle is not undermined.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Accept in principle
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes the Committee's general concerns about the drafting of APP 7 and will consider options to improve clarity and structure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 11
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        10.60 The committee recommends that the note to APP 7(1) be redrafted to better reflect the position outlined in the Government response.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Accept in principle
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will look to develop appropriate amendments to the draft legislation to clarify the operation of the 'Direct Marketing' Principle to agencies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 12
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        10.66 The committee recommends that the Australian Information Commissioner develop guidance in relation to direct marketing to vulnerable people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Support
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that OAIC guidance about direct marketing to vulnerable people would be beneficial to entities in understanding their privacy responsibilities when engaging in direct marketing to individuals such as children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that this is consistent with ALRC recommendation 26.7(e) (which the Government supported) that the OAIC should develop and publish guidance to assist organisations in complying with the 'Direct Marketing' principle including 'the obligations of organisations involved in direct marketing under the Privacy Act in dealing with vulnerable people'.

        In some instances, international partners may not enter into agreements where the terms are to be made publicly available.

        The Government believes the use of the term 'similar' is sufficiently clear and narrow to ensure that an enforcement body can only disclosure personal information to an overseas recipient that is a like body.

        The Government notes the Committee's view that any exception to the identifiers principle should only be applied where it has been objectively determined that it is necessary for a permitted purpose. The Government believes the inclusion of 'reasonably' in the current wording of the exceptions in APP 9 expressly (rather than impliedly) clarifies that the test for disclosure is objective. This will have the effect of enhancing privacy protection by encouraging more appropriate disclosures of government related identifiers by organisations.

        The Government notes the Committee's comments elsewhere in the report about whether the use of 'reasonably' when used with 'necessary' provides a sufficiently high level of privacy protection compared to the existing NPPs, where an objective test is implied. To give reassurance to the Committee, it will be made clear in the Explanatory Memorandum to the final bill that the use of 'reasonably' is intended to confirm the use of an objective test, and therefore to provide the same level of protection.
