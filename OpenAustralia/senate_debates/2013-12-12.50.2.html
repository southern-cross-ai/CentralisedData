          Given what is likely to happen in relation to even minimalist gambling reform, I thought it was important to revive the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, which did do a lot of useful work. It had an oversight role. It looked at gambling addiction, gambling reform and matters that needed to be attended to especially at the Commonwealth level. I think it would be a terrible shame, notwithstanding the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">

          's position to withdraw its previous support for some minimalist legislative reforms, to not have this committee continue to do the very good work it was doing.

             I rise to say that the Greens will not support this motion, not because we, like Senator Xenophon, are not committed to tackling problem gambling. In fact, when it comes to poker machine reform, I am tempted to say that Senator Xenophon and the Greens are on a unity ticket, although unity tickets are not what they used to be. We spent three years on the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform fighting very hard to see gambling reform achieved in this parliament. We thought we got somewhere. We heard evidence from experts right across the spectrum: from the industry, academics, activists and people who were affected. It seems that what we have here is not a lack of evidence but a lack of action. If anything, we need not an inquiry into gambling but a joint select committee into political courage and the power of vested interests in this country.
