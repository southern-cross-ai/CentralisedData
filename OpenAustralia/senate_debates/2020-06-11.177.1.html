        Senator McAllister to move on the next day of sitting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) during the coronavirus pandemic, there has been an increase in violence against women and their children,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) at least 23 women have been murdered so far this year at the hands of a current or former partner in Australia,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) on average, more than one woman a week is murdered by a current or former partner,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) violence against women and their children will continue to worsen in the face of job losses, stand-downs and financial stress and uncertainty, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) domestic and family violence services funding was inadequate before the COVID-19 pandemic; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) calls on the Morrison Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) follow Labor's call to convene a National Summit on violence against women and their children, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) urgently provide more support for frontline domestic violence services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator McAllister to move on the next day of sitting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted women's economic security:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (A) in April over half a million Australians lost their jobs, of which 55 per cent were women,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (B) women's underemployment ratio now sits at an unprecedented 16 per cent, compared to 14 per cent for men, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (C) modelling has estimated that more than 200,000 women casual workers in the accommodation, food services, and retail trade sectors alone will miss out on the JobKeeper wage subsidy;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) women typically retire with half the superannuation balance of men and, if they choose to withdraw funds, women will suffer a significantly greater impact on their retirement income than men,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) Australian women have been on the frontline of the COVID-19 crisis in Australia in underpaid and undervalued roles:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (A) women account for 87 per cent of registered nurses and midwives,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (B) women account for 87 per cent of aged care workers, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (C) women account for 96 percent of early childhood educators, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) as a result of COVID-19, mothers are spending an extra hour each day on unpaid housework and four extra hours on childcare; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) calls on the Morrison Government to recognise that women have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and address women's interests in their recovery plans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Griff to move on the next day of sitting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the law in relation to financial transparency in the aged care sector, and for related purposes.
        <i>
         Aged Care Legislation Amendment (Financial Transparency) Bill 2020
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Siewert to move on the next day of sitting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) there has been a dramatic increase in Australians accessing public services due to the economic and social impacts of COVID-19,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) now more than ever we need to be strengthening our public services for people who need support, not making these services more difficult to access,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the Government intended to close the Abbotsford (Yarra) Service Centre on Thursday 21 May 2020, but in the face of strong community objection agreed to keep it open for a further three months,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) the Government now intends to close the centre in three months, despite the landlord publicly stating Centrelink could remain on the premises and despite clear community need,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) unnecessarily closing this Centrelink Service Centre will harm and inconvenience thousands of vulnerable people reliant on it, and that suggesting that people travel to a Centre almost 7 km away is not only unfair, but inappropriate at a time when people in Victoria are being told to stay at home and encouraged not to use public transport, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) on 21 May 2020, after receiving news of the imminent closure of the Abbotsford (Yarra) Service Centre, Yarra councillors passed two motions which respectively direct Yarra Council to liaise with Services Australia over possible temporary and long-term sites for a Centrelink Service Centre in Yarra; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) recognise the value of public services and commit to keeping the Abbotsford (Yarra) Service Centre open permanently, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) abandon any plans to shut down any further Centrelink Service Centres while Australians are experiencing the impacts of COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Pratt to move on the next day of sitting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) investments in developing and deploying vaccines, and helping to strengthen health systems, can enhance global health security by reducing the incidence of, and protecting children from, preventable diseases, enabling them to live longer and healthier lives, and contributing to poverty reduction,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) in 2000, governments of many countries, and multilateral health organisations and philanthropic organisations created Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), a public-private partnership to expand access to new and underused childhood vaccines, reduce the incidence of deadly and debilitating diseases, prevent epidemics and save lives,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) since 2000, Gavi has supported country-led vaccine programs in 73 countries (16 of them in our region), enabled immunisation of at least 760 million children, helped avert an estimated 13 million deaths, and contributed to a 70 percent reduction in the number of deaths globally due to vaccine-preventable diseases,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) Gavi has pooled vaccine demand from implementing countries — expanding the global supplier base for vaccines, enhancing the competitiveness and security of vaccine supply chains, and creating efficiencies expected to achieve an estimated $
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        900 million in savings, which can help accelerate access to vaccines between 2021 and 2025, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gavi has allowed implementing countries to reallocate up to 10% of their health support funding to domestic COVID-related needs, and has also launched COVAX, an innovative finance mechanism that will provide access to any vaccine against COVID-19 in the countries where Gavi works – an important first step in ensuring equitable access to a vaccine, and a role similar to the one Gavi played in the development and distribution of an Ebola vaccine; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) on 4 June 2020, the United Kingdom hosted Gavi's third replenishment, the Global Vaccine Summit, with an ambitious goal to raise $US7.4 billion in new donor commitments,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) with this renewal of resources, Gavi plans to support the immunisation of 300 million more children against potentially fatal diseases and save an additional 7 million to 8 million lives between 2021 and 2025,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) at the Summit, Australia, which has been a consistent contributor to Gavi since 2006, stepped up with a pledge of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AU" rel="nofollow">
         AU
        </a>
        $300 million, a 20% increase on our previous pledge, which will support improved access to vaccines throughout our region, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) the Global Vaccine Summit raised an impressive total of US$8.8 billion in pledges, which will save lives, reduce poverty and protect against the threat of epidemics globally over the next five years, adding to the US$150 billion in economic benefits already derived from Gavi-supported vaccines in participating countries since 2000.

       <p>
        Senators Bilyk, Sterle and Keneally to move on the next day of sitting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) 1-7 June 2020 was World Haemochromatosis Week, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) Sunday, 14 June 2020 is

        </a>
        ;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) hereditary haemochromatosis, or inherited iron overload disorder, is treated through therapeutic venesection,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) subject to Australia Red Cross Lifeblood's safety requirements, blood collected through therapeutic venesection can be donated, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) treating haemochromatosis not only helps patients avoid the worst outcomes of the disorder but may save further lives by adding to Australia's blood supply; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) urges all members and senators to raise awareness among their constituents that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) haemochromatosis, if left untreated, may be debilitating and fatal,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) being tested and treated for haemochromatosis will also benefit others, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) Australians should remember the mnemonic "
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEST" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        — Tricky to say, Easy to test, Simple to treat, Tragic to ignore."

        <i>
         Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902

       <p class="italic">
        (b) acknowledges:
