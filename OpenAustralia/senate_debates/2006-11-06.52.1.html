         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1)

        , Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 131. These Regulations specify revised provisions concerning the regulation of persons, vessels and aircraft within the

         The Committee
        </a>
        raises the following matters after considering these Regulations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        First, new subregulation 8.04(3) creates a strict liability offence if the person operating a vessel fails to move away from a cetacean at “a constant slow speed”. The same phrase is used in paragraph 8.05(2)(a), which is also a strict liability offence. This imposes an imprecise obligation on a person operating a vessel. The Committee therefore seeks your advice on whether the subregulation should be amended to specify a particular speed, or range of speeds, to provide certainty in the application of these strict liability offences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Secondly, the Committee would also appreciate your advice as to why regulation 8.09A, which specifies certain offences concerning swimming with cetaceans, does not include a defence, similar to that found in subregulations 8.05(6) and 8.06(4), stating that it is a defence if the cetacean has approached the person.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Similar comments apply to subregulation 117D(3), paragraph 117E(2)(a), and regulation 117J of the

        Dear Senator Watson
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I refer to your letter of 10 August 2006 concerning the
        <i>
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1)
        </i>
        , Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 131 and the
        <i>
         Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1)

        <i>
         your reference 113/2006
        </i>
        ).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am pleased to offer my advice on the two matters referred to in your letter:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The wording in new subregulation 8.04(3) was changed from the previous wording of ‘at a constant slow speed, so that its wake is negligible’ to that of ‘a constant slow speed’ after consultation with vessel operators and consideration of operating conditions encountered in the marine environment. The speed at which a vessel generates a wake is dependant on its construction and configuration, its loading, sea conditions and other environmental factors. Some vessels generate a ‘no wake’ condition at high speed (when planing)—others can generate ‘wake’ at very low speeds in certain conditions. The important factor to consider is ensuring the operation of the vessel is such as to minimise any negative effects on cetaceans, whilst at the same time not being so restrictive that it compromises the safety of those on board the vessel. The decision was taken no to impose a speed limit (such as at 4 knots or below 6 knots) for safety reasons as vessels may be required to maintain a higher speed to counter the conditions. In addition some vessels may not have equipment on board to indicate their speed of travel. Animals are more likely to be affected by sudden increases or decreases in speed or direction, that in the actual speed or consistent operational behaviour of a vessel. The proposed wording of ‘a constant slow speed’ was seen in the light of these considerations to be appropriate, and it is my preference that they be retained.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Regulation 8.09A differs from 8.05(6) and 8.06(4) in not providing a defence if a cetacean approaches a person as regulation 8.09A already states that the person must not enter the water within 100 metres of a whale or 50 metres of a dolphin, or if already in the water, must not approach a cetacean within 30 metres. Regulation 8.09A(4) that states that if a cetacean comes within 30 metres the person should undertake certain actions, so this in effect negates the need for a defence against breaching that distance, providing the person behaves in a certain way. Regulations 8.05 and 8.06 set limits of 100 metres on the approach distance of the vessel to a cetacean, but then provides for a defence if the cetacean approaches the vessel.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The same comments apply to subregulation 117D(3), paragraph 117E(2)(a), and regulation 117J of the

         Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1)

        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I trust this explains the reasoning and thinking behind the wording in the revised

        Dear Minister
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 11 September 2006 responding to the Committee’s concern with the strict liability offences relating to the movement of vessels around cetaceans in the
        <i>
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1)
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1).
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In your response you advise that the decision not to impose a speed limit on the movement of vessels around cetaceans was made for safety reasons as vessels may be required to maintain a higher speed to counter the conditions. The Committee accepts that there may be practical reasons for not specifying a speed limit and that in this instance your preference is to retain a requirement to move at ‘a constant slow speed’.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is, however, still a question about the definition of ‘slow’ when determining whether a boat is moving at a ‘constant slow speed’. The Committee is concerned that this is a strict liability offence as it is difficult to see how a boat operator will be able to determine if they are complying.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee therefore suggests that either a tangible measure be adopted to enable a boat operator to determine if they are complying with the manner in which they are obliged to move away from a cetacean or the strict liability be removed from this offence.

        Dear Senator Watson
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I refer to your letter of 14 September 2006 concerning the strict liability offences relating to the movement of vessels around cetaceans in the
        <i>
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1)
        </i>
        , and the
        <i>
         Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) Amendment Regulations 2006 (No. 1)
        </i>
        (the Amending Regulations).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I note the Committee’s continued concern with the use of the term ‘constant slow speed’ in the Amending Regulations. The wording of these offences has been further considered and it is proposed that, in order to resolve the Committee’s concerns, the term ‘constant slow speed’ be replaced with the term ‘constant speed less than 6 knots’. This will provide the tangible measure of speed that the Committee has requested thereby removing any potential uncertainty to the operator of a vessel as to the speed that they are required to travel to meet their legal obligations under these provisions. It is proposed that the offences remain strict liability offences and in this regard the Criminal Law Branch of the Attorney-General’s Department has advised that the revised wording is suitable, from a criminal law policy perspective, for the offences to apply as strict liability offences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I therefore would like to give an undertaking to the Committee that the provisions of the Amending Regulations in which the term ‘constant slow speed’ is used, will be amended so that the speed that a vessel is required to travel when near cetaceans will be ‘less than 6 knots’.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe that if the changes that I have suggested are made they will ensure that it will be clearer to the operators of vessels how they can comply with the regulations, whilst still enabling the regulations to be enforceable. I trust this will satisfy the concerns of the Committee. Should you wish to discuss these matters further please do not hesitate to contact me.

        directs a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken particularly where a proposed instrument is likely to have an effect on business. Section 18 of the Act provides that in some circumstances consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate. The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Act requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken. The Explanatory Statement that accompanies this instrument makes no reference to consultation. The Committee therefore seeks your advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation.
