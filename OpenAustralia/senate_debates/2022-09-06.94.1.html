        <p>
         Today the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, otherwise known as ABARES, released their latest report on Australian crops and commodities. This year farm exports are forecast to worth a record-breaking $70.3 billion, which is a remarkable achievement. This is the biggest ever agricultural export in our nation's history. I am shocked that the National Party, of all parties, wants to yell at us when we have good news for farmers and good news for agriculture. But, then again, when you see what the—

           It's a shame they hate good news, even when it comes to farmers and agriculture. But, then again, it's no surprise when we see what the Leader of the National Party has to say about the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
            National Farmers Federation
           </a>
           , calling them cowards and all sorts of other things as well. This is the biggest ever agricultural export our nation has seen. ABARES has also forecast a winter crop harvest of 55.5 million tonnes. This combination of high yields and high exports is good news for Aussie farmers, farm workers, rural communities and all of us in this country. It also means that Australia can do its part in contributing to global food supply.
          </p>
          <p>
           Over on this side of the chamber, we like good news, especially when it comes to agriculture and our farmers. It's unfortunate we're not joined by the other side. We know that trade and exports make all the difference in times of stress and food scarcity. I couldn't be prouder to see Australia more than pulling its weight. I congratulate all the farmers and all the farm workers who have worked so hard to deliver these fantastic results. It's happening in all sorts of sectors. We know the industry has its challenges—

              . As I was just saying in answer to the last question, we know the agriculture sector has its challenges, and we're getting on with solving them. In the meantime, this data shows that the industry is in good shape, and that's a good thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              In terms of the supplementary question, we are in lock step with the agriculture sector's ambition to become a $100 billion industry by 2030. We are doing this by working with all players in the industry, not by dividing them and not by fighting against them. We are bringing people together, not hurling insults from the sidelines, when it comes to agriculture. That started with the industry roundtables I held in my first weeks as minister, and it continued at the Jobs and Skills Summit, where we agreed on measures to help the industry deal with workforce shortages right now.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am stunned. First it was the National Party getting stuck in about agriculture doing well, and now it's the Liberal Party getting stuck in about agriculture doing well. I thought you liked agriculture. I thought you liked rural communities. This is good news for the industry, and all you can do is yell.

                 When it was suggested that I could answer a question about the threats to agricultural productivity, I took the high road and I decided to not comment on the threats that sit over on the opposition. But now, with all this feedback I'm getting, maybe I'll have to drop the script and revise the answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It will come as no surprise that one of the major threats to the industry—this is serious—is the risk of exotic animal diseases entering the country from overseas. We've implemented a three-pronged approach to help protect industry by supporting Indonesia to deal with their outbreak, strengthening our borders and ensuring we are prepared should an outbreak occur. It's really good to see cattle prices at sales across the country beginning the rebound in spite of the fearmongering we saw from those opposite over the last couple of months.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Another serious threat is the impact that climate change is having on farming, as natural disasters are more fierce and more frequent. Supporting the sector to adapt and improve its climate resilience is imperative to our future food and fibre security.
