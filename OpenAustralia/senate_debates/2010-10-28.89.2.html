       <p>
        I rise to speak briefly on the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4421" rel="nofollow">
         Veterans’ Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010
        </a>
        . It is not my intention to delay the Senate for too long today. This bill makes a number of minor housekeeping amendments to legislation affecting our veterans and ex-service people. I note that this bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives in November last year and lapsed when the election was called. It has been pushed through the parliament in the first three sitting weeks of this new parliament, which will ensure that the measures in this bill benefit our veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        While not opposing this bill, the coalition expresses some concern about the measures to enable the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state Labor government to charge an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        levy on insurance policy holders in that state. The state Labor government is so cash-strapped it is now expecting ordinary insurance policy holders to pay for their reckless spending. This is indeed a great shame. I note that this legislation allows for other state governments to also tax insurance policy holders with SES levies without requiring additional legislative change by the federal parliament. Insurance based taxes and levies are grossly unfair. They penalise those who choose to look after themselves. In Victoria we have the fire services levy, and in regional Victoria this is a big issue. The New South Wales state coalition did not support the SES levy; nevertheless, the state Labor government rammed it through. I note that in the other place, when this was being debated, one person who, not surprisingly, was very keen on increasing taxes was the member for Corangamite,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Cheeseman" rel="nofollow">
         Darren Cheeseman
        </a>
        . He is well known for providing no support to the fishing industry. Darren Cheeseman is a great taxer of the people of Corangamite.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another measure in the bill, to extend coverage of the white card to eligible
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

        officers who worked at Maralinga in the 1980s, is a welcome step. It is a continuation of arrangements put in place by the previous coalition government for British nuclear test veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are six other measures in the bill, which include: extending the period in which claims for medical related travel expenses can be lodged with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, from three months to 12 months; a technical change to the way documents are served under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004; a change to enable injuries sustained before 30 June 2004 to continue to be covered by the

        taken prisoner after 1 July 2004; an alignment of the review and appeal processes between the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Specialist Medical Review Council; and, finally, minor amendments to the way lump sum payments are made under the MRC Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to say the coalition is not opposing this bill and I commend the bill to the Senate.

          Veterans’ Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010
         </a>
         will improve the support provided to our veterans, members and their dependants. The improved support includes giving veterans and service members more time to make claims for non-treatment related travel expenses. This involves extending from three to 12 months the time limit within which such claims must be lodged. Amendments in the bill will make it clear that, as intended, compensation will continue to be payable to eligible members where an initial war or defence caused injury or disease is aggravated or materially contributed to by service under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The bill will also ensure that the payment of a pension to the dependant of a veteran who was a prisoner of war will continue, as originally intended after the commencement of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other changes made by the bill will protect the interests of compensation recipients under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act by requiring that certain compensation payments be made to an account maintained in the compensation recipient’s name. The bill will also enable

         and decoration allowance recipients to receive both Victoria Cross or decoration allowances under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and a Victoria Cross or decoration allowance or annuity from a foreign country.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill will ensure that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Protective_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Protective Service
         </a>
         officers involved in patrolling the exclusion zone at Maralinga between 1984 and 1988 are covered by the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other changes in the bill will enable Defence Service Homes Insurance to contribute to the cost of providing emergency services in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         through the payment of a state emergency services levy. The levy will be collected from Defence Service Homes Insurance policy holders and remitted to the New South Wales government.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill includes minor changes to improve the operation of the Specialist Medical Review Council, firstly, by making it clear that the Specialist Medical Review Council may review a decision of the Repatriation Medical Authority not to amend a statement of principles; and, secondly, by enabling the Specialist Medical Review Council to review both versions of a statement of principles that relate to a particular condition, even if an applicant has requested a review of only one of the statements of principles.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, the bill will enable certain entities under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to specify the manner in which notices and other documents may be served. This will ensure that the legal effect of such notices and documents is protected.
        </p>
        <p>
         The changes made by the bill will enhance the services and support we provide to our current and former military personnel and their families.
