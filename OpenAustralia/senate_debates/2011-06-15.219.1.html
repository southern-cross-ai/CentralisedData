         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The total amount paid to Manpower Services (Australia) for the provision of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         recruiting services in the period 1 July to 31 December 2010 was $29.446 million.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Contract expenditure has significantly reduced in this period to $29.446 million from $53.482 million during the period 1 January to 30 June 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Contract expenditure in the previous period (1 January to 30 June 2010) was abnormally high largely as a result of the transition of the Recruiting Services contract from Chandler Macleod Group (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMG" rel="nofollow">
          CMG
         </a>
         ) to Manpower Services (Australia) (Manpower). CMG was paid $12.321 million for services to 1 February 2010, including costs associated with the resolution of contractual issues as part of the contract closure. Manpower Services (Australia) was paid $41.161 million for services from 1 February to 30 June 2010, including transition costs associated with the seven week contract transition period, which commenced in mid December 2009. In addition, Defence Force Recruiting usually recruits a higher number of recruits in the second six months of the financial year than in the first six months, primarily because of the January intakes for the

         and other recruit schools.
