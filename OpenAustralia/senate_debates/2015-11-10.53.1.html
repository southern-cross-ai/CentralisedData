         I thank Senator Canavan for his question and note his longstanding and keen interest in supporting the development of Australia's north. Senator Canavan would know well that unlocking the potential of the north is good news for the people of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         , north-western Australia and northern Queensland. It is a region that contributes over 11 per cent of our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         , over 40 per cent of the land mass and yet only five per cent of our population. So it is a particularly different demographic.
        </p>
        <p>
         In June this year the government released the first ever white paper on developing northern Australia, which is a blueprint for the long-term development of this region. At the heart of this initiative is a $5 billion concessional loan facility, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         Infrastructure Facility. This facility will provide up to $5 billion worth of concessional loans over five years, commencing in the 2016-17 financial year. Yesterday, Minister Frydenberg released a consultation paper to seek feedback on the proposed design and operation of the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. This is a significant milestone in this program, which will encourage and complement investment in northern Australian infrastructure. I have already had positive reports from those that attended the northern Australia showcase that Minister Robb has just hosted in my home town of Darwin. I understand that some of the world's most significant investors were there to explore opportunities for the development of northern Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         After many years in the wilderness, it must be so encouraging to so many residents across northern Australia to look forward to increased investment and activities in our communities. There really has never been a better time to be a resident of northern Australia.

            Northern Australia

           Infrastructure Facility will help fill the critical infrastructure gaps identified by the Northern Australia audit. Importantly, the facility has been designed in such a way that it will not crowd out private sector investment. The facility will act in partnership with private financiers and the governments of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory

            Western Australia
           </a>
           . The loans will help to build the economic capacity and longer term expansion of industry population in North Australia and deliver benefits to all Australians. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility will be able to provide more patient capital that allows for a project to reach maturity before being repaid. As a minister, and also as a senator for the Northern Territory, I can tell you that this is going to be a game changer for North Australia.

              agenda it will drive development and growth in northern Australia, including for those Indigenous people who live in the north. This government is committed to practical action to create more opportunities for Indigenous participation, and the white paper announces a range of measures to ensure that we include Indigenous people in this major investment in infrastructure. We have $20 million to support native title holders directly for the first time. And, for the first time, it will actually provide equity. So when a big developer comes and says they would like to go into some sort of partnership in the land, at least they will have capacity to be able to make a comprehensive response. There is $17 million to support secure property rights and township leasing and $12 million to expand opportunities for Indigenous ranger groups. On top of this, we are ensuring we include commitments for specific measurable targets for Indigenous employment and supply use because we on this side of the chamber recognise that the private sector must be part of the solution.
