        I would like to make a short statement about the fantastic event that was held with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and champion wrestler
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        last week. We were very lucky that the Hulk was able to donate his time and grant wishes for two very special children.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, I would like to make a few comments about the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The key mission of the Make-A-Wish Foundation is to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions, to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. Make-A-Wish began from very small roots in the United States. All his life, Christopher James Greicius dreamt of becoming a police officer. This wish was to become the inspiration for the largest wish-granting organisation in the world. In 1980, at the age of seven, young Chris was diagnosed with leukaemia. Upon learning that Chris’s most cherished wish was to be a policeman, members of the Arizona State Troopers began working to ensure his dream came true. They arranged for Chris to take a flight in a police helicopter and ride in a patrol car, and they presented him with his very own uniform. He was even sworn in as an honorary member of the force. Sadly, Chris passed away shortly afterwards, but the legacy of this first wish would be unprecedented. After attending Chris’s funeral, two of the state troopers reflected on the experience of making his dream come true. They thought that, if one boy’s wish could be granted, maybe the same could be done for other children. It was at this moment that the idea for Make-A-Wish was born.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1985 Make-A-Wish Australia was born and has since granted over 5,700 wishes to Australian children with life-threatening medical conditions. The foundation’s first wish was granted to 16-year-old Shawn Cleland of Footscray in Melbourne in 1985. An avid fan of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Shawn’s wish was to meet the players of his beloved Footscray. Shawn had never flown in a plane, so Make-A-Wish added an extra special touch, flying Shawn to Sydney to see the Bulldogs play the Swans. ‘Walking was my first choice of a wish,’ said Shawn, who was confined to a wheelchair due to his illness. His second was to play cricket for Australia or football for Footscray. Shawn’s favourite player, Footscray legend

        , paid him a visit before the trip. ‘Tell the team that if they get a thrashing they deserve a salary cut,’ Shawn joked.
       </p>
       <p>
        Make-A-Wish Australia is a national charity with over 1,000 volunteers and 57 branches. The national office is in Richmond, Victoria and there are also state corporate offices in Queensland,

        and Victoria. Make-A-Wish has over 30 affiliates world wide. All the money raised in Australia goes towards granting Wishes to Australian children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now in regards to last week’s event, I first have to pay a very special vote of thanks to Hulk Hogan, who drove down from Sydney with his fiance, Jennifer McDaniel, for the day so that he could take part. Hulk Hogan gave up his time and proved once again why he is a fantastic ambassador for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. You might be surprised to know that the Hulk is one of the most requested wishes in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
         USA
        </a>
        . He has a long history donating his time and money to this as well as many other charities and he was delighted to be able to grant some young Aussie children their wish of spending some time with him.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of those children is Tabitha Ellem. Tabitha is seven years old and suffers from a rare disorder known as Hurler’s disease that has required bone marrow transplants and chemotherapy. Despite her small stature, she is immediately the biggest presence in the room. Her personality is a delight to behold and the way she views life, despite her many challenges, should be an inspiration for the rest of us. Tabitha enjoys watching the wrestling on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        and impressed me, I must, say with her knowledge of the Hulk and his wrestling moves, which was second to none. I asked her, ‘Do you know what the Hulk does?’ She was in my office. Sitting there, she leant forward, pulled up her little arms and then started kissing her biceps. She really had it worked out.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dunn" rel="nofollow">

        is a bit older than Tabitha at 17, but he is no less an inspiration. He has been through hell recently, having undergone chemotherapy after being diagnosed with a brain tumour. This quiet and unassuming young man never seems to complain about his situation and I never saw him without a smile on his face that whole day. I know that he is about to be granted his wish to head to Switzerland in January for a much deserved break and ski trip. I want to take this opportunity to wish Mark and his family all the best.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just want to make a point here. While we are conscious of the challenges facing these children, we really need to take a moment to think about the way that having a sick child affects their family as well. I can only imagine the difficulties that must be faced by these children’s families. I want to acknowledge their efforts in this place as well and I hope that through foundations such as Make-A-Wish they, as well as their children, can enjoy some happiness and joy during difficult times.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge at this stage the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Make-A-Wish Australia, Sandy Brattstrom, who also attended on Thursday. She and the other volunteers who attended were an example to us all of how we can give back to the community by giving up our time for charitable causes such as Make-A-Wish. I encourage everyone to volunteer their time to charitable causes. To provide a moment of joy or happiness in another human being’s life will have a profound impact on you also. I can testify to that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must also at this point thank the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Childhood_Education" rel="nofollow">

        , Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Ellis" rel="nofollow">

        , as well as the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services,

        , who took the time to address the audience and strongly encourage donations to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now I have to seek some indulgence, as I profess that I am indeed a Hulkomaniac, even at my youthful 49. To have the one and only Hulk Hogan at Parliament House in the flesh was a great thrill for me, as I know it was for many of us here, including other members of parliament and the staff.

        has been a fantastic promoter for wrestling. I can still remember when my 19-year-old son, young Daniel, was a little fella sitting back together and watching the wrestling—only for his entertainment, of course. When the commercial break came in, I could guarantee London to a brick that there would be an opportunistic headlock or a punch in the side of the head. Much to the dismay of my wife, we still fancy our chances with each now and again, but I have to confess that I have to fight dirty now, as he is getting a little bit too strong for me.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I would really like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and members of Parliament House who turned out in large numbers last week—numbers that I am told we have not seen since that fateful time in 1975 in the old building. This was a joyous and happy occasion. The cans went around and I believe that we raised over $1,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. To everyone from all sides of politics and the staff, congratulations and thank you very much. Organisations such as Make-A-Wish deserve support from across the political spectrum and I hope that the parliament may continue this great relationship into the future.
