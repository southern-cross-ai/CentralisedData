        Preamble
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Joint
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing" rel="nofollow">
         Standing
        </a>
        Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration" rel="nofollow">
         Migration
        </a>
        ’s inquiry into temporary business visas titled
        <i>
         Temporary visas … permanent benefits: Ensuring the effectiveness, fairness and integrity of the temporary business visa program
        </i>
        . The report was tabled in Parliament on 12 September 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government agrees with the Committee that temporary skilled migrants are essential to meet current and future skills shortages in Australia and make a significant contribution to the Australian community. The Subclass 457 visa is the main temporary visa for skilled temporary workers. Many people on this visa apply for permanent residence through the employer sponsored migration visas. The employer sponsored visas, both temporary and permanent, provide a targeted response to skills shortages. These migration programs complement the government initiatives to increase the skills levels of Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        also agrees that it is important to restore public confidence and support for the Subclass 457 visa program. While most sponsors comply with the requirements for the Subclass 457 visa there is a small group that seeks to exploit or abuse the program. The Government introduced to the Parliament, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008 that strengthens the capacity to monitor sponsors, share information with other regulators and to take strong action against those who abuse the program, including pecuniary and other administrative sanctions. The Bill was enacted on 18 December 2008 and is to commence by mid September 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Training Australians and not just relying on the temporary employees from overseas is an important part of the Subclass 457 visa requirements, as discussed in the report. The training standards have not been clear in the past. The training requirement and ways in which it can be met and measured were considered in the reviews that the Government has instituted since taking office, especially the Skilled Migration Consultative Panel comprising representatives from state governments, unions and industry. The reviews also considered other key aspects of the Subclass 457 visa including adequate remuneration and regulations to prevent exploitation and undercut Australian working conditions.

        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The reports from the IDC and the Skilled Migration Consultative Panel brought together the issues raised in the reviews undertaken, including the findings and recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, for Government consideration of the long term reform of the 457 visa. The aim of the reform is to increase the effectiveness of the program, restore the integrity of the program and public confidence, ensure that it meets the skill needs to contribute to the Australian community, and, using a risk based approach, provide fast processing for genuine sponsors and strong actions against those who may attempt to exploit or abuse the program. The report was presented to Ministers on 19 December 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is grateful for the work the Committee has taken in respect to this important subject and for all those who contributed with their submissions and evidence to the Committee.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government’s response to the recommendations made by the Committee follows. A number of the recommendations have already been implemented. Others will be announced following the Government consideration of the reviews and consultations. The delay in responding to the Committee’s report has been due, in part, to the number of changes to the Subclass 457 visa program that were being considered and implemented in 2008.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         The Government notes this recommendation.

        The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        ) is the competent authority which conducts national security assessments on visa applicants. ASIO assess visa applicants referred by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) as per the requirements of Public Interest Criteria 4002 (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC" rel="nofollow">
         PIC
        </a>
        4002) under the Migration Regulations 1994. At the completion of a security assessment, ASIO provides advice to DIAC as to whether the applicant is assessed as a direct or indirect risk to security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The character requirement of the 457 visa program is detailed in Public Interest Criterion 4001 (PIC 4001) of the Migration Regulations. The Australian Federal Police (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP

        ) is not a direct stakeholder in these requirements. Under current processing arrangements, Subclass 457 visa applicants are not required to provide police clearances except in situations where they have declared a previous criminal history in their application.

         Recommendation 2
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship commission research into sectoral usage of the 457 visa program, commencing with the meat processing sector, with a view to further refining temporary skilled migration policy and the 457 visa program with reference to specific industry sector needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         The Government supports this recommendation.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The specific needs of some industries warrant the development of Labour Agreements. Labour Agreements allow the Australian Government to stipulate certain requirements relating to the recruitment of overseas workers, which may not be applicable under the standard Subclass 457 visa program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2006-07, the Commonwealth and the Australian Meat Industry Council negotiated a Meat Industry Labour Agreement that enables meat processing companies to regularise the status of existing overseas meatworkers on Subclass 457 visas where they can demonstrate the skills are not readily available in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Changes to the Migration Regulations introduced on 10 September 2007 have made the Labour Agreement the only pathway available to access overseas meat workers under the Subclass 457 visa program. These changes have received some criticism from the industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This approach was extended to the on-hire industry. On 1 October 2007, access to the standard Subclass 457 visa program was removed for on-hire employers that seek to place overseas workers with other unrelated businesses. A Labour Agreement is now the compulsory pathway for access to overseas workers for the on-hire industry. The agreement provides checks and balances to assist in managing prevalent practices such as ‘benching’ (not paying salary between contracts) and the underpayment of workers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further analysis of sectorial usage of the Subclass 457 visa program, and the suitability of certain industries to access a Labour Agreement, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

        Occupations eligible for various visas are based on the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO) and, in the future will be based on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO).

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship can amend by legislative instrument, the list of eligible occupations in response to changing demands and when new occupations are to be included in the program due to a skills shortage or when existing occupations are to be excluded due to an oversupply in the labour market.
