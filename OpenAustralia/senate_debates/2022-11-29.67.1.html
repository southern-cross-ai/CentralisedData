        What a day for historic wins it was on Saturday! Not only did the Andrews Labor government secure a third term in Victoria but of course our Socceroos made World Cup history. For the first time in 12 years, the Socceroos won a game at the

        World Cup. It's been 12 long years between victories, and it was incredible to watch. It was our first clean sheet at a World Cup since 1974. It was an exciting game, as the scenes that we saw in

        It was a game that allowed some of our very best talent from all across the country to shine, but I want to make special mention of Maty Ryan, our captain, and Milos Degenek,

        â€”fellow Westfield Sports High alumni. I ended up in the Senate. They ended up at the World Cup. I think they got the better deal! I also want to acknowledge big Harry's 86th-minute save against Tunisia. He cemented his place as a legend in our game with that split-second decision. This was in only his third senior match since he ruptured his

        To the Socceroos: you united a nation across the other side of the world. As for what is next, I know that I will be up at 2 am this Thursday to watch our Socceroos play Denmark. If my colleagues could take that into account while we are sitting, I would appreciate it greatly! Thank you so much to
