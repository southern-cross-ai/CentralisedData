        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Senator Watt. Last week, many school students skipped class to attend School Strike for Palestine protests, which Jewish community leaders warned would fuel division and antisemitism.
       </p>
       <p>
        As predicted by Jewish community leaders, antisemitic signs and slogans were ultimately displayed at these protests. Minister, what action did the Albanese government take prior to these protests to discourage attendance and encourage children to remain in school?

         Thank you, Senator Henderson. I actually saw Minister Clare deal with this matter—I think it was in question time—in the House of Representatives, where he made very clear that his expectation, as the Minister for Education, is that students should be at school during school hours. He did that in probably the most public forum we have in this country. Ultimately, decisions about the operation of schools are matters for state and territory governments and the non-government school sector, but the minister's position on this was utterly clear.
        </p>
        <p>
         More broadly, what we have also said is that we think it's important that all of these matters be put in a non-partisan and non-inflammatory manner. I'd encourage all senators, in approaching and discussing these issues, to recognise that there are members in all parts of our community who are extremely upset about the events that are going on at the moment. Of course, we recognise that the Jewish community is going through great pain in our community at the moment, as a result of events in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . Equally, members of our Islamic communities are going through great pain as well. I'd encourage all senators, again, to consider that in terms of their public contributions on this topic.

           Minister, with reports of antisemitism rising across the world and, tragically, also in Australia, what steps is the Albanese government taking to actively counter antisemitic material which targets young people and school students?

            Senator Henderson, again, I would make the point that, unfortunately, we are seeing antisemitism on the rise in our community and right across the world at the moment, as we are also seeing Islamophobia increasing and on the rise across the community. I think it is important that all Australian politicians recognise that both of these things are occurring, that both are wrong and that both need to be condemned. Antisemitism needs to be condemned in the strongest possible terms, as does Islamophobia.

               That's precisely why I was making the point that we need to recognise that antisemitism is abhorrent and that Islamophobia is abhorrent in our communities, and both need to be condemned. That's why the Australian government has developed a social cohesion package to support Australian communities affected by the ongoing conflict, including a $25 million grant to the
