       <p>
        Senator McLucas, in her first question today, asked me a question in relation to the John Cani Estate Aged Hostel in Queensland, and I undertook to seek some information in relation to the senator’s question. I am able to inform the Senate of the following. On 11 January 2006 the department imposed sanctions on the Roman Catholic Trust Corporation for the Diocese of Rockhampton—the approved provider of John Cani Estate Aged Hostel. It is disappointing that the provider had allowed care to be compromised to the extent that the department found it necessary to impose sanctions. Under the sanctions, the approved provider has appointed an adviser with nursing experience who is implementing an improvement plan to address the areas of noncompliance. Also, for a period of three months, the approved provider will not be able to admit new high-care residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this case, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency identified serious issues in relation to management and resident care. The agency has advised the department that the serious risk has been mitigated and that the approved provider is continuing to address the remaining areas of noncompliance. The sanctions will assist and encourage the approved provider to improve the delivery of care and services to existing residents at the home. The department has written to residents and relatives informing them of the situation. The approved provider has held a meeting of residents and relatives to discuss the issues at the home and the action being taken to address the issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have previously advised the Senate, the Australian government has in place a quality framework to identify and quickly deal with issues that may affect the health, safety and wellbeing of residents. The framework includes the complaints resolutions scheme and accreditation and compliance action under the Aged Care Act 1997. The system ensures that any information received by the department is reviewed, assessed and then referred for appropriate action. The department and the agency, I can assure the Senate, will continue to monitor the home—in fact they are doing that as we speak. The care and safety of residents of all aged care homes remain the highest priorities.
