        Leave granted.

        The speech read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I rise to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill proposes to rectify some unintended consequences of two sets of major health sector reforms implemented by the government earlier this year—the private health insurance reforms, which commenced on 1 April 2007, and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme reforms, the first tranche of which came into effect on 1 August 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor supported the original legislation in these two areas, with some amendments, and we will support this Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is disappointing, however, that we are having to revisit and correct aspects of these reforms so quickly. These two legislative packages were important, complex changes to two key areas of health policy, and the Parliament dealt with both of them in a fairly rushed environment, as I recall. The fact that we are revisiting them again so soon after their respective commencements points to poor management of detail by the Minister for Health when implementing major changes to the health sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That we are here having to fix up legislation so recently passed really does smack of a Minister and a Government who have stopped paying attention to the detail of governing; a clear sign that the Minister did not take the care and attention that was needed in first introducing these bills and did not allow for the processes to run for sufficient time—for example, in the Senate Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Perhaps the Minister and his colleagues should be spending a little less time worrying about the Government’s re-election and a tad more time actually governing. Though, of course, the Minister for Health is on the record saying that he is not interested in anything that does not involve the election, so it is no great surprise to us that we are here again fixing up his mess.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Turning to the detail of the Bill before us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 1 proposes amendments to the private health insurance reforms which commenced on 1 April 2007. These amendments relate most particularly to the arrangements affecting overseas visitors such as tourists, 457 visa holders or overseas students.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To recap on the original legislation, the reforms enacted earlier this year—the Private Health Insurance Bill 2006 and six related bills—introduced a range of reforms to the private health insurance arrangements that included allowing for private health insurers to offer a wider range of products, standardised information about health insurance products, changes to Lifetime Health Cover, changes to prudential arrangements and changes to the role of the regulator—the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC). Under the new arrangements, emphasis shifted from the regulation of health funds to the regulation of health insurance products. In addition, various transitional arrangements were introduced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reforms included changes that meant that from 1 July 2008 overseas visitors’ health cover would become a general insurance product that could be offered by general insurers and private health funds. Under the new arrangements, overseas visitors’ health cover would not be subjected to the complying health insurance product arrangements established by PHIAC and would not be subject to the community rating arrangements which require insurers to offer products without discrimination on the basis of age, profile, medical history or other risk factors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These arrangements created an inequity between general insurers and private health insurers. While general insurers are not subject to the requirement of the community rating arrangements and can therefore operate in a risk-rating environment—where they can charge higher premiums or refuse cover altogether based on a person’s risk profile—private health insurers who are offering complying health insurance products were bound under PHIAC to community rating requirements. This potentially placed an unfair burden on the private health funds because private health funds were required to accept risks that their competitors in this particular market—the general insurers—could refuse.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Correcting this potential inequity appears to be the reasoning behind most of the Schedule 1 amendments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Health Minister
        </a>
        ’s second reading speech: “
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Act" rel="nofollow">
         The Act
        </a>
        currently provides that all the operational rules of a private health insurer are subject to improper discrimination requirements. However, it was only intended that these requirements apply to the core business of private health insurers—that is, complying health insurance products. The Bill will provide that the improper discrimination requirements only apply to complying health insurance products.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A second set of amendments concerns the regulatory environment for overseas visitors’ health cover. The government’s intention under the original reform package was to make the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Prudential_Regulation_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Prudential Regulation Authority
        </a>
        , or APRA, the regulator for all overseas visitors’ health cover from 1 July 2008 as a general insurance product.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        According to the Health Minister’s second reading speech, however, the government has now decided that from July 2008 overseas visitors’ cover offered by private health insurers will be regulated as a health related business by PHIAC, while cover provided by the general insurers will be regulated as a general insurance business by APRA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The explanatory memorandum provides no information indicating the rationale for this regulatory change. The only explanation offered by the Minister in his second reading speech is that the decision was made after consultation with APRA and PHIAC and that: “This parallel approach will remove the potential for regulatory overlap and minimise the compliance burdens on health insurers who now offer the service, while not preventing potential new providers from entering the market.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments will remove the requirement that health funds who offer overseas visitors’ health cover during the transition period from 1 April 2007 to 30 June 2008 must offer it as a complying health insurance product. In essence, this means that insurers can offer products to travellers that do not provide the full or same cover as that offered to residents. It also means that health insurers and general insurers will be treated consistently in providing these products to travellers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Penalties for not offering this as a complying health insurance product will also be removed, retrospective to 1 April 2007. We understand from the Australian Health Insurance Association that the private health insurance industry is generally in favour of these amendments and in fact has been trying to have a number of the minor issues fixed in this fashion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As I indicated at the outset, we will support these amendments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Turning to Schedule 2, these amendments concern the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        reforms which came into effect on 1 August 2007. To recap, in May 2007 a Bill amending the pharmaceutical provisions of the National Health Act was introduced into the House of Representatives. Subsequently, the Bill was passed by the Senate and came into effect on 1 August 2007. The legislation introduced significant structural changes to the pricing of medicines subsidized under the PBS and was the subject of a Senate Committee inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments in this Bill propose to clarify and correct provisions in the recent reform package that affect the pharmaceutical benefits around pharmacists: firstly, supplying substituted brands of prescribed medicines; secondly, supplying repeats of medicines; and, thirdly, supplying medicines early.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Prior to the implementation of the new legislation in August 2007, pharmacists could substitute an equivalent brand under the early supply arrangements. However, the reforms introduced in August inadvertently narrowed the definition under the early supply provision so that pharmacists could no longer substitute different brands. This Bill proposes allowing the substitution of different brands under the early supply arrangements, provided the brands are described as equivalent in the schedule.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In essence, the changes here ensure that pharmacists can continue to substitute in the way they did prior to the changes as well as in the new ways that will be encouraged by the major reforms of earlier this year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let me deal briefly with those three different areas. In relation to substitution arrangements, under brand substitution arrangements
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        pharmacists are allowed to substitute to the lowest priced approved bioequivalent generic product with the permission of the patient and provided the prescriber has not directed otherwise on the prescription. The government subsidises only to the lowest priced drug in the defined subgroup and consumers pay any difference in price in addition to the usual co-payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill clarifies that a prescriber does not need to specify the exact brand of medicine when writing the prescription. A prescription will be valid even if the brand is not specified, although a listed drug and its dosage or form must be specified. The Bill further proposes restricting substitution arrangements to only those medicines specified in the schedule so that pharmacy prepared medicines do not qualify as substitutes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In respect of repeats, the Bill proposes applying permissible repeat prescription arrangements to schedule equivalent medicines. Under PBS arrangements, a prescription can specify a number of repeats so that the patient does not need to return to their doctor to obtain a new prescription every time they complete a course of medicine. The maximum number of repeats for a subsidised medicine is specified in the schedule.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed amendments prevent the number of permissible repeats being exceeded by prescribing more than one schedule equivalent medicine in a prescription.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, on the early supply provisions: under the PBS arrangements, when a patient has a repeat prescription for a PBS medicine they normally cannot obtain repeat scripts until 20 days after the supply of the original prescription. This is designed to prevent stockpiling of medicines. However, in special circumstances, the patient can obtain a script early or immediately under the immediate supply provisions of the PBS—for example, if the original medication is lost or damaged. These early supply prescriptions do not count towards the PBS safety net.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We understand that industry groups have been consulted on these amendments concerning the PBS reform. While the Generic Medicines Industry Association have expressed their support for the amendments, we understand that Medicines Australia has questioned the need for these reforms. As my colleague the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Shadow Minister
        </a>
        for Health flagged in the other place, we understand that Medicines Australia has flagged some additional recommendations regarding the need for the Minister to seek
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
         Therapeutic Goods Administration
        </a>
        advice before something is declared bioequivalent, and Labor have requested clarification from the Minister or departmental officials about where this stands.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government amendments to this Bill were belatedly provided to Labor on Tuesday evening, just prior to debate on the Bill in the House. The amendments will allow members of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council (PHIAC) to more flexibly manage the practical workings of the Council.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The current provisions, which came into effect with the new raft of private health insurance in April, require members of the Council who are insured by a particular health insurer to excuse themselves from discussions when matters arise regarding their health insurers. PHIAC is a 6 member Council and each of the members own private health insurance. We understand from the Council that just owning an insurance policy under the current legislation would require the individual Council members to regularly excuse themselves from Council deliberations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments we are considering here rectify the inadvertent consequences of the April amendments by allowing for the Council itself to determine whether any of its members should excuse themselves from Council discussions. Controls are maintained, with the Board and the Minister able to intervene where it is deemed necessary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the extraordinarily short time frame we were given to consider these amendments, consultation with PHIAC and stakeholders was not possible before this Bill was debated in the other place. My colleague the Shadow Minister for Health flagged in the House that our support of these amendments was conditional on further consultation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have subsequently been able to discuss the amendments with the Council, who have confirmed that these changes were initiated on their request. We have also consulted with the Australian Health Insurance Association about the amendments, and although they had no time to canvas their members, the executive was of the view that the changes seemed eminently sensible.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So I will conclude now by saying that Labor supports all three sets of amendments in this Bill and that we hope there will be no need for the Parliament to again revisit either the reform packages for the Private Health Insurance or Pharmaceutical Benefit Schedule.
