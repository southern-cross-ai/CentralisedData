       </p>
       <p>
        I thank you for the opportunity to speak today on this important motion. It does a number of things in terms of progressing the

        report and in terms of endorsing the draft behaviour standards and codes, as recommended by the joint select committee report, whilst the formal and final enforcement and advisory regime is put in place. We also have the annual report of the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce. We acknowledge the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        S. It also meets the recommendation of the

        <i>

        </i>
        report to have an annual discussion about behaviour and standards in Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twelve months ago this parliament committed to implementing the
        <i>
         Set the
        </i>
        <i>
         standard
        </i>
        report and set out a road map for how we could lead the nation in workplace standards rather than lag behind. On this day last year the parliament acknowledged that we had a problem. We did not meet the expectations of the community, the staff who worked here and the parliamentarians who call this place their home away from home. It was a tough day for a lot of people but an important one.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason we could have that conversation was due to the bravery of a number of current and former staff, in particular, who were willing to speak about their experiences in this place. The problems the report identified brought to light what had been a lived experience for too many for too long: gender inequality, with a lack of women in senior roles; a lack of accountability in systems for those who wanted to report misconduct, including appropriate redress; the 'work hard, play hard' culture at Parliament House, which had left some, particularly young women, vulnerable to exploitation and sexual assault; and high levels of power and discretion in relation to employment, combined with insecure employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were 28 recommendations in the report and we adopted all of them, as did the former coalition government. The Labor government has continued the approach that began this time last year to work across the parliament to put in place the changes that are needed and to improve the experience of all who work here and across Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. We have achieved some significant progress in implementing the reforms. Six recommendations have been implemented, four have been partially implemented, and 17 are in progress and ongoing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The completed work includes the establishment of Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce, and I acknowledge those senators who have worked with me on that: Senator Farrell, Senator Hume, Senator Birmingham who has also played a significant role, and Senator Waters. We have tried to agree on issues across the parliament, which isn't always easy, but I want to thank my colleagues for engaging in good faith in this process. This work included support for the creation of the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR" rel="nofollow">
         HR
        </a>
        entity and enhanced Parliamentary Workplace Support Service. The Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Standards has delivered a road map for the behavioural codes and standards which we will consider as part of this motion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Government has completed a review of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOP" rel="nofollow">
         MOP
        </a>
        (S) Act and accepted in principle all 15 recommendations. We've passed protections against age and disability discrimination, and parliament has changed its standing orders to try and facilitate more family-friendly hours.

        also at this point thank you Kerri Hartland, who was the independent chair of the inaugural Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce but who has moved on to other roles. She took on the job of chairing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLT" rel="nofollow">
         PLT
        </a>
        , which has the significant challenge of trying to corral parliamentarians of all walks and parties across this place. The PLT is in the final process of appointing an independent chair to fill the vacancy left by Kerri Hartland, and I acknowledge the work she put in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the next 12 months the government will progress, in consultations across the parliament, two of the most significant reforms in the review: the passage of legislation to enshrine the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service as the independent HR entity, which will ensure that parliamentarians and staff can access arms-length and fit-for-purpose advice and training in relation to workplace matters. This motion today appropriately acknowledges the role the PWS is already playing across our workplaces, and thank you to Meg Brighton and her team for establishing such a professional and respected service. We have also ahead of us the establishment of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission to support an investigation and compliance regime for the codes of conduct. Getting this structure right will be very important as it will be an enduring feature of many parliaments that come after us. Working across the parliament to get this right is an ambition of the government and is shared by all members of the PLT.
       </p>
       <p>
        Parliament House is a unique workplace. We want to attract the best and brightest here and we want them to have an enriching and fulfilling experience. Thank you to our staff for your involvement in this work and for all that you do. I truly hope that you have seen improvements in your workplace over the past 12 months. We want to ensure that staff don't work in a grey zone where they have no clear guidance about standards and expectations. It can be hard to work in our offices in this place and also in electorate offices, which can be an isolating experience for some. We have a shared responsibility to make sure people who work in this building and in other political offices are able to do their job in a safe way and where they are confident that the systems and supports are there when and if they need them. This remains our ongoing task to guide us and ensure that we deliver on it.
