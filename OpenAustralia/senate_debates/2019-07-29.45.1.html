        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Birmingham. I refer to Minister Taylor's claim that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC
        </a>
        listing affecting his own interests had the potential to affect 'thousands of farmers in his electorate'. Can the minister confirm that there is only one compliance case under investigation in the region?

         I would refer the honourable senator to the statement given by the member for Hume in the House earlier today, in which he steps through the representations he received in 2016 and 2017 and from farmers across his electorate and he steps through the communications he had with representative bodies of farmers as well, all of whom are outlining their concerns around this issue, and in outlining their concerns—

           I'm well aware that the minister is trying to step through an awful lot at the moment, but the reality is that my question asked whether there was one compliance case under investigation in the region, and the minister has gone nowhere near that. In fact, he looks like he's going on a ramble in response to the minister's statement, not my question.

             I'd also point out to the senator the statement that the member for Hume made. He's been clear, as he has on multiple occasions, that he has not engaged in discussions regarding compliance actions. What he has done is represent his electorate in relation to matters that have been brought to his—

               The point of order is direct relevance. The question doesn't go to what the minister did. It is a question of this minister in representing the portfolio to confirm whether there is only one compliance case under investigation in the region. That is the only question.

                You've restated the question, Senator Wong. I am listening very carefully. The minister's been speaking for 45 seconds. He is allowed to address the preamble as well. I'm listening carefully to ensure that something is directly relevant to part of the question. So, I'll call the minister to continue. He's now been reminded of it twice, by you and by Senator
