         I thank Senator Bragg for the question. As we have done throughout the entire pandemic, the Morrison government has acted quickly but cautiously to protect the livelihoods and lives of Australians. On 28 November the minister for health signed a biosecurity determination preventing people who have been in an omicron high-risk country in the previous 14 days from entering Australia unless they are Australian citizens, permanent residents or immediate family members of a citizen or are otherwise exempt. Omicron high-risk countries for this determination are the eight southern African countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
          South Africa
         </a>
         and Zimbabwe. Direct flights from these countries will not be permitted until 12 December. In addition, and based on the advice of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Medical Officer
         </a>
         of Australia, the national security committee of cabinet has taken the necessary and temporary decision to pause the next step to safely reopen Australia to vaccinated visa-holders, including skilled and student cohorts, until 15 December. This includes the reopening to Japan and Korea. This temporary pause will ensure Australia can gather the information we need to better understand the omicron variant, including the efficacy of the vaccine; the range of illness, including whether it may generate more mild symptoms; and the level of transmission. As is the case currently, all persons entering Australia must make an Australia Travel Declaration before they arrive. Again, on behalf of the government, I can assure all Australians we are taking the cautious approach we have had throughout the pandemic to protect the lives and livelihoods of Australians.

            The strong measures that we took at the start of the pandemic have ensured that we fared better than most countries in dealing with COVID-19. The closure of the border to China was a significant step that allowed us to continue protecting Australia lives and livelihoods. Over 12 percent of people in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
             USA
            </a>
            and 11 percent of people in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
             UK
            </a>
            have had COVID-19. When you contrast that to Australia, 0.4 percent of Australians have had COVID-19. Of the 38 developed
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
             OECD
            </a>
            countries, Australia has had the second-lowest number of COVID-19 cases on a per capita basis and, again on a per capita basis, the UK and the USA have had over 40 times the number of COVID deaths compared to Australia. By avoiding the death rates of OECD countries we have saved, as Australians, around 30,000 lives.

               As the Leader of the Government in the Senate has said, the best way for each and every Australian to protect themselves—not just themselves but their family and their community—is to get vaccinated. Without a doubt, again, as the leader of the government has pointed out today, we have done an amazing job as Australians. We have now some of the highest vaccination rates in the world and, of that, we can all be incredibly proud. Australia now has the equal 10th highest with Norway first-dose vaccination rate in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
                OECD
               </a>
               . Australia's full vaccination rate is ranked 14th highest.
              </p>
              <p>
               We know that vaccination against COVID-19 reduces the risk of the virus. While, at this point in time, we don't know about the new variant, vaccination will continue to protect us. We can again be confident we will emerge on the other side.
