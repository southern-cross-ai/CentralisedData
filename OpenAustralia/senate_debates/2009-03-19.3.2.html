         The Committee
        </a>
        ’s consideration of these Guidelines has raised the following issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Appendix 2A to these Guidelines specifies the conditions that apply to a Commercialisation Training Scheme grant. Clause 7 deals with rights of access to the premises and records of a grant recipient. Subclause 7.1 states that access must be given to certain prescribed officers, including “any person authorised in writing by the Secretary”. This appears to be a wide discretion. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to the need for this wide power and whether it should be restricted to persons of suitable seniority and experience.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subclause 6.3 in Appendix 2A states that the Commonwealth’s right to be indemnified is “in addition to, and not exclusive of” any other right, power or remedy provided by law. The words “not exclusive of” are, presumably, intended to mean “does not exclude”, rather than implying that the Commonwealth’s right is inclusive of other rights. The Committee seeks your advice as to whether this wording should be corrected to avoid any ambiguity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 6 March 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Guidelines. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room

        Dear Senator Wortley
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 5 February 2009 concerning the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances’ consideration of the Other Grants Guidelines (Research) 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I agree that the provisions of sub-clause 7.1 are wide, but I believe this is necessary for my Department to fully meet its fiduciary duties in relation to the Commercialisation Training Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTS" rel="nofollow">
         CTS
        </a>
        ). The access provisions contained in clause 7 identify those officers with a clearly defined statutory or program management role in relation to the administration of the CTS. However, my Department may occasionally need to rely on the skills of individuals or organisations that cannot easily be identified in advance. For example, an audit of data returns required under the CTS conditions of grant may require the engagement of a private audit firm or information technology specialist.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In such circumstances, I believe that it is necessary for the Secretary to be able to source appropriate expertise and to ensure access to information as appropriate. In this case, sub-clause 7.1 allows these individuals or classes of individuals to be authorised at the discretion of the Secretary. I can assure you that the Secretary will ensure appropriate consideration of the skill sets required at the time in order to guarantee that only persons of suitable seniority and experience are authorised under this sub-clause.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to the indemnity provisions in sub-clause 6.3, you correctly identified that within the phrase “in addition to, and not exclusive of”, the expression “not exclusive of” is intended to mean “does not exclude”. I understand that “in addition to, and not exclusive of,” is in relatively common use in Commonwealth agreements, however, I accept your view that a more direct expression would present less opportunity for confusion. My Department operates on an annual cycle that provides for review and amendment of guidelines each year subsequent to each year’s budget and I propose that this issue be corrected through the next amendment to the guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I trust that this information is of assistance to the committee. Thank you for seeking my views on these matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yours sincerely

        This Determination specifies automotive and other industry assistance programs for the purposes of the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. Section 17 of the
        <i>
         Legislative Instruments Act 2003
        </i>
        directs a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken particularly where a proposed instrument is likely to have an effect on business. Section 18 of the Act provides that in some circumstances consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate. The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Act requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken. The Explanatory Statement that accompanies this Determination makes no reference to consultation. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation.

        </a>
        ). The ADI must then comply with monitoring and risk-control requirements in relation to the deemed related entity. This appears to be a widely-framed discretion. There is no indication as to the circumstances under which this discretion will be exercised and whether there is prior consultation with an ADI.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Clause 35 requires an ADI to consult with APRA prior to certain events (eg establishing or acquiring a subsidiary). It is not clear whether this clause operates simply as a method of notification, or whether APRA approval is required before the stipulated events.

The Committee has written to the Minister seeking further explanation about the nature of this limited consultation.

         Social Security (Administration) (Schooling Requirement) Determination 2009 (No. 1)

        This Determination specifies matters relevant to a decision regarding the suspension of a person’s schooling requirement payment.

        Part 1 of Schedule 1 to this Determination lists reasonable excuses for failing to comply with an enrolment notice. Item 5 of Part 1 provides that it is an excuse if “the person has a reasonable belief that no school at which the child may reasonably be enrolled can provide a safe environment”. Paragraph 6(1)(b) of the Determination states that the Secretary may determine that this is a reasonable excuse if the excuse is reasonable in the circumstances. It thus appears that the Secretary must determine whether a reasonable belief is reasonable in the circumstances. The reason for the imposition of a double requirement of reasonableness is unclear.

        Part 2 of Schedule 1 lists reasonable excuses for failing to comply with an attendance notice. Item 2 of Part 2 provides that it is an excuse if “the school … cannot provide a safe environment”. This is not framed as a reasonable belief, in contrast to Item 5 of Part 1. The explanatory statement provides no indication of the reasons for the difference in drafting.
