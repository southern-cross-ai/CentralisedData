        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I ask whether the minister can confirm that the Prime Minister made the following statement last week in his courtyard, and I quote:

In the courtyard, the Prime Minister gave a media conference and, during the course of that conference, he indicated the debt trajectory that the former finance minister left this country and the coalition to fix up to protect future generations. The debt trajectory that Senator Wong and her colleagues had the Australian budget on would have seen a debt trajectory way above that which we are now looking at. It was in that context that he said that a substantial decline from Labor's trajectory to what it current is—

            Seeking to pick out a few words from a general statement or from a paragraph is as disingenuous as you can get. A party that told the Australian people that the deficit in their last budget would be $18 billion, which blew out to $48 billion, now trying to lecture us as to good economic stewardship is absolutely unacceptable from our point of view.

               We know the games that those opposite play in trying to pick out a few words in relation to a whole host of words, taking them out of context and then trying to spin them in a manner that would misrepresent that which was being asserted. So just as Mr Shorten said that 2015 would be the year of ideas, does not mean Labor has never had any ideas.

                   will speak for itself as to what the Prime Minister said. And, if it needs correction, I am sure the Prime Minister's office will deal with it. I do not know what the Prime Minister said yesterday but, if it was said in the House, I have no doubt that

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the Prime Minister's claim yesterday 'I never said that. I never said that.' as honest as his claim before the election that there would be 'no cuts to education; no cuts to health; no changes to the pension; no changes to the

                     That question comes from the former minister and her party that promised the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax; from a government that promised that they would turn back the boats and then never did! Senator Wong, who promised a budget deficit of $18 billion and then let it blow out to $48 billion, hardly has any credibility in this space.
