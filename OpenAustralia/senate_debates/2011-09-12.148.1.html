                 I was just saying I know that Senator Sterle has a deep interest in this area. While the government is working generally on employment and, as Senator Wong said earlier in an answer, 140,000 jobs have been created and people are able to put food on the table and shelter over their families, we are also ensuring that work is done with Indigenous employment. We are working to close the gap, creating and sustaining 100,000 jobs out to 2018. This is difficult work. While the majority of the work that will be done by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Services_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  Job Services Australia
                 </a>
                 providers will be done under the Indigenous Employment Program, we have identified that we need to work with young

                  Indigenous Australians
                 </a>
                 while they are still at school, making sure that young Indigenous students have a pathway into employment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In 2010 we established the Learn Earn Legend! program. It is a program based on keeping young Indigenous students in school, giving them an opportunity to learn but, at the same time as that, ensuring they get that pathway to employment. We are working with national sporting organisations, with education providers and also with Indigenous communities themselves. We are making progress. The

                 </a>
                 have set up the first of the programs. In 2010, 131 students took part in the program. So far, 84 per cent have gone on to jobs, further training or higher education. Currently there are 188 students in that program. The

                   Of the 41 students, 85 per cent are going on to jobs. So this is not training for training's sake. This is not training so people have certificates they can put up on their walls. This is training that leads to genuine employment, genuine jobs. This is where the government is investing its funds in the school area, making sure that—

                      Liberal senators may want to make fun of this, but it is an important issue and it is certainly making a change to many people's lives. In the last budget we provided $50.7 million over four years to support 6,400 Indigenous school based traineeships. These traineeships will predominantly support students in years 11 and 12, providing them with real work experience, real mentoring and real support moving forward into employment. Students are working with employers and small business. At the same time as that, the program provides them with the opportunity to make that jump into employment, and that is exactly why this program is in place. The support for mentoring, though, does not start in year 11 and 12; it starts in year 7. Funding has been put forward to support students in year 7 so they can make progress—

                        We are fortunate enough in this parliament to have 100 young Indigenous students from across the country who have come to Canberra to spend the week working with members of parliament, ministers and parliamentary secretaries but also with government departments. On behalf of everyone involved, I welcome the students to Canberra and welcome the students to the week. I also thank the large number of parliamentarians, both senators and MPs, who were involved in the program. We have gone up from around 75 to over 90 MPs. Certainly the program was extremely successful over the last year and has now been increased in size. The important thing is that there are jobs in government departments, graduate traineeships and scholarships, and we want to make sure that young

                        understand the jobs are there and get the opportunities to get access to those jobs. That is why this program is so important. I thank all the parliamentarians for their support.
