        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer and the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change

         Energy Efficiency
        </a>
        , Senator Wong. Does the minister accept that it was utterly contemptuous for the government to last week task a committee with reviewing the merits of their carbon tax legislation and on Sunday start selectively quoting from updated Treasury modelling into the impact of this carbon tax but only release the modelling minutes before the committee was due to start questioning Treasury officials about it this morning? How can the government claim to want a thorough and considered scrutiny of its proposals when it treats a committee that it established and that it set the hearing dates for with such complete contempt?

             may say, what is utterly contemptuous in this debate is the continued reliance on falsehoods from those opposite in relation to the impact of pricing carbon. What is contemptuous is the lack of regard for the science and the lack of regard for the truth that has been demonstrated in, and is central to, the fear campaign engaged in by those opposite. What is utterly contemptuous is the man who wants to be the Prime Minister of this country going out to different sites to get a good camera shot and telling—

                       In relation to the modelling, as the senator would know if he has read it, it shows almost no difference from the modelling that was previously released. It shows that the economy continues to grow. It shows that jobs continue to grow. It shows that incomes continue to grow and that domestic emissions will fall to nearly half of what they would be without carbon pricing in 2050. These are all findings that I am sure the opposition will continue to ignore.

                         , I ask a supplementary question. Speaking of falsehoods, I refer the minister to this updated modelling and the assumption and all the modelled scenarios within it that 'Australia introduces a domestic carbon price in a world where other countries also act to mitigate climate change'. Does the government believe that other countries, particularly the United States and China, have policies in place that will ensure they comply with this assumption? If not, how quickly will they have such policies in place?

                             , I ask a further supplementary question. In the four scenarios modelled by the government, why has the government not modelled at least one scenario where other countries do not meet the government's optimistic outlook for international action? Given that

                             recently shelved a tightening of smog standards which would have lowered emissions, isn't it the case that not only are other countries backtracking on pricing emissions but they also backtracking on reducing emissions? Isn't Labor's policy just leaving Australia like a shag on a rock?

Thank you for bringing the minister to order before I have raised the point, but I continue the point that this minister is a serial offender. Every question she is asked, because she cannot answer it, she attacks the questioner or gives a commentary on the questioner and other people from this side. Can you bring her to order permanently, not just for this question?
