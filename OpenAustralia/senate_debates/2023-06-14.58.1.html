        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. Yesterday, in answer to a question from Senator Birmingham, the minister said that in the week prior to 15 February the minister 'came into receiving some information through the partner of the young woman who was going to raise those allegations'. In an answer to Senator Cash, the minister said, 'What you are asking me to do here is to disclose information that was given to me and asked to be kept by me in confidence.' I ask the minister: was part of that information that you came into receiving a copy of material that was always intended to be made public—specifically, a copy of the transcript of the project interview or the interview itself—prior to its release?

          Yes, I did. I did deal with them. It may not have been to your satisfaction, but I dealt with them in a way that I am going to deal with them, which is the statement that I made, and I will go back to that, and the fact that I was given information from a young woman who made a serious allegation about something horrific that had happened to her in this workplace, allegedly—I accept that; allegedly—

                     The answer to that is no. I did not receive any other information from any other source. The information that came to me came only through Ms Higgins and through her partner. And I was asked to keep that information confidential. I did. It was a serious allegation. I was shocked by it. I was stunned. I couldn't believe that something like that allegedly had occurred in this place a couple of years earlier. I was shocked by it and I was shocked by how upset this young woman seemed to be.

                    <p>
                     And I would just remind people—there are essentially two charges against me: (1) that I misled the Senate, which I've tried to deal with, obviously not to your satisfaction, but I've been as honest as I can on that, and (2) that I had some role in the compensation payment; I have not, I did not. So, take those issues up with me. Continue to take the issues up with me—
