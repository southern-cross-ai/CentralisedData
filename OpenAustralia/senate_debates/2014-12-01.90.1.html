        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. The Prime Minister recently said that claims that his decision to abolish bulk-billing incentives will reduce funding for diagnostic imaging are false. Is the Prime Minister correct?

         The Prime Minister is absolutely correct in his commitment to ensuring that we have a sustainable health system into the future. There is absolutely no doubt that it is only this coalition government that is prepared to take this country forward when it comes to a sustainable health system. We were left an economic mess by the previous Labor government that the Australian people elected us to fix. We will do that. That means that we have to take, occasionally, hard decisions, and this coalition government is prepared to do that. We are going to ensure that we have a sustainable health system into the future, and we will be putting the strategies in place to ensure that that happens.

          <i>
           Safeguarding patients
          </i>
          , which states that the government will reduce funding of diagnostic imaging services by $188 million. I ask again, Minister, is the Prime Minister correct?

           The Prime Minister is correct and is correct in ensuring that we have the range of policies in place to ensure that we have a health system that works, a health system that is sustainable, unlike those on the other side, who seemingly could not care less if our future generations have a sustainable health system into the futureâ€”and we saw that by their actions when they were in government. They had six years to prove to the Australian people that they had any kind of vision for the future of the health system in this nation and they failed. We were left an economic mess by the previous Labor government that the Australian people have elected us to fix, and that is what we are committed to do. We will continue to take the decisions that are necessary to ensure that this country has a sustainable and prosperous future.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Does the minister agree with the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association that tests for thyroid cancer could now cost Australians up to $1,326 in up-front fees? How many Australians will be deterred from seeking these tests as a result of this price hike?

                    Thank you. Minister, I remind you of the question; you have 31 seconds in which to answer.

                     I am not going to speculate on a hypothetical question from the opposition. We are bringing the policies into place to ensure that we have a sustainable health system into the future, unlike the previous Labor government, which simply had no plan for the future of this nation.
