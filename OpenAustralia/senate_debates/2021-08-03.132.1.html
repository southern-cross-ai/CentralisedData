         [by video link] In relation to the Community Affairs References Committee report
         <i>

         <i>
          umber of women in Australia who have had transvaginal mesh implants and related matters
         </i>
         , the final report on the government response was tabled by the government in July. First off, I would like to say thank you to the government for coming back to us with reporting on how these recommendations have been implemented. I'm not quite sure if it's a first, but it's certainly very much appreciated, because the 2017 Senate inquiry into transvaginal mesh implants was a very important inquiry. We heard from so many women who had been living with significant negative consequences of having these implants. It's estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 women may have suffered side effects from mesh devices. Many women who have had transvaginal mesh implants have had devastating complications resulting in ongoing emotional trauma, embarrassment, shame, depression, debilitating pain, recurring infection, loss of employment and poor quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         The women we heard from during the inquiry process experienced starkly different outcomes. Not only have these outcomes been severely adverse but most of the women who gave evidence have experienced great difficulty finding medical practitioners who would accept that the symptoms they were experiencing were as severe as they claimed, and said, or that they weren't mesh related. Their struggles to cope with their symptoms and to find support and treatment had so far gone unrecognised on many occasions, and they had far-reaching and devastating impacts on their lives and the lives of their family.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many women who received mesh implants suffered for an extremely long time. Others continue to be in constant pain. It was absolutely heartbreaking to hear the experiences of so many women and that they've been ignored for so long. These women were let down by the system. The system failed them. The way many women were treated when they were trying to get treatment and support when they had such bad outcomes is absolutely appalling and an indictment on the medical practitioners and the system involved in that treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         We heard a lot of harrowing evidence during the inquiry. So many women have been so adversely impacted. There was a clear pattern of poor process and advice which led women to having severely impacted lives. The class action against Johnson &amp; Johnson has resulted in compensation for some women, but the suffering continues. I've been contacted by so many women suffering debilitating and long-term injuries who cannot even access the disability support pension.
        </p>
        <p>
         The committee made 13 recommendations that aimed to address the needs of women with mesh related complications and to improve the regulation process so that this sort of system never happens again. I'm very pleased that the government has progressed 11 out of the 13 recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recommendation 11, which the government has not accepted, needs attention. The committee recommended that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments commission the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Care" rel="nofollow">
          Health Care
         </a>
         to undertake an audit of transvaginal mesh procedures undertaken and their outcomes since the introduction of the devices for use in the Australian market. We need this data collection. We need an audit of the procedures that have been undertaken. It is appalling that this hasn't happened.
        </p>
        <p>
         The federal government needs to continue their leadership on this issue, because they have reported on the implementation of so many of our recommendations. They need to show leadership and ensure that this audit can take place. It is absolutely essential that the women that have been impacted by transvaginal mesh continue to be supported and helped in whatever way possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm very pleased, as I said, that the government has reported on the implementation of these recommendations. I wish they would do the same with so many of the other community affairs reports. I look forward to the implementation of recommendation 11. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leave granted; debate adjourned.
