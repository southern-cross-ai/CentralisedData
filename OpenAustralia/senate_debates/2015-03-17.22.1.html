         There is absolutely no fiscal impact, because we remain committed to the savings. We remain committed to the savings, as the

         , Senator Abetz, has rightly pointed out. I refer Senator Polley to page 88 of Budget Paper No. 2: the $150 million for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy continuation, which Labor defunded. According to Senator Wong this was a lapsing program under Labor. We actually put $150 million into the budget for it. I read on page 88:

This funding will allow the most critical existing research facilities to continue to deliver maximum benefits to the research community.

           . The question was, 'Can the minister advise the Senate exactly how much the latest iteration of the government's university deregulation plan will cost the federal budget?' The answer was 'nothing'. If that really is true then I invite the crossbenchers to consider the government's position.

              Leader of the Opposition in the Senate

             . Clearly, she still does not understand how budget papers work. No wonder that she was the worst finance minister in the history of the Commonwealth! Guess what? If she would have looked closely at what was announced yesterday she would have actually understood that splitting the bills has absolutely no impact on the budget position. She knows exactly that the government remains committed to the savings that are reflected in the budget, and that as far as the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy is concerned the money is already in the budget.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do not know which part of that Senator Wong does not understand but, given that she does not understand it, it is no wonder that she created such a mess of our public finances in her period in government.

                   The Fixer

                  '—said in relation to university funding, 'They're not going to have any cut now, assuming that this Commonwealth Grants Scheme bill doesn't pass.' Will the budget estimates reflect the minister's assumption, or is the government still committed to cutting university funding by 20 per cent?

                   My very good friend and valued colleague, Minister Pyne, was very clear yesterday when he made his announcement, and that is that it remains government policy to pursue the savings in the budget and that those savings will be reflected in a separate bill.

                   Now, obviously it is a matter for the Senate to decide what the Senate ultimately does with that piece of government legislation. But it is the same as was the case when Labor was in government. Over two or three years they were not able to get their attack on private health insurance rebates through the parliament. They kept the budget treatments in place all the way through. We are absolutely acting in a way that is entirely consistent with governments in the past when it comes to the way our budgets are put together.

                          I am always happy to be surprised by my ministerial colleagues when they come up with more savings proposals! Let me also say that I am very surprised about Labor's confected outrage here, given their disastrous track record when it comes to funding higher education.

                              Somebody once said that if you do not learn the lessons of history you are forced and condemned to repeat them. I think the Senate needs to have a history lesson about the disastrous record of Labor in government when it came to higher education. In order to make sure that you have a detailed list of all of the cuts to higher education under Labor when Senator Wong was the finance minister, I table the list of cuts that were made to higher education by Senator Wong.
