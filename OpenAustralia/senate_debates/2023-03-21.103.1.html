         I move the following amendment to the motion:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Omit paragraphs (1) to (3), substitute:

         (2) If it is the final day for consideration of a motion or motions of disallowance, the routine of business be varied to require that the motion or motions be called on for debate at 3 pm, with each senator speaking for not more than 5 minutes each, and the questions necessary to determine the motion or motions put at 3.30 pm.

         We see the need for meeting on Fridays to cover more of the bills that the government wants to push through the Senate. Fridays, in my opinion, should be for government business to deal with the bills. As it is now, the government is proposing to deal with the bills for four hours, but, with the amendment that's being circulated in my name, it would be seven hours—almost doubling the amount of time. That would cut back the need for guillotines and allow proper debate of bills that the government puts up. Instead of theatre, we would like to see debate completed on those bills. Whatever the will of the Senate is, I will abide by it, but I think it is prudent to remind the Senate that we are masters of the Senate and that it is up to the Senate to decide whether it will support my amendment or not.

          The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Roberts be agreed to.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          <i>
           A division having been called and the bells being rung—
          </i>
         </p>
         <p>
          Lock the doors. Before I put the question on the amendment moved by Senator Roberts, I remind senators that when a division is called it requires more than one voice. On this occasion I am fairly certain that the second voice came from the Jacqui Lambie Network. Under standing order 100 you can't seek to vote for an amendment and then vote against the amendment, so at this point that amendment is not carried. I'm going to put the substantive motion. I am happy, Senator Roberts, to record your support for that amendment. That has now lapsed.
         </p>
         <p>
          I now put the question on the substantive motion, which is the hours motion moved by Senator Chisholm. It's an hours motion in relation to Friday the 24th. It has been circulated. The question is that that motion be agreed to.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question agreed to.
