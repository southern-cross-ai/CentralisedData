         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1. No, there has been no such allegation made to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
          ASC
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2a. Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         i. The nine instances included behaviours as listed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         ii. Seven instances involved a single complainant. One instance relating to bullying and harassment of athletes involved two complainants, and an instance relating to unacceptable communication style also involved two complainants. Therefore in total there have been eleven complainants.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         iii. The complaints were upheld in all cases except for the complaint regarding bullying and harassment of athletes. In this matter, following an investigation by an external consultant it was determined that there was no case to answer.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         iv. Actions taken by the ASC to address these complaints include: training; mentoring and counselling; reassignment of duties; and changes to supervisory responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Sanctions applied include formal warnings and in one instance a fine and suspension was applied. In relation to one of the cases of inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour toward a subordinate, the sanction applied was termination of employment.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         v. Four of the nine complaints were managed internally. The costs incurred by the ASC in dealing with or addressing the other five complaints since January 2010 have been for the engagement of external consultants. Since January 2010, the ASC has engaged

        <p class="italic">
         An employee Body Politics has advised that some consultancy work was undertaken for the ASC in the late 1980s.
