        , Senator Cormann. Minister, the recently completed Harper review into competition policy found that Australian laws are deficient and do not adequately distinguish between fair competition and unfair competition within the marketplace. The Harper review recommended that the government amend section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to introduce an effects test in relation to the misuse of market power that would better empower the

        to prevent anticompetitive behaviour, especially against such allegations made against the supermarket duopoly. Can the minister update the Senate on when his cabinet will bring this legislation to parliament so that we can pass this into law?

         The government is committed to implementing our long-term plan for stronger growth and more jobs. As part of that plan we are pursuing one of the most ambitious reform agendas for our competition laws for a very long time. We have initiated the Harper review, which did a very good job and which will deliver benefits for the economy, for business and for consumers across Australia. This is a very important piece of work. This is a piece of work that we are very carefully considering to ensure that we make all the right decisions in the national interest. You would not expect me to give you here today the exact timetable of something that has not been finalised. When the government is in a position to make announcements about our way forward in response to the recommendations of the Harper review we will do so.

           What the government agrees with is that we should do everything we can to put Australia on a stronger economic foundation for the future, that we should do everything we can to strengthen growth and create more jobs. As part of that, we are committed to comprehensive reform of our competition laws. You are asking a question about a specific aspect of that. That is still subject to very careful consideration by the government to ensure that we make the right decision about the best way forward. As I have indicated in my primary answer, when the government is in a position to make an announcement we will do so.

             Let me say right up front that this government is the best friend that small business has ever had. Let me also say that this is the government which delivered small business tax cuts, which the previous government kept talking about and promising but which, of course, were never delivered. This government is working to strengthen growth. This government is working to ensure that significant mining and infrastructure projects can proceed, because we understand the beneficial flow-on impacts for small business from a more strongly growing economy. Small business across Australia understands that the worst friend of small business—

Small business across Australia knows that the Greens are the worst enemy of small business, because the Greens are antigrowth, antijobs—
