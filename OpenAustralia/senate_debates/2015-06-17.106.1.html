        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Brandis. I refer the minister to reports that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE" rel="nofollow">
         BAE
        </a>
        Systems will not tender for the government's $600 million
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Patrol_Boat_Program" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Patrol Boat Program
        </a>
        . Is the minister aware that BAE has said that this decision was taken because the government's time line for awarding of a contract would not see a decision until 2017 and would not see a build until 2018? Is the minister aware that hundreds of BAE workers will lose their jobs in the first quarter of 2016? Why has the government not worked with BAE to avoid this situation?

         The government is very disappointed that

         has made a commercial decision directly as a result of six years of inaction by Senator Kim Carr and his colleagues. For six years, absolutely nothing was done by the Labor government for Australian military shipbuilding—nothing. As a result, lines of supply faltered. As a result, commercial decisions were delayed.

             Senator Conroy, the lead times for major infrastructure projects and major shipbuilding contracts are longer than two years. The fact is that, when the Labor Party was in office for six years, not one Australian warship was commenced at an Australian shipyard—not one.
            </p>
            <p>
             When the Labor Party was in power for six years, not one thing was done to progress the Future Submarine program. In fact, the only ship acquisition for which the former Labor government was responsible was the purchase from the

               Well, Senator Carr, I will tell you what we are doing: we are reviving the Australian shipbuilding industry. We are reviving the Australian shipbuilding industry by completing the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Warfare_Destroyer" rel="nofollow">
                Air Warfare Destroyer
               </a>
               project, a project begun by the Howard Liberal government, during your watch allowed to blow out in terms of delivery time and cost. We are committing to 12 new Australian submarines for the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
                Royal Australian Navy
               </a>
               , something that you did nothing to progress over six years. Your record, Senator Carr, was the delay of 119 defence projects, the cancellation of eight and the reduction of 45. That is what you did on your watch over six years. Is it any wonder that a defence contractor, starved by you for six years, has made this commercial decision now?
