        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. In its response to the final report on the Newmarch House COVID-19 outbreak, the Liberal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        … neither the Commonwealth nor Anglicare Executive had an operational plan for how the residents should be managed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why did the minister fail to have a COVID-19 plan for aged care?

         As we've discussed a number of times in this chamber, there are responsibilities of varying parties with respect to who controls what particular matters. As I've said before in the chamber, the responsibility for the public health response to a COVID-19 aged-care outbreak lies with the state government. That information is actually confirmed in the agreement we have published on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>

         Aged-care providers are all required to have an infection control management plan—

           My point of order goes to relevance. I asked why there was a failure to plan. So far I've heard about a public health response.

            I'm listening carefully to the minister. That was the end of the question, and I appreciate that the preamble was quite narrow. I'm unwilling to go to the exact terminology a minister uses to rule on direct relevance, whether it be a response or a plan. I'll continue to listen carefully.

             The COVID-19 National Health Plan, which was released early in March, contemplates a range of health responses, including for those in residential aged care, and is supported by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia guidelines, which provide advice to residential aged-care providers on how they will establish themselves to manage a COVID-19 outbreak. All of these things are considered. So our plan, backed up by the COVID-19 National Health Plan, which was launched in March of this year, supported by the

             guidelines, contemplates the cooperation between state and Commonwealth in the management and the public health management of a COVID-19 outbreak, and that's exactly what occurred at Newmarch House.

                As the COVID-19 National Health Plan contemplates, the national government provides—and this government built a significant stockpile of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
                 PPE
                </a>
                at a time of global shortage. We do support residential aged care and we do that in cooperation with state governments. In fact, much of the PPE is channelled through state government services to providers around the country. So this is not an either/or situation. Both the Commonwealth and the states support residential aged-care providers, and that is what occurred in this particular circumstance.

In fact, we worked extremely closely together to ensure that occurred. It was a very cooperative process.

                      You don't get to correct the record via a point of order. I'm going to carefully review what he said. I heard a word there that would normally be unparliamentary but it depends if it was directed at somebody personally. Senator Colbeck, I'll ask you to withdraw that.
