          It is a very basic amendment. It is omit paragraphs (b) to (e), substituting the following, and that is (b) 'calls on the government to develop a just transition plan to support affected workers and communities as Australia replaces coal-fired power with renewables'. The question now is that the amendment moved by Senator Waters be agreed to.

          I will just clarify that.

         <p>
          Senator Dastyari, let me clarify. There is a new paragraph (b). The original paragraphs (b) to (e) are to be substituted with a single paragraph (b), which I read out.
         </p>
         <p>
          An honourable senator: I am still seeking a copy of the amendment.
         </p>
         <p>
          I understand it has been circulated. It is deleting paragraphs (b) to (e) and putting in a new paragraph (b). The question is that the amendment moved to the motion by Senator Waters, in the terms circulated in the chamber, be agreed to.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">

         <p>
          Even though I have locked the doors, I am not going to put the question just for a moment, until there is some clarity.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
           Can I
          </a>
          just clarify with the Leader of the Opposition—what if we defer this motion until further down the list? The doors can be unlocked and we will not proceed with the division. We have a number of motions still to deal with.
