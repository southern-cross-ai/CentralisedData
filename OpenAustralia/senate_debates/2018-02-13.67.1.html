        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield: This morning the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        was quoted as saying that he's already considering building a 5G wireless network to bypass the copper NBN because parts of the network are unreliable and corroding. Can the Minister provide an update on what this would cost?

         As colleagues would be well aware, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         has a mandate from the government to conduct the rollout of the NBN, according to what's referred to as a multi-technology mix. That means that NBN can choose the technology that makes sense in a given area to see the NBN rolled out fastest and at lowest cost. That is the reason why the NBN will be completed by 2020—a good six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under those opposite.

                      , according to its last corporate plan, has a funding range and is on track for repeat funding of $49 billion. I reiterate that that is $30 billion less than would have been the case under the approach of those opposite. I also indicate to colleagues that, if an extra $30 billion had been spent, internet bills for Australian households would, on average, be $500 a year more.

                         said. She expresses a concern about mobile competition. If $30 billion more had been spent, as was the plan of those opposite, that would mean that

                         would have to charge higher prices to retailers, which would mean that consumers would be paying $500 a year more on average. Let me let you in on a little secret: if the NBN charged more to retailers, and customers therefore paid more, there would be higher substitution of mobile for the NBN. Labor's business model—their approach, their expenditure—would have led to a much higher substitution of mobile for the NBN. If we're talking about economics adding up, under this side they do; under the approach of the others, no way.
