            By way of explanation, this motion relates to those findings of a very long and detailed Senate inquiry report into housing affordability that was tabled in May of last year. It had good, strong participation by all sides of this chamber—government, opposition and crossbench. I will get to the consensus recommendations in a moment, but what we found, in my view, was that the Abbott government at the time had pursued effectively a scorched earth policy on housing affordability. They had taken and burned to the ground everything that the previous government—with the support of the crossbench and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Greens
            </a>
            —had put into play around homelessness and housing affordability.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were nine recommendations that coalition senators did find it in their hearts to support. This motion seeks any clarification from the government if anything at all has been done by this government on those nine consensus recommendations that coalition senators reported. It is unforgivable that we have heard nothing from the government on the findings of this report.

               The government will not be supporting this motion. The affordable housing report is a substantial piece of work. It took the committee 15 months to complete. The committee received 230 public submissions and conducted eight public hearings. The report is almost 500 pages in length and contains 40 very wide-ranging recommendations.
              </p>
              <p>
               The government needs to ensure its response to the report integrates effectively with other current and recently completed reviews that have impacted or will impact upon housing and homelessness policy settings.

                The Senate
               </a>
               granted the committee a number of extensions of time for reporting, with the final report tabled 11 months after the original reporting date. The government does not consider it unreasonable that the same courtesy be extended in return.
