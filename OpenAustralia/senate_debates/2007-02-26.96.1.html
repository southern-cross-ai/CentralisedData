        initiative.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        24 of the 25 ATCs have now been announced and 20 of these have already signed funding agreements with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        ensuring funding for their establishment and operations up until the end of 2009. At least 21 colleges will be in operation during 2007 with a forecast 2000 students. This initiative has been implemented well ahead of the schedule announced at the 2004 election.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ATCs have clearly been embraced by the communities, employers and industry in the regions in which they are being established. Other communities also want an ATC. ATCs provide opportunities for young people in regions throughout Australia to commence a trade qualification whilst completing their senior secondary studies. They will ensure that over the longer term, industry will have access to a supply of highly qualified workers who will be trained according to local industry requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill will increase the total funding for the ATC initiative from $343.6 million to $456.2 million or an increase of $112.6 million over the period from 2006 to 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The additional funding will provide a capacity for ATCs to provide high levels of support to both students and the employers who engage students as Australian School-based Apprentices.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The additional funding will also address a range of other factors:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Strong industry and community support for the ATC programme has meant more colleges than originally anticipated opening by 2007. This has resulted in additional costs over the five year period.
        </li>
        <li>
         A key feature of the ATC programme is flexibility and each college has been encouraged to pursue a model that best meets the needs of the region in which it is established. This flexibility has resulted in the operational costs necessary to get each college up and running being higher than expected. These costs vary from college to college because every operational model is different.
        </li>
        <li>
         Of the 24 announced ATCs, the industry led Boards of these colleges have recommended in more cases than originally anticipated, that a newly established school will be the most effective delivery model to meet their regional needs. This has had a significant impact on the cost of the programme through increased operational costs.
        </li>
        <li>
         Several colleges have also identified the need for multiple campuses to ensure appropriate coverage of the region and an example of this includes the Hunter ATC which will have campuses in Newcastle, Maitland and Singleton. We are doing more than ever originally planned for.
        </li>
        <li>
         The ATCs need to ensure students are trained using the latest tools and equipment with a focus on enterprise, employability, business and information technology skills to ensure they are as work-ready as possible. While all ATCs have been encouraged to work closely with existing training providers, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         , to utilise existing infrastructure in their region, the ATCs have in many cases been required to contribute funding for this infrastructure to be refurbished or upgraded.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of this bill will ensure the steady progression of the Australian Technical Colleges initiative which will enable 7500 young Australians per year to undertake high quality education and training, relevant to a trade career.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to raising the profile of vocational and technical education. Attracting young people to the trades is vital for Australia’s future and is an important step in addressing the skills shortages that we are experiencing across a number of industries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Technical Colleges initiative offers a new approach to achieving this, and forms an important part of the Australian Government’s strategy for tackling skill shortages.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Technical Colleges will promote trade qualifications as a highly valued alternative to a university degree and will develop a reputation that will show students and parents that vocational education and training provides access to careers that are secure, lucrative and rewarding.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Technical Colleges initiative is just one of a range of vocational and technical education initiatives that the Australian Government is delivering during 2006 to 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In fact, this Government’s investment over that period will total more than $11.3 billion, the biggest commitment to vocational and technical education by any government in Australia’s history.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend this bill to the Senate.
