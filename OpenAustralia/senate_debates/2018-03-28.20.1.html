        As foreshadowed, the government will be moving amendments to these bills. Again I thank the committee for their comprehensive and timely review of the bills. The government has accepted all nine recommendations made by the committee. The government will give effect to the committee's recommendations through these amendments: providing greater clarity and examples on how the legislation is intended to operate in an addendum to the explanatory memorandum, which has been tabled; considering fuel security issues as part of the next national energy security assessment; and, upon passage, providing detailed guidance and support for industry on their obligations under the legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments implementing the committee's recommendations will: amend the definition of 'direct interest holder' and introduce definitions of 'influence or control' and 'associates' to ensure that direct interest holders report on all entities who may be in a position to influence or control the asset or the direct interest holder; introduce an exemption from reporting for moneylenders where the moneylender arrangement does not put the lender, holding entity or subsidiary in a position to influence or control the asset; require that a person receives written notice if they are subject to an

        </a>
        to review the bills within three years of the bills receiving royal assent. I have already tabled associated supplementary explanatory memorandums to provide details on these amendments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed amendments also address some minor technical issues, including refining the definition of 'critical water asset' to clarify that it applies to one or more systems managed by a utility where those systems ultimately service more than 100,000 connections, and ensuring the definition of 'protected information' applies to documents as well as information. I seek leave to move amendments (1) to (20) on sheet

         Before proceeding to deal with the amendments, I wish to place on record a response to some of the remarks made by Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKim" rel="nofollow">
          McKim
         </a>
         in the second reading debate. Senator McKim made a series of remarks about climate change and the impact of climate change on infrastructure. He went on to make a very unrealistic, unreasonable and inaccurate characterisation of the Labor Party's position in relation to these issues, and that characterisation cannot be allowed to stand unchallenged.
        </p>
        <p>
         I remind Senator McKim and others in the chamber that, in 2007, it was the Labor opposition, under
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
          Kevin Rudd
         </a>
         , and the states and territories who commissioned Professor Garnaut to undertake a very significant examination of the impact of climate change on the Australian economy and society. Professor Garnaut did an incredibly detailed piece of work—which I actually had the great fortune to be part of in a very, very small way—which, amongst other things, examined the impact of climate change on assets, including the infrastructure sectors that are the subject of this bill. Upon coming to government, the Labor Party and the then Prime Minister committed the Commonwealth to participate in the Garnaut climate change review, and the Labor Party then established an entire department dedicated to prosecuting both climate change emissions reduction and climate change adaptation. That department had an entire division that dealt with climate change adaptation and it did extensive work with the infrastructure sector, engaging with that sector on how to deal with the impacts of climate change on its assets.
        </p>
        <p>
         It happens that I also subsequently worked in the private sector with a range of businesses in the infrastructure sector, nearly all of whom were actively engaged in assessing climate change risks to their businesses. In fact, I've spoken about this in this chamber on many occasions. Senator McKim's claim that it is only the Greens political party that has any interest in this issue and that it is the Greens political party that has led on this issue is laughable. It is inconsistent with the historical record, and I rise to place that on record in this chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition is pleased to support the amendments moved by Senator Fifield. They reflect the recommendations of the PJCIS. I note in particular the amendments in relation to the review function for the PJCIS. The amendments provide that the committee will review the operation, effectiveness and implications of the act within three years and examine whether or not it would be appropriate to have a unified scheme that covers all infrastructure assets, including telecommunication assets. Telecommunication assets are presently the subject of a separate regulatory regime, and the PJCIS asked government to consider whether or not at some point in the future these two regimes might sensibly be merged. The amendments before the chamber give effect to that recommendation and I commend them to the house.

          Senator McAllister often makes excellent, outstanding, thoughtful and intelligent contributions to this Senate, but the one she has just made does not fall into any of those categories. I'll check the

            <i>
             Hansard
            </i>
            , but the point that I recall making is that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
             ALP
            </a>
            hasn't contributed to the debate around nationalising some infrastructure that is currently in private hands. If Senator McAllister or Senator Cameron or anyone else wants to correct me on that, I'm happy to be corrected, but I haven't noticed Labor out advocating for the nationalisation of transmission infrastructure, for example, as the Australian Greens have. That's the accusation that I recall making. I don't want to get into a tit for tat here, but I think you'll find that Senator McAllister has just engaged in what we should these days call a straw person argument and has torn down and trampled all over a straw person, because, in fact, the things she was objecting to that she claims I had said I actually didn't say. With regard to these amendments, I think it's an indication of maturity from the government to accept the recommendations of the joint standing committee, and these amendments will be supported by the Australian Greens.
