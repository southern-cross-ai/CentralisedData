           which went so well—and about what the Albanese government is delivering.
          </p>
          <p>
           This government, since the election, has supported an increase in the minimum wage and secured a pay rise for aged-care workers. I just want to remind everybody, after the many questions that Senator Gallagher answered so well, that those opposite desperately opposed a dollar per hour for the lowest-paid workers in Australia, but they are prepared to go to the wall over the 0.5 per cent of people in Australia who have $3 million in their superannuation accounts. Australians will look at that and they will understand which side of this chamber is actually about families and working people, which side of this chamber is actually about a better future for all Australians—and which side are too busy focusing on scare campaigns, such as some of the pathetic attempts of those opposite.
          </p>
          <p>
           This government has made child care cheaper. We've made medicines cheaper. We've created 180,000 new fee-free
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
            TAFE
           </a>
           places that we've delivered and 20,000 university places, and we've established 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. The government is expanding paid parental leave. The government is acting to make workplaces safe from sexual harassment with the passage of the Respect@Work bill. We've established Jobs and Skills Australia. We've passed a historic climate change bill and updated our climate targets. We are repairing our international relations and making Australia stronger and more influential in the world. We've expanded the Commonwealth seniors health card and made it easier for pensioners to earn more without losing their pension. We've invested in affordable housing and we've delivered the first home buyers guarantee—

              Thank you, Senator Grogan. This government and the senators on this side understand that it's important that government actually puts in place measures to help address the cost-of-living challenges created under the Liberals and the Nationals. And let's just remember that those opposite presided over increases to out-of-pocket childcare costs of 47 per cent. Let's remember that those opposite wanted to introduce a

               GP
              </a>
              tax, tried to increase the cost of medicines by $5, never increased the number of Paid Parental Leave weeks, said no to social and affordable housing, including for women and children, and, as I said before—most importantly—opposed a $1-an-hour increase to the minimum wage for the lowest-paid in our country. Everyone will remember the way in which those opposite refused to back that wage increase and which leader was prepared to stand up and say, 'I back it.'

                    The reality is that those opposite have no plan to address cost of living, no plan to address the future. We've seen in this question time already that they have not learned from a decade of division and pathetic scare campaigns. But if they think that is what Australians are after now, I have a message for them.
