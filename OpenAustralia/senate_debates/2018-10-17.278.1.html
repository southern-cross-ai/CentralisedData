        2018, which contributes to this Government's commitment to ensure that Australians in the aged care system are better cared for. This Bill gives effect to the Government's announcement in the 2018-19 Budget to establish this new Independent Commission, as part of providing for better quality of care for consumers of aged care services in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The introduction of this Commission is also a direct response to the findings and recommendations of the
        <i>
         Review of National Aged Care Regulatory Processes
        </i>
        undertaken by Kate Camel! and Ron Paterson. I would like to acknowledge Ms Carrell and Professor Paterson for the review as it has contributed significantly to the Government's reforms in relation to aged care quality regulation. I would like to express my gratitude to the aged care consumers who gave their time to provide this Review with submissions setting out their experiences of the aged care system. I would also like to thank the consumer and advocacy groups, aged care providers and their peak bodies, and the industry experts who have made themselves available to assist the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         The Commission
        </a>
        brings together the functions of the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency, the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner, and, from 1 January 2020, the aged care regulatory functions of the Department of Health.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to thank Ms Rae Lamb, the first appointed Aged Care Complaints Commissioner for her outstanding contribution to strengthening the aged care complaints system; empowering consumers to exercise their rights; and working with aged care providers to deliver better care and services. I would also like to thank Mr Nick Ryan,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency for his outstanding and tireless contribution to the regulation of aged care and building a better system to protect consumers and promote quality aged care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This single agency will ensure older Australians and their families have a single point of contact to raise concerns and ask questions about their aged care and to know the new Commission is empowered to respond.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consumers are at the heart of this reform, and the role of the Commission will be to operate a regulatory framework that will protect and enhance the quality of life, safety, health and well-being of aged care consumers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commission is to be responsible for promoting the confidence and trust of aged care consumers in the provision of aged care services including Commonwealth-funded aged care services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commission will promote engagement with aged care consumers and representatives within the aged care sector about the quality of care and services provided by approved providers of aged care services and Commonwealth-funded aged care service providers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The role of the Commission, builds on existing government funded consumer-focused support such as the Older Person Advocacy Network (OPAN) that advocates for and supports consumers to know their rights and have a voice about their care and services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commission will be led by an independent Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner. A single statutory office will enable flexible and responsive regulatory powers and build a holistic and joined up risk-based approach to aged care regulation.

        A single Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will ensure that consumers know who to contact when they require assistance with a complaint, a concern or when something goes wrong. Aged care providers will also know who to contact in relation to their accreditation, assessment, quality monitoring and compliance requirements. The Commission's role extends to all Commonwealth funded aged care service types, including residential care and care in the consumer's own home.

       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will repeal the
