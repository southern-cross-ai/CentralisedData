         for her question. I would like to advise the senator that the premise on which she's based her question about the cashless debit card being contrary to section 12DL of the ASIC Act 2001 is not actually correct. The power is a protection to prevent financial institutions from signing people up to products such as credit cards with preapproved limits without first obtaining their approval. Just as when social security payments are made by another means, via cheque, it's clear that directing someone's social security payment to—

                is—I suppose this is the best description of it—to give the people who are currently on the BasicsCard a technology upgrade. At the moment we believe that there are probably around 16,000 places where the BasicsCard is able to be operated in Australia. The cashless debit card works in nearly one million outlets and basically is able to be operated in any premise that has an

                machine. The inference of your question is completely misplaced in the sense that the only thing this legislation seeks to do is to provide people who are currently on the BasicsCard the added utility and functionality of being able to use a card that is universally recognised.
