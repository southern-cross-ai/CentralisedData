           Senator Brandis, you are correct in relation to the portfolio. However, the minister has made public statements and the minister can be questioned on public statements, so the question will be in order on that front.

               What I would say to Senator Pratt is: 'You really have to get a life.' You would think that the WA Labor Party lost the election. This is how you behave when you win an election—unbelievable. What Senator Pratt has said misrepresents what I actually said on the

In relation to the point of order, Senator Wong, the minister did at the outset reject the premise of the question and the misrepresentation of his statement, and the minister has been relevant to the question. The question allows the minister to be fairly broad ranging in his response.

                   . Here we have important discussions about the future of our economy and the future of the security of our nation and all the WA Labor Party can bring into this chamber is the discussion of preferences. Let me say what I have consistently said—preference arrangements are a matter for the Liberal Party organisations. That is the way it was handled on this occasion. It is a matter of public record that the WA Liberal Party state executive made certain decisions. That is of course entirely appropriate. I have nothing further to add.

                         Senator Pratt is again misleading the chamber because what I have made very clear, including yesterday, is that any proposition which has been reported from time to time that I somehow was the architect of preference arrangements with anyone, including with

                         , is false. I was definitely not the architect of any preference arrangements. Preference arrangements are a matter for the party organisation, which guards that responsibility jealously, as is appropriate. So I would say to Senator Pratt, 'Don't mislead the chamber.' The other thing I would say is that it is time that the WA Labor Party actually started to focus on what they were elected to do and that is to serve the people of
