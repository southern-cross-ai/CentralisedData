        As the shadow minister for education, I welcome the release of the 'Teacher education expert panel discussion paper'. It's an important part of a wider discussion on how we address the alarming decline in student outcomes despite record funding for the education system. The Teacher Education Expert Panel was established to provide advice on key issues raised at the Teacher Workforce Shortage Roundtable last August and an earlier report on the Quality Initial Teacher Education Review, released under the coalition in early 2022. The panel will provide advice on four reform areas: strengthening initial training education programs to deliver confident, effective, classroom-ready graduates; strengthening the link between performance and funding of

        programs; improving the quality of practical experience in teaching; and improving postgraduate programs to attract mid-career entrants.
       </p>

        It's absolutely critical that Australian students are taught by the very best. One month ago today, in my first speech as the shadow minister addressing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Universities Australia
        </a>
        , I highlighted the decline in enrolments for teaching courses as well as the fact that only 50 per cent of students who commence initial teacher education complete their degrees. For those who do enter the classroom, around 50 per cent leave within the first five years. This is not good enough. We need to do everything we can to encourage mid-career entrants into the teaching profession. That's why a one-year

        </a>
        rather than a two-year master's, which means two years of lost income, is the best way to get more teachers into the classrooms more quickly. These people have the life experience, and they're motivated and passionate. It's disappointing that this discussion paper and the panel did not see a case for returning to a one-year DipEd, which arguably puts the interests of universities ahead of prospective teachers. We need to get on with making this change so that we can get more teachers into classrooms.
