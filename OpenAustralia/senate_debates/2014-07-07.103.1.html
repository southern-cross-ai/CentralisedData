        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Senator Ronaldson. Will the minister outline to the Senate how the government aims to fulfil its promise to restore stability, certainty and confidence to Australian industry?

         As an aside, I would like to acknowledge all new senators, but particularly Senator Linda Reynolds and Senator Jacqui Lambie, both of whom have served this nation. This chamber will be the richer for them. I know that you have proudly served; and we are proud of your service.

         At the last federal election, the Australian people voted overwhelmingly for change. That was represented in the other place after September, when parliament first sat, and today it is represented in this chamber with the new state representatives joining us. When we are considering these changes that the government believe are right for industry, I ask that we reflect on what our policies were in the run-up to the last election, and on what has been done since.

           I am fascinated to hear from Senator Carr, because the last time I had a question from him we were still in the middle of bushfire season. So it is probably time he asked a question, if he is indeed serious about it.

           We want to reflect on what this nation needs to do for industry and on what we are going to do to again foster entrepreneurship, and to encourage those who want to grow and those who want to export. The government has a very substantial plan to do so, not the least of which is the abolition of the carbon tax, which again the

              I again thank the senator for his very good question. As I have said to Senator Madigan, sitting opposite are those who took 140,000 manufacturing jobs out of this nation in their brief but quite dramatic period in government. In setting the right infrastructure and economic conditions, which was our first priority, we have introduced a number of measures. One of those is the Entrepreneurs Infrastructure Programme's Single Business Service. That commenced on 1 July. It will bring research and business together to develop and commercialise home-grown ideas and to equip

              s with the management and business skills to lead change and expansion.
             </p>
             <p>
              On top of that, we are also doing many, many things in high-level infrastructure to support skills, such as the $476-million Industry Skills Fund which will put a new focus on delivering the skills—

Get out of the way of us trying to get rid of this toxic carbon tax which is destroying industry in this country. We are losing jobs overseas, and the very people you say you represent are being damaged again by your complete and utter incompetence.
