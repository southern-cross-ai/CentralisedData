        I encourage senators and everybody listening to go to the naidoc.org.au website and look at all of the winners, in particular their stories. I wish personally to acknowledge my uncle and family in Booroolola and Gadrian Hoosan, who received the Caring for Country Award, and all those who look after country. Finally, the Sportsperson of the Year is my son,

        McCarthy-Grogan. I give a special shout-out to you, CJ. It's been an enormous year, particularly with the disruption to your studies overseas. It was wonderful to have had you back in Australia. To have you representing the Australian Paralympics wheelchair basketball team is an absolute honour. I know that you are incredibly humbled by the recognition not only from your peers across the country but also from the Northern Territory NAIDOC committee because of your work for people with disabilities and their families. Thank you, son, for being so inspiring to all Australians.
