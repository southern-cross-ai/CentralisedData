           The Australian government is working hard to break down the barriers that people with disabilities may face in the community, including those issues that restrict and inhibit access to electronic media and communications. The government has provided funding to the ABC to undertake technical trials, of audio description, to inform its consideration on this important issue.
          </p>

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
            The ABC
           </a>
           is currently conducting an audio-description trial on its online catch-up television service, iview. The trial commenced in April and 14 hours of audio described content is available per week. In 2012 the ABC conducted a 13-week terrestrial trial, on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC1" rel="nofollow">
            ABC1
           </a>
           , of audio-description commentary. The results found that while there were significant benefits for those with vision impairment the addition of an audio-description service meant technical problems for a significant number of ABC1 viewers. Following the completion of the online iview trial, in 2016, the government will receive a report from the ABC on the outcome of the trial.
