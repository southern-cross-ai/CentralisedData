        and Water, Senator Wong. Will the minister update the Senate on progress on water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin, and is she aware of any impediments to further progress?

         I thank Senator Collins for her question. Senator Collins and others in this chamber may be aware that the challenge in the Murray-Darling Basin remains significant. A few days ago we were advised that monthly inflows into the Murray system have been below average for some 37 consecutive months, and we received a further reminder of what we are up against last week with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
          Bureau of Meteorology
         </a>
         projecting a hotter than average summer in the Murray-Darling Basin. We on this side recognise the need to act for the future of the Murray-Darling Basin. Senator Collins would also be aware that, as part of that Rudd government’s long-term, $12.9 billion plan, Water for the Future, the Rudd government is investing $3.1 billion into purchasing water entitlements to improve river health, something those opposite never did. We are also investing $5.8 billion to make irrigation infrastructure more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
         As well as these major investments, we have secured a landmark agreement for long-term reform of the Murray-Darling which involves the referral of powers from the different states of the Commonwealth and which is currently underway through legislation in each state jurisdiction and also at the Commonwealth level. So far, I am happy to report that this legislation has passed through the parliaments of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         and Queensland. But while we have senators in this place who are crying, frankly, crocodile tears for the Murray and calling for more urgent action—I am, of course, referring to those opposite—their colleagues are doing everything they can to hold up this crucial reform.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">
          The Liberal

         and National parties, not content with their record of presiding over a decade of decay in the Murray-Darling Basin, are now attempting to delay these reforms in the Victorian parliament. We know what the coalition is good at: inaction and delay.
        </p>
        <p>
         They have orchestrated for the bill to be referred to an inquiry in the Victorian parliament, which may result in the bill not being able to pass through this Senate this year—which, of course, will delay yet again the basin’s reform program. This is consistent with the

          CV

          Senator Wong, resume your seat. There is too much private conversation and people calling across the chamber. It is disorderly. Senator Wong is entitled to be heard in silence.

           I note that the Greens in Victoria have also been part of this referral. I simply remind them that the government in this chamber has agreed to a Senate inquiry to enable scrutiny, and we hope that they can expedite these processes in the Victorian parliament.
          </p>
          <p>
           Frankly, this is precisely what we should expect from those opposite when it comes to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River" rel="nofollow">
            Murray River
           </a>
           . What we know is that they go down to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           , and they demand urgent national reform. Then they cross the border into Victoria and they pull the rug out from under the reform process. What we know about those opposite is that, when it comes to water, as with so many other things, you cannot listen to what they say; you have to look at what they do. After 11 years of doing nothing, their leader, Mr Turnbull, tried and failed to secure a national water reform plan. Now, despite all their protestations, they are still trying to stop the Rudd government from delivering the reforms that are needed for the long-term future of the Murray-Darling.
