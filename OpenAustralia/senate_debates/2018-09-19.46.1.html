            No, I reject that completely. Unlike the Labor Party, we, of course, don't have to have a meeting to get something done. The Labor Party have lots of meetings, and do you know what they do at these meetings? They come up with ideas on how they can jack up taxes.

            We are working every single day on how to make Australia stronger: keeping the economy strong, keeping Australians safe, making sure that funding for all the essential services that Australians rely on are guaranteed within the budget. We are working very closely with all of the state and territory governments on important funding reforms across health, education and in relation to

            -sharing arrangements as well—something the Labor Party has got a completely confused position about. I remember last week Labor senators from Tasmania were describing as a done deal something that Mr Shorten is telling people in

                 As we can see, most of the Labor Party questions go into Liberal Party politics. This is the blueprint: the Labor Party asking about the Liberal Party. We are focused on the public interest. We are focused on making Australia stronger. We are focused on keeping the Australian economy strong.

                  And what great progress have we made on that front? We inherited from Senator Wong and the muppets in the Labor Party—Mr Shorten, Mr Bowen, Senator Wong; they were all there when Labor lost government in 2013. Do you know what they left behind? A weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position. Do you know what we have now achieved? We have achieved a stronger economy, stronger employment growth, a lower unemployment rate than where people thought it would be and, of course, a much stronger budget position with a much stronger trajectory moving forward. We have—
