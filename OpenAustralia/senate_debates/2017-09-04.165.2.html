            The coalition government is delivering a new schools funding system that boosts investment by $23.4 billion and ensures that every student receives the support they need to reach their full potential. For the first time, every student will get the support they need no matter their background or where they live. That means things like more one-on-one time with teachers and support for new or existing initiatives, such as specialist educators or targeted intervention programs. Our position is to deliver the funding support equality that each student needs. We will never support Labor's corruption of needs based funding.

               It is incredibly unprecedented to see the opposition want to silence people in this place from being able to even move an amendment to their motion. What a bunch of cowards! What an absolute bunch of cowards they are! They know full well that the Labor Party have never implemented or legislated the genuine full Gonski. They had the opportunity to do it in 2013. They squibbed the opportunity. They left schools without certainty for years. And now they deny the leave to be able to do this. We were of course going to move an amendment to this motion to say that the Labor Party failed to implement the genuine full Gonski when they were in power. They've failed again.

                  I'm actually very confused as to why the Greens won't support this motion. I worked my way through it and it looks like the sort of motion that a greens party might support. It criticises the Prime Minister's funding plan for cutting $17 billion from school education. It calls on the government to implement a full needs based funding model. It notes the importance of elected representatives listening to their communities. I just wonder what exactly it is in this motion that the Greens can't bring themselves to support. Actually what they could do is stand up and tell us the specific provision, but the truth is that we all know the answer. The reason is that Senator Rhiannon supports this position. This is the text that was supported by the inner-city Greens. This is the text that was circulated by Senator Rhiannon, and this is why they can't bring themselves to vote for it.
