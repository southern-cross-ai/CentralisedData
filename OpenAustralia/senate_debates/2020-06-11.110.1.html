        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Cash. Can the Minister update the Senate on the state of the government's health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and how Australia is leading the world in health recovery?

         I thank Senator Chandler for her question. Over the last few months Australians have worked together to suppress COVID-19, giving us time to prepare our health system to live with the virus. As a country, we have used this time well, sourcing additional ventilators and personal protective equipment and making plans for our hospitals to respond to a surge in cases. We have, as you know, expanded our testing regime, developed our capability to respond quickly to new cases and outbreaks, and improved our ability to quickly identify people who may have been exposed to the virus.
        </p>
        <p>
         Working together, we have now reduced the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 to 20. And the number of people in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICU" rel="nofollow">
          ICU
         </a>
         because of COVID-19 has now been reduced to three. Yesterday there were only seven new cases reported across the whole of Australia—four new cases in Victoria and three new cases in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         As we know, on 8 May the national cabinet agreed to a three-step plan to gradually remove the COVID-19 restrictions and for all of us to move towards the new COVID-safe economy. While Australians can, of course, see that road back, it does not mean that we must not remain vigilant—we need to, in particular, be observing social-distancing practices.
        </p>
        <p>
         We now have seen 1.6 million tests conducted across Australia. Of those, 7,276 Australians have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and, sadly, 102 have lost their lives. But the rate of positive returns has now dropped to 0.4 per cent across those 1.6 million tests.

           Can the minister advise the Senate why it is important to remain vigilant in following public health directions during the COVID-19 pandemic and what the risks are of failing to remain vigilant?

            research has made it abundantly clear today that the risks of a second wave are real and a second wave would have both profound health and economic impacts. The OECD does expect Australia to rebound, despite the global economy facing the deepest recession since the

            . The OECD's outlook for Australia is the third best amongst all 36 OECD nations, but a second wave of COVID-19 infections would wipe out four years of economic growth in Australia and expose highly indebted mortgage holders to possible mass defaults.

              We cannot throw away all of the sacrifices and hard work that we as a nation have made collectively together over the past few months to contain the virus. It is critical that all of us, every single one of us, continues to ensure we do not put the lives of others at risk, the livelihoods of our families and our friends at risk and, most importantly, the most vulnerable Australians at risk. We all need to ensure that we exercise an abundance of caution and follow the medical advice on the additional and practical steps that we all need to take, including: staying 1.5 metres away from other people whenever and wherever possible; maintaining good handwashing and coughing and sneezing hygiene; staying at home if we're unwell; and getting tested if we have respiratory symptoms or a fever. We've shown what we can achieve together. Let's not throw it away.
