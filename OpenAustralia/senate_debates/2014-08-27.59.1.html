         I thank the senator for her question and her continued interest in this area. Two weeks ago I travelled to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APY" rel="nofollow">
          APY
         </a>
         Lands on the northern edge of

         and spent almost a week in that area. I wanted to spend as much time as I could in a number of communities, meeting with community members and key stakeholders to see how our initiatives were progressing in some of our key priority areas. Everyone would know in this place that getting kids to school is a key priority area in my portfolio, and this was certainly a big focus of my time in the lands. I wanted to talk with parents to see first hand the impacts on the lands of poor attendance and find out what local initiatives had increased attendance in some schools but had not been applied elsewhere or had not increased attendance to the same extent.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had the privilege of visiting the community schools at Amata, Fregon, Ernabella, Mimili and Indulkana. I participated in many activities with the parents, students and teachers to gain an understanding of some of the local issues. As I am sure everyone would appreciate, each community has its own different challenges and that is why this strategy encourages communities to come up with their own particular initiatives. Almost all the schools, with a couple of exceptions, were able to demonstrate to me their particular local strategy for engaging with families and communities and encouraging them to support their children's education and participate in school activities. At most schools, breakfast is provided for the children while the parents and teachers get together at the same time. I think it is becoming very much a focal point. Originally it was just for the students, but now that breakfast time for the whole community provides an incredible focal point.

           We believe that the focus point of a community should be the school itself. In Indulkana and Mimili, the new
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal" rel="nofollow">
            Taj Mahal
           </a>
           is the school itself. The existing school grounds have now been turfed, and you cannot lean down and casually pick up a missile, as young men and women tend to do at school. These changes have made the most incredible difference not just to attendance at school—the school is something that the people want to go and see. The community want to be in that school and in that place. I would like to take this opportunity to commend those communities for that initiative. I was also there when the entire school—teachers and students—did a walk around the community to talk to anyone at home who had not quite been convinced. The entire school population of some 80 people went down the road to encourage people to make sure their children attended school.

             This is an area where we cannot just set and forget. There have to be changes in those initiatives and strategies as time progresses, particularly in those areas where the statistics are showing that we are not getting the same sorts of results as we are in those places that are improving. I would like to thank the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APY" rel="nofollow">

             lands education advisory committee, who were kind enough to spend some time with me and provide some advice about the school attendance officers and the levels of support that they may need in a couple of areas. I listened to them and am going to consider what more can be done to improve school attendance throughout the lands. They have asked for heavier duty compliance over particular areas and this will be taken into consideration. We understand that it is now a small number of families that are involved, and I would take this opportunity to thank the committee for that advice. We will be making some announcements in that regard in the next coming months.
