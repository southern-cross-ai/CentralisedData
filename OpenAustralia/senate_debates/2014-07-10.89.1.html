        Placements Program, which has been successful in providing young doctors the opportunity to train and work in rural practice. The President of the Rural Doctors Association, Dr Ian Kamerman, has described this axing as 'crazy' and 'ill-thought out'. Is the Rural Doctors Association correct?

         I am well aware of Dr Kamerman's views on this issue. The government has had to make some very tough decisions when it comes to the budget.

          PP was put in place at a time when we needed to encourage doctors to look to taking up general practice as their vocation. That was some time ago, and also, I might point out for senators opposite, that for the 12-week average period of the PGPPP placement, it was around $55,000 cost. What we have seen over recent years is a much greater move by our medicos going through the system towards general practice, so the need to have those PGPPP places there for those students has decreased.
         </p>
         <p>
          What we have also seen, including from United
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Practice" rel="nofollow">
           General Practice
          </a>
          , was a call to increase the number of GP training places from 1,200 to a higher amount. That is exactly what we have done in this budget. We have increased those training places from 1,200 to 1,500 places. I also point out for those opposite that the 12-month period also comes at a cost to government of around $55,000. So this government, which is making very sensible and very effective changes in this budget, knowing that it was left with such a budget mess, has had to take tough decisions, including responsible action, and that was reflected in the decision about the PGPPP.

             Indeed, it is in the bush. Under the new training places, there is a requirement that 50 per cent go to rural and regional. For the 2014-15 year, we are already at 62 per cent of those new training places going to rural and regional. So the interjection from the senator opposite about them not going to rural and regional is incorrect.

               Just on the interns that the senator raises, interestingly that is the purview of state and territory governments. It is up to the state and territory governments to provide those intern places in hospitals. It is actually this government that is focused on rural and regional Australia. The best thing we can do for rural and regional Australians is fix the economic mess left to us by the previous Labor government, led by the previous finance minister who, as I indicated to the Senate chamber yesterday, trebled net debt under her watch as finance minister. This government is going to take responsible decisions to ensure that we have a sustainable future for this nation not only in health but in all areas. It is this government that is going to deliver for rural and regional Australians, unlike the previous Labor government.
