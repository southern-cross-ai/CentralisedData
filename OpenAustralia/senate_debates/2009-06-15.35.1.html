           I thank Senator Brown for his question. I have read the reports in the
           <i>
            Age
           </i>
           and a subsequent article about allegations relating to a company and some alleged arrangements that were entered into with the printing of banknotes and the relationship with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
            RBA
           </a>
           . The first point I would make is that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
            Reserve Bank
           </a>
           of Australia is independent. I am not aware of the particulars of the contractual arrangements that were entered into with the subsidiary printing production company. I am aware that there is a police investigation underway and I do not want at this stage to make any further comment until that investigation is concluded and a report is provided.

             Reserve Bank
            </a>
            of Australia about these extremely serious allegations? If so, when did that happen and with whom were those talks held? If not, why hasn’t the government asked the

             Reserve Bank of Australia

             As I have noted, Senator Brown, and you have referred to this, there is a police investigation. I understand the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
              Reserve Bank
             </a>
             did issue a statement about this matter on Friday. If there is any suggestion of inappropriate action by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPA" rel="nofollow">
              NPA
             </a>

              is also the chair of the board of Securency, which has now been accused of having agents putting multimillion dollar funds into offshore tax havens as a result of the pursuit of contractual arrangements, including with countries like Sudan, which have been proscribed by the United States because of their terrorist status? I also ask the minister, does it not trouble the government enough to ask the Reserve Bank about its subsidiary’s dealing with the regime of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" rel="nofollow">
               Saddam Hussein
