         (2) There are currently no scientific measures to establish this.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The reasons for any decline may include increasing nutrients, increased salinity, green macroalgae
         <i>
          Cladophora
         </i>
         and physical disturbance.
        </p>
