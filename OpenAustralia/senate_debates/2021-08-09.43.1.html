        Netball World Cup has been played every four years since 1963, and it now includes over 40 nations. In fact, netball is played by 20 million people in over 80 countries around the world. Far from being a girls' game, netball is now enjoyed by men and women alike. It can be played in mixed competition as well as social and competitive competitions. Domestically, 1.2 million Australians, of all ages, play netball. Our junior netball players dream of playing at the highest levels of the sport. And why shouldn't they dream of not just Commonwealth glory and world cup glory? Why can't they strive for Olympic glory?

        . Netball Australia will work with the support of World Netball to see this fantastic sport—this exciting sport that is getting an increasing audience around the world—played at the highest level, under the five rings. I commend netball for the Olympic Games.
