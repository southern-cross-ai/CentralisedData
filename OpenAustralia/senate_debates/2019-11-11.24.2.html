        The department was solely responsible for assessing, recommending and ultimately awarding grants under the RJIP program.

        Can the minister confirm that this statement is not true?

         The RJIP program is what I understand the senator is asking about. I do apologise I haven't got those details to hand, and I haven't seen the article that you're quoting from. I'm very happy to come back on notice and give you the details you're seeking.

           round of the RJIP program, but Kennedy was awarded only $1.9 million. How many applications in Kennedy were recommended by the department but overturned by the ministerial panel? And how many applications in Leichhardt were approved by the ministerial panel against advice from the department?

               Thank you, Senator, for your question. I will take the details on notice and get back to you. The Regional Jobs and Investment Packages help diversify regional economies, they stimulate economic growth and they deliver sustainable employment in regional communities right across the country. It's a program that has made a great deal of difference in regional communities to ensure that we're backing them. We're backing their economic stimulation through that program.
              </p>
              <p>
               The
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
                ANAO
               </a>
               report acknowledges that, for an investment of $220.5 million in grant funding, the program has leveraged an estimated additional $467.8 million in project costs to support projects to drive economic growth in regional Australia. So it's been very, very useful in leveraging local dollars and nous and providing jobs across regional communities.
