         One of the amendments to the bill is said to be minor and technical but I want an explanation from the minister as to why the time for fee recipients to provide renewal opt-in notices to retail clients is extended from 30 days after the client's renewal notice day to 60 days. Why was that time frame doubled as an amendment in this bill?

          It is because, in the judgement of the government and this is a position that is supported, I believe, by the opposition in a bipartisan fashion, that is a more appropriate and practically more realistic timetable.
         </p>
         <p>
          While I am on my feet, I have already flagged in my second reading speech that the government intends to move a series of technical amendments, and Senator Whish-Wilson has already started to debate those amendments, so I seek leave to move together all of the amendments, from one to 29 on sheet

          These are agreed refinements aimed at improving the operations of FoFA and alleviating a number of unintended consequences that have arisen since the FoFA laws were legislated.
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Dastyari and Senator Whish-Wilson would well know that this piece of legislation, the broader FoFA regulatory arrangements, have a long history, particularly in the Senate. Both senators have been in much of that, along the way. As a result of the disallowance of a previous set of FoFA related regulations some further regulations were made, on a bipartisan basis, to deal with some of the necessary improvements, which have bipartisan support.
         </p>
         <p>
          This bill now enshrines these things as appropriate into legislation. These amendments remove measures in the 2014 bill that do not have broader parliamentary support. These amendments include an extension of the time frame for advisers to send renewal opt-in notices to retail clients and fee-disclosure statements to pre-1 July 2013 clients from 30 to 60 days. The bill already extends the time frame for financial advisers to deliver fee-disclosure statements to their post-1 July 2013 clients. The amendments bring the time frames for providing these documents in line with each other.
         </p>
         <p>
          During consultation, a number of stakeholders supported the extension of the time frames for fee recipients to provide their statements. I noted that the 30-day time frame was not long enough to properly prepare and quality-assure these documents, particularly as information is usually needed to be sourced from third parties. The extension of the time frame will also be beneficial for consumers in ensuring they receive documentation that contains accurate information.
         </p>
         <p>
          The amendments also amend the short title of the act—to the bill, at the moment, which hopefully will become the act, to the Corporations Amendment (Financial Advice) Measures Bill 2015. This change is reflective of the fact that the proposed amendments have substantially changed. They are, primarily, minor and technical in nature. The government is committed to ensuring that FoFA operates efficiently and effectively for all consumers and industry participants and, as I indicated in my summing-up speech, we particularly thank Dr Jim Chalmers for his assistance in progressing these bipartisan refinements to FoFA in an efficient manner. With these few words, I commend these amendments to the committee.

           and Dr Jim Chalmers. I have a letter in front of me that you may or may not have, referring to a letter on the 13th, saying that the government intends to table parliamentary amendments to the Senate in the week beginning 23 November and that they reflect the bipartisan agreement reached and there is nothing in these amendments outside of that. That is my understanding. I would like to get your confirmation.

            Yes and no. Senator Dastyari asked me two questions. Yes, this reflects the agreement and no, there is nothing else in there.

             Senator Cormann, you talked about alleviating a number of unintended consequences that have arisen since the original laws were legislated. Could you go into some more detail about what those unintended consequences are?

              Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. As you would be well aware, we have had hours of debate about all the ins and outs of the future of financial advice changes, which had their iteration right from the outset—from the previous government's efforts to implement recommendations from a bipartisan inquiry, locally referred to as the Ripoll inquiry, through the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
               Joint Committee
              </a>
              on Corporations and Financial Services.
             </p>
             <p>
              With reforms of this size and complexity, there are always unintended consequences. Various parliamentary committees have scrutinised this in some great detail. The amendments here in front of us are amendments that have broad consensus across, at least, the two major parties as being sensible technical improvements to the framework that is currently in place and will continue to be in place. As such, unless Senator Whish-Wilson has a specific question he wants me to address, I do not propose to go back through the whole comprehensive debate that we have been having for a number of years on these matters. In fact, that debate started all the way back in 2009. I am always happy to answer specific questions but that is really a question that invites me to go through the whole history, again.

               You are absolutely right, Minister, I do remember the long and lengthy debates and conversations we had, in here, around this. The unintended consequences we talked about related to things I cannot see in this bill. In fact, they may relate to things around catch-all phrases and best-interest duties, which have been removed from this bill and which I am quite glad about. I was just wondering if there was anything more specific that you could point to, in relation to the unintended consequences, in your statement.

                Unless you have a specific inquiry, there were many unintended consequences. I will give you one example. It relates to the way FoFA treats basic insurance products and non-cash payments. Essentially what we are proposing to do here is ensure that FoFA treats basic insurance products and non-cash payments consistently with other simple and well-understood financial products. There was an unintended consequence that the application of the previous FoFA regime went too far, and that is now widely accepted.
               </p>
               <p>
                It also clarifies the intrafund advice provision to ensure it operates as originally intended and not in the broader way, essentially to avoid unintended consequences here too. It makes clear that the client pays exemption; it also applies in circumstances where benefit is paid by another party, as long as the payment is made out of the client's funds and the benefit is given at the direction of the client and with the client's clear consent.
               </p>
               <p>
                So this is essentially a tidy-up bill, which I would have thought was pretty uncontentious.

                  would have put up to this, including the extension of 30 days to 60 days for opt-in. we did hear a lot of evidence during the inquiry that 30 days was sufficient time. Most financial planners and most financial advisers, have good databases; the information systems where their clients would well and truly have advance notice of the requirement for an opt-in and that still gives them a month to do follow-up work on those clients. So that is an example of something we very well might have put an amendment up for. But let me get on record here today that we have not had time to consider amendments. We have not had time to even consider the amendments in front of us and we are very disappointed that we have not had the opportunity to do our job in the Senate, which is to scrutinise this and actually see if we can improve the legislation.
