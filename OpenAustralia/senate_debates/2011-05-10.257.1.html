        , upon notice, on 24 November 2010:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With reference to the answer provided on 14 May 2010 through additional estimates that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'Green Loans were made available for a range of home improvements. Abatement estimates are not available at this time',

       <p class="italic">
        and the answers provided on 17 November 2010 through Budget estimates, months after the 22 March discontinuation of the loans component of the Green Loans Program, that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'As at 31 August 2010, the total value of the 7,448 loans for which the Department had paid subsidies and application fees was $67,900,866.00', and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'As at 31 August 2010, the total sum of subsidies and application fees paid to all financial institutions participating in the program was $13,553,381. This is based on the 7,448 loans for which payments had been made as at 31 August 2010':
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) For what reason are these answers given 'As at 31 August 2010'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Is the department expecting to pay, or has the department paid, any subsidies or application fees later than 31 August 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) (a) What information has been kept on the home improvements made or planned as a result of the securing by householders of Green Loans; and (b) can an itemised list be provided by eligible action (e.g. fridge, hot water system replacement) of: (i) the number of Green Loans provided, (ii) the total value of Green Loans provided, and (iii) the total number of such eligible actions subsidised (noting that each Green Loan might subsidise more than one eligible action).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) What are the estimated emissions reductions resulting from subsidised Green Loans, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) a total estimate for the loans component of the program;

         </a>
         has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The 31 August 2010 date coincided with the date on which data was collated by the Department to respond to Senator Birmingham's original question.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) One invoice is still to be paid for loans that were approved prior to the 22 March 2010 closure date. The Department is seeking clarification from the relevant financial institution about a number of items included in this invoice. Once the items claimed for payment have been verified, this invoice will be paid as a matter of priority.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Information on improvements planned as a result of the securing by householders of a Green Loan is contained on the loan declaration provided by applicants to the relevant financial institution. The Department has not yet received this information from the financial institutions but will do so as part of the overall audit and evaluation strategy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To ensure householders have adequate time to see the benefits of both making improvements to their property and sustained behavioural changes, the evaluation and audit of Green Loan recipients is planned to occur in the first quarter of 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As of 14 December 2010, there were 7,774 loans approved, with a total value of $70,930,829.25.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The Department is exploring whether it is possible to provide answers to some or all of these questions.
