       <p>
        I'm proud to chair the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. Senate committees like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRAT" rel="nofollow">
         RRAT
        </a>
        provide an opportunity for organisations and individuals to participate in policymaking, and it's important to have their views placed on the public record and considered as part of the decision-making process. It's my honour to be able to play a role in advancing matters critical to our agriculture, fisheries, forestry, transport, infrastructure and regional development through the committee. One of the most significant challenges facing the agriculture portfolio is biosecurity, which is why last year the RRAT references committee conducted an inquiry into the adequacy of Australia's biosecurity measures and response preparedness, in particular with respect to foot-and-mouth disease and varroa mite.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all know that the arrival of new pests and diseases in Australia can have devastating and long-lasting impacts. With the ever-increasing volume of travellers and trade across our borders we need sophisticated and well-functioning biosecurity systems to protect our plant, animal and environmental health. A strong biosecurity system is vital for exports, vital for jobs and vital for our way of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        This inquiry was important given the significant risk of foot-and-mouth disease and varroa mite to Australia's biosecurity. I was overwhelmed by the level of engagement with the inquiry, and I would like to acknowledge the significant contributions made by officials from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Fisheries and Forestry; state and territory government officials; industry organisations; producers; research organisations; community groups; and members of the public. I'd also like to acknowledge Minister Watt, who undertook a review of arrangements for exotic animal disease preparedness in response to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMD" rel="nofollow">
         FMD
        </a>
        threats, which was undertaken by experts in both of his departments in August last year. It has been reassuring to see that many of the recommendations made by the Senate inquiry mirror those in Minister Watt's own review, and I understand that actions against the recommendations are well underway.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to state that Australia remains FMD- and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD" rel="nofollow">
         LSD
        </a>
        -free. There have been no reported cases of FMD or LSD, which is lumpy skin disease, in Australia. There is an estimated 11.6 per cent chance of an FMD outbreak within the next five years. An outbreak of FMD has an estimated direct economic impact over 10 years of around $80 billion. The government is committed to a responsive, resilient and sustainably funded biosecurity system. The Albanese government knows that agricultural trade supports jobs and regional economic development and that this relies on a strong biosecurity system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the inquiry we learned that the response to the biosecurity threat is focused on a three-pronged approach. One is strengthened measures at the border. Two is working with partners in the region, particularly Indonesia. And three is ensuring our response plans are up to the challenge should an outbreak occur. New legislation passed through the parliament late last year: the Biosecurity Amendment (Strengthening Biosecurity) Bill, which increased powers for biosecurity officers and increased penalties for those that do the wrong thing, with new infringements of $5,500â€”the highest ever. I understand that more legislation to strengthen the

        will be introduced to the parliament shortly.

        Direct support of $4.33 million has been provided for WA, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        and Queensland to fund a new Northern Australian Coordination Network. The government has made a significant investment in livestock traceability to provide cover for all red meat species, sheep and goat, valued at $46.7 million. It's invested in vaccines and support for Indonesia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        and Timor-Leste, including four million doses of FMD vaccine; training for over 850 Indonesian vets, para-vets and other personnel; and technical support, including training of Indonesian and Timor-Leste biosecurity personnel in Australia. Another $134 million of extra funding was added in the last budget, for extra officers, more detector dogs, increased surveillance, foot mats, biosecurity response zones and a meat ban. During the inquiry we heard from many stakeholders. I'd like to highlight some of the recent feedback on the government's performance on biosecurity, but I will have to do that at a later time. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
