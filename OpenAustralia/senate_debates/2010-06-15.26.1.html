        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Wong. Why did the government deliberately reject the Henry review’s recommendation not to impose the so-called resource super profits tax on small local quarries?

         As the opposition well knows, there were a range of recommendations in the Henry review, and the Treasurer has outlined the government’s response on some of those and has made clear that some of those recommendations are matters which need to be considered more broadly and over a period of time by the nation. The fact is that the

         that the government is proposing is tax reform that is about strengthening the Australian economy. It is about building Australia’s prosperity, something those opposite may have forgotten about. But we on this side understand the importance of ensuring a stronger economy that delivers for Australian working families. I would remind those opposite that this tax reform does a range of things which they may like to gloss over, including reducing taxation rates for small business, reducing red tape for small business and cutting tax for other sectors of the economy through reductions in the corporate tax rate. I would have thought there was—

She has not gone anywhere near the question that was asked of her. No part of her answer is directly relevant to the question. You should bring her to the question.

            . That is the nature of the question. That is the tax reform that they are responding to. I can understand why the opposition are embarrassed about being reminded of their opposition to a reduction in the company tax rate and their opposition to increased superannuation for working Australians. We know that side have always had an issue with the fact that superannuation reforms put in place by Labor governments ensured that working Australians for the first time could share in the retirement savings which had previously been the preserve of wealthy Australians. This is a tax reform that is about a stronger economy and a fairer share for working Australians. We have also made clear in relation to the detail of the superprofits tax—

              The government has released a range of figures in relation to the impact of the tax. The reality is those figures are a far cry from the sorts of exaggerated claims championed by those opposite. In fact the government has released figures by Econtech which demonstrate that the introduction of this tax reform will increase long-run
