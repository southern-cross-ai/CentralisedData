              Thank you. I know that everyone in this place would be of the view that every death on our roads is a tragedy and that, in many ways, is even more poignant when young people are involved. We know that young drivers are overrepresented in serious crashes. There is a range of strategies which governments at all levels have undertaken over the years to try and improve driver safety, particularly in relation to young people. I am advised that the government is helping to improve the safety of young drivers through the keys2drive national learner driver program. This is a $17 million initiative focused on building a constructive partnership between learner drivers, parents and professional instructors.
             </p>
             <p>
              The road toll has improved in the last few decades. Certainly since 1970 the number of drivers killed in road crashes has, thankfully, more than halved. Obviously all of us would want those numbers to be even lower, and in fact for there to be no fatalities. Governments have to work to try and continue to make progress. An important element in the improvement of driver safety has been the introduction of graduated licensing arrangements. Those are the responsibilities of state and territory governments.

               , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer. Could the minister say where the Australian government is in working with the states to develop national standards for the licensing and training of young drivers? Is a time line involved? What standardisation measures is the government looking at? Do they, for example, include standard penalties for breach of rules for L- and P-plate drivers, as well as new technologies for speed and alcohol limitations?

                Senator, I will attempt to answer as best I can on the information I have. I understand—and I stand to be corrected—that this matter actually falls within Minister Albanese’s portfolio, and he is represented by Senator Conroy. I understand that options to further strengthen licensing arrangements for young drivers are currently being considered in the development of the new National Road Safety Strategy for 2011 to 2020. I also understand that the minister with lead responsibility for that, to the best of my knowledge, is Minister Albanese.

                 Thank you, and I would be happy to have that question put on notice so that an answer might come through Minister Albanese.

                 , I ask a further supplementary question. I note that the National Road Safety Strategy 2001-2010 has failed to meet the target of 5.6 fatalities per hundred; in fact, it is way over that. I again ask the minister: is there a national strategy to be implemented during this coming decade—and, if so, when—for standardising the licensing and calibration of performance of young drivers across Australia?
