In summary, Commonwealth agencies considered the Bill's proposal to impose strict timeframes for age determination and laying charges would not be practical or achievable. The limitations on laying charges would also be inconsistent with section 15B(1)(a) of the

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee recommends that the Australian Government review the Australian Federal Police
        </i>
        <i>
         '
        </i>
        <i>
         s procedural and legislative requirements in dealing with persons suspected of people smuggling offences, with a view to facilitating the prompt laying of charges where appropriate.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AFP has worked hard to reduce the amount of time taken to investigate people smuggling offences and prepare a brief of evidence, setting a benchmark of 90 days to lay charges.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of continuing efforts to reduce time in detention, the AFP advises that for the period from 1 January 2012 to 12 November 2012, the average period of investigation from the date of formal referral of crew by DI
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        to the date of charging by the AFP is 74 days.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is committed to further reducing delays in the investigation and prosecution of people smuggling offences. Commonwealth agencies are developing solutions to address delays, including obtaining identity documents from Indonesian consular officials in the first instance, pending a mutual assistance request. These documents may then inform the AFP's decision about whether to give a person the benefit of the doubt about their age, prior to laying charges.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unfortunately, there are often delays to the investigation process caused by environmental factors, which are difficult to avoid. For example, weather conditions may cause delays in conveying items of evidence, such as mobile phones and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS" rel="nofollow">
         GPS
        </a>
        equipment, which require forensic analysis by experts and equipment on mainland Australia. There may also be delays in securing interpreters of specific dialects required for interviews or investigations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, passengers on board people smuggling vessels are sometimes initially unable or unwilling to provide statements, which are necessary to proceed with most people smuggling prosecutions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee recommends that the Australian Government introduce legislation to expressly provide that, where a person raises the issue of age during criminal proceedings, the prosecution bears the burden of proof to establish that the person was an adult at the time of the relevant offence.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the
        <i>
         Migration Act 1958,
        </i>
        penalties for aggravated people smuggling offences do not apply to persons where it is 'established' on the balance of probabilities that they are under the age of 18 years. However, the legislation does not specify whether the prosecution or the defence bears the burden of proof.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There has been some inconsistency in the courts as to who bears the burden of proof. However, in practice, the CDPP has assumed the obligation of establishing whether the person is a minor or an adult, in cases where the defendant raises age as an issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will consider amendments to the Migration Act that would codify current practice by specifying that the prosecution bears the onus of proof in establishing age, where age is contested during a prosecution.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee recommends that the Australian Government review options to support the capacity of the legal representatives of persons accused of people smuggling offences who claim to be underage at the time of the offence to gather evidence of age from their place of origin.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Disagree.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commonwealth agencies facilitate access to legal aid by accused people smugglers as soon as the AFP requests to interview them. Commonwealth funding for legal aid in each State and Territory is provided through the Expensive Commonwealth Criminal Cases Fund. As part of this funding, legal aid representatives are entitled to claim the costs of reasonable disbursements, including costs associated with calling expert witnesses and gathering evidence of a defendant's age in their country of origin. To date, all costs claimed by legal aid commissions, including the costs of travel to Indonesia to collect identity documents, have been approved for reimbursement.
       </p>

        smuggling crew held in immigration facilities are permitted to make domestic and international phone calls, and are allowed to try several different numbers until they make contact with their family or friends. These calls last approximately two minutes, to enable them to let the receiver know of their wellbeing. Individuals are permitted further additional time on a case by case basis. Due to poor mobile coverage in some countries, telephone contact is not always possible, which is typically understood by those trying to contact people in particular countries.

       <p class="italic">
        Internet access is also provided in immigration facilities after people are accommodated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The only time phone calls are not attempted on the day of arrival is when a significant number of individuals arrive on the same day, as there is no distinction in the allocation of phone calls between people smuggling crew and other passengers arriving by boat. In situations like this, phone calls are generally completed over two or three days. DIAC considers these phone calls to be very important and it is a priority for these calls to be made as soon as possible.

       <p class="italic">
        Disagree.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The recommended amendment does not change the practical effect of proposed new subsection 3ZQAA(3) in its current form.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, the proposed subsection requires investigating officials to make an application to a magistrate to determine a person ' s age within 30 days of the person being taken into immigration detention. The recommended amendment to the subsection would require the 30 day timeframe to commence on either the date the person is taken into immigration detention, or the date on which the person first claims to be a minor; whichever is first.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In practice, a person will very rarely (if ever) be in a position to claim to be a minor
        <i>
         before
        </i>
        being taken into immigration detention. This is because immigration detention of people smuggling crew under section 189 of the
        <i>
         Migration Act 1958
        </i>
        commences at the point of interception by

         Border Protection Command

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPC" rel="nofollow">
         BPC
        </a>
        ) personnel. Unless a member of a people smuggling crew is able to communicate their age to BPC personnel (or potentially to any Australian Government official) at least one day or more prior to their interception, the commencement date for the application period will always be the date of interception. Accordingly, even if earlier notification of the person ' s claim was possible, the timeframe would be almost identical.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As such, the Commonwealth ' s concerns with the provision as set out in the joint submission are still applicable. In particular, the reference to ' magistrate ' alone excludes the possibility of a superior court judge hearing an application. Further, the proposed provision does not clarify the meaning of ' application ' , which could be referring to the filing of an originating application, the age determination hearing before a magistrate, or both.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the period of 30 days to conduct an age investigation and make an application to a magistrate is impractical and will be, in some cases, impossible to comply with. The provision also retains the presumption of age in the defendant ' s favour, which has serious implications where the person is an adult and who, as a result of his claim alone, will automatically be required to be detained with minors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth notes that other significant issues of concern about the Bill ' s remaining provisions, as set out in the Commonwealth ' s joint submission, have not been addressed by the recommendations made in the dissenting report.

        Recommendation 1

        3.84 The committee recommends that the Attorney-General ' s Department revise and reissue the

         Explanatory

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 8 October 2012, the Government tabled an addendum to the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill in the Senate, which takes this recommendation into account. The addendum makes it clear that the new offences apply irrespective of whether the relevant conduct occurs in the victim ' s public or private life. Provided the elements of the offence are established, it is immaterial whether the victim and the offender are married or in a
        <i>

        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.88 The committee recommends that the Australian Government further investigate the establishment of a federal compensation scheme for victims of slavery and people trafficking.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia ratified the
        <i>
         Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children
        </i>
        (the Trafficking Protocol), which supplements the
        <i>
         United Nations Convention against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnational_Organized_Crime" rel="nofollow">
          Transnational Organized Crime
         </a>
        </i>
        , in 2005. The Australian Government takes its international obligations, including those under the Trafficking Protocol, very seriously.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Article 6.6 of the Trafficking Protocol states that each Party shall ' ensure that its domestic legal system contains measures that offer victims of trafficking in persons the possibility of obtaining compensation for damage suffered ' . Under Australia ' s domestic legal system, compensation for victims of crime is generally a matter for States and Territories. Each State and Territory has a victims ' compensation scheme, which may be available to victims of people trafficking, slavery and slavery -like practices. A number of these victims have accessed compensation from these State and Territory schemes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As such, the Government ' s view is that Australia has implemented measures that allow victims to obtain compensation, in accordance with Article 6.6 of the Trafficking Protocol. Given these considerations, the Government does not support establishing a Commonwealth victims ' compensation scheme at this time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.95 The committee recommends that the Australian Government review the People Trafficking Visa Framework and the Support for Victims of People Trafficking Program, and consider establishing an ongoing visa and access to victim support mechanism which is not conditional on a victim of people trafficking providing assistance in the criminal justice process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia ' s anti-people trafficking strategy (the strategy) is designed to ensure a balance between victim welfare and criminal justice processes. Prosecutions for people trafficking, slavery and slavery -like practices rely heavily on witness assistance and testimony, and the complete de-linking of witness assistance and visa provisions from the criminal justice framework may affect the success of trafficking -related prosecutions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to the continuous improvement of the Support for Trafficked People Program (the Support Program), aiming to provide a flexible, compassionate victim-focused program that is tailored to the individual needs of each client. The new funding agreement, commencing from 1 July 2012 with the current service provider, will provide greater flexibility and accountability in the delivery of the Support Program, to meet the individual needs of clients.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over the life of the strategy, significant enhancements have been made in response to community sector feedback. In particular, a number of changes were made to the strategy in 2009 following extensive consultation with the community. The changes, which are outlined below, are in line with international best practice and the UN High Commissioner for

       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        To monitor and resolve operational matters, respond to new and emerging issues, and continue to explore ideas for enhancement of the strategy, the Australian Government has established an Operational Working Group, which is comprised of the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Federal Police, the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Immigration and Citizenship
        </a>
        . The Operational Working Group meets approximately every six weeks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the strategy is also regularly reviewed externally by a number of bodies, including through the United Nations. In 2011 the strategy was reviewed both by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Special_Rapporteur" rel="nofollow">
         UN Special Rapporteur
        </a>

        process where United Nations Member States' human rights records are reviewed once every four years. Both of those reviews recognised Australia's role as a leader in regional efforts to combat trafficking.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given these processes, and the extensive consultation on both the Visa Framework and the Support Program which led to enhancements in 2009, the Government does not propose to formally review the Visa Framework or the Support Program at this stage.

        BACKGROUND
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 10 May 2012 the Senate referred the matter of detention of Indonesian minors in Australia to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committees for inquiry and report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The inquiry considered:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) whether any Indonesian minors are currently being held in Australian prisons, remand centres or detention centres where adults are also held, and the appropriateness of that detention;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) what information the Australian authorities possessed or had knowledge of when it was determined that a suspect or convicted person was a minor;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) whether there have been cases where information that a person is a minor was not put before the court;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) what checks and procedures exist to ensure that evidence given to an Australian authority or department about the age of a defendant/suspect is followed up appropriately;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the relevant procedures across agencies relating to cases where there is a suggestion that a minor has been imprisoned in an adult facility; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) options for reparation and repatriation for any minor who has been charged (contrary to current government policy) and convicted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Attorney-General's Department (AGD) made a submission to the inquiry in collaboration with the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) also lodged submissions.
       </p>

         Chief Scientist
        </a>
        regarding the utility of wrist X -rays as an age assessment tool, and noting evidence received by the committee raising significant doubts about this procedure, the committee recommends that the Australian Government consider removing wrist X-rays as a prescribed procedure for the determination of age under 3ZQB of the
        <i>
         Crimes Act 1914
        </i>
        and regulation 6C of the

         Crimes Regulations 1990.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 11 January 2012 the Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Chubb AC, advised AGD on the available scientific methods for determining chronological age. The advice confirmed that wrist X-rays did not allow for precise estimation of chronological age; that results vary with ethnic and socio-economic conditions; and that there were ethical considerations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 'observed variation' of two years for wrist X rays, identified by the Chief Scientist, further indicated that the science of wrist X-rays and statistical analysis from that science was a contested issue that required further expert consideration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Between January and June 2012, AGD consulted further with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Chief_Scientist" rel="nofollow">
         Office of the Chief Scientist
        </a>
        on a number of age determination issues. This included seeking assistance on identifying available experts to assist the Commonwealth with the science of age determination, in particular to critically analyse the scientific and statistical basis for using wrist X-rays as an age determination procedure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 29 June 2012, the Office of the Chief Scientist provided AGD with advice relating to statistics and wrist X-rays from Professor Patty Solomon. In her report, Professor Solomon concluded that there is not enough scientific data in either the Greulich and Pyle Atlas or the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In order to address this issue, AGD is considering options for legislative amendments to remove wrist X-rays be removed as a prescribed procedure for age determination in the Crimes Act and Crimes Regulations.

Where documents received through these processes indicate the person may be a minor, the AFP considers this material in deciding whether to give the person the benefit of the doubt. However, INP officials have advised the AFP that a mutual assistance request is required to obtain documents for use as evidence in prosecutions (in most cases, documents indicating the person is an adult).

        The AFP continues to utilise all avenues available to it to expedite the process of gathering evidence relating to the age of Indonesian individuals detained in Australia suspected of people smuggling offences.

        The defendant's legal representatives may also seek to present as evidence documents obtained from Indonesia containing information about the defendant's age or affidavits from relatives. The costs of obtaining this evidence are covered as a disbursement within a grant of legal aid.

        Credible documentary evidence is not always available to support the claims of people smuggling crew about their age. Only 55 per cent of Indonesian births were recorded between 2000 and 2008. There are at least three different calendars used in parts of Indonesia, and it is commonly the case that Indonesian crew may not know their age or date of birth, and that there may be no documentation of their age or date of birth.

        This recommendation reflects Australia's existing practice for making formal and informal requests for assistance to Indonesia; however any requests by Australia for the process to be expedited would be a matter for Indonesia to consider. It will always take time to obtain documents given the dispersed nature of the Indonesian archipelago, and in some cases documents may not exist.
