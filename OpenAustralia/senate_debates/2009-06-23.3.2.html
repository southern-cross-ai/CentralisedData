         I am surprised that Senator Parry is not speaking to the motion.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         just make the point that we gave leave for this motion so as not to waste the time of the Senate with a suspension. I presume that Senator Parry is not speaking to it because he has the numbers. That is usually the reason when people keep it short.
        </p>
        <p>
         I make the point that this effectively involves two issues. The first is the capacity of the government to order the business and determine the business that the Senate deals with. I am afraid that the opposition have given up on all prospect of ever being a government again, because they have adopted the attitude that seems to forget that there are requirements in this place for governments to be able to operate effectively. By supporting this sort of stunt, they give up, I think, the commitment to a perspective as an alternate government.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the real issue is the question of whether or not we deal with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         bills this week.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          The Senate
         </a>
         has known for months that those bills were to be called on. We have had a green paper, a white paper, no end of public discussion and inquiries both by Senate committees and by others that led us to the point of planning for a debate on the climate change and Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bills in this sitting week.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been clear for some weeks now that the opposition are terrified about debating these bills because they are unable, as on so many other things, to reach a consensus inside their party room. They are deeply divided. The Senate committee reports again highlighted that division. That, quite frankly, is a problem for them. But they have a responsibility to the Australian people to come into the parliament and vote on these issues, particularly given that they went to the last election under a commitment to introduce a carbon pollution reduction scheme. They actually went to the last election, even under
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          John Howard
         </a>
         , committed to that stance, and they have since walked away from it because they are unable to deal with the divisions inside their party.
        </p>
        <p>
         This comes down to a question about whether or not the Senate is going to debate the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill this week. We have a position in this parliament where the government does not have the majority, and we have a position where the opposition and some minor senators have determined to frustrate the government’s capacity to debate these bills. I have to say, at least to Senator Xenophon, that he was honest about it. He has said quite clearly that he does not want to debate them. I do not support his rationale. He wants more surveys, more inquiries, more reporting, but that is perfectly—

               , Senator Xenophon has been open and upfront. I disagree with him; I think he is wrong. But he has at least said: ‘If you force me to do it’—as with this motion today—‘I’m not up for it. I’m not going to vote on these bills or the second reading this week. I am a vote for a deferral. I’m a vote for not dealing with it.’ At least he has been honest. I think it is wrong. I think he ought to take his responsibility to debate the bills this week, but he has been frank about that.

               </a>
               ’s contribution to the last debate, yesterday, on these matters, I am a little confused about what his position is. I think he is currently a climate change sceptic, which is a perfectly reasonable position for him to adopt if that is his position. But, at the last debate on this matter, Senator Fielding argued that he did not want to be dealing with these bills late at night. The reality is that, if this resolution is carried, we will be dealing with the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
                Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
               </a>
               bills late at night at the end of the week because it pushes them all back to that period, rather than dealing with them early in the week when he is fresh and when we are able to deal with them in a non-rushed manner. We could bring them on. But, Senator Fielding, if your position is that you do not want to deal with them this week, say so. Do, for the chamber, the honest thing and say so, because then we will all know where we stand.

                          <p>
                           sensitive today. I do not know why; I cannot understand why. I was addressing my remarks to
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
                            Senator Fielding
                           </a>
                           , for the reason that he will get the vote on this. I have addressed my remarks to Senator Xenophon; he has made his position clear. I expect him to support the opposition on this resolution—as he indicated yesterday he would if the government did not agree to delay the bill till August. We are not agreeing to delay the bill till August. We made it clear that our position is that the bill ought to be debated this week. That has been known for months. We would ask him to consider that. But he has made his position clear. Senator Fielding did not make his position clear in the longer term. Yesterday he supported the resolution. His argument was that he did not want to be dealing with it late at night. Well, what I would say to him—if his position is that he is not going to support dealing with the bills this week—is: say so. Be honest, be upfront and say so. Then we would all know where we all stand.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The same argument goes for the opposition. If what they are saying, as we all know it is, is that they are too scared to deal with the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
                            CPRS
                           </a>
                           this week, then they should have the honesty to say so. Do not push the bill back to be the last bill debated this week, knowing that it is your intention, as Senator Barnaby Joyce has made clear, to talk it out—to filibuster. Surely, now, after all the argy-bargy; surely, on the Tuesday of the last week, you could at least work up the courage to be honest, to speak to your bill and say, ‘We are doing this because we do not want to deal with the CPRS.’ That is why you are doing it. Be honest, say so, and we can all get on with it. But what we have now is this facade that if this passes then the implication is that we will deal with the CPRS later this week. If that is the case, that is great. I will move a motion on sitting hours that allows us to complete that bill this week, and we will sit any hours that the Senate requires to do that. We will sit Thursday night, Friday and Saturday. If you are honestly saying to us, ‘We are just moving it to the end because we think the other bills are more urgent,’ and if the sorts of statements made by Senator Parry yesterday are to be believed, then the opposition will support a motion on sitting hours that allows us to deal with it. But if, as we all know, this is merely a rather unsubtle tactic to ensure that we do not get to the bill, then let us be honest; let us not rely on fake emails or subterfuge; let us just say that the position of the Liberal Party is: ‘We are too scared to deal with the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
                            Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
                           </a>
                           this week. We are too racked by division. We want to put it off until some time after the end of the year—next year sounds good—because it is all too hard.’
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           As I understand it, Senator Xenophon’s position is ‘August’, Senator Fielding’s position is unknown, and the opposition’s position is ‘on the never-never’. This government is ready to debate the legislation on its CPRS scheme. There has been extensive consultation. There has been a green paper. There has been a white paper. Everyone has known that the debate is coming on. So if people are not prepared to debate it now you have got to wonder why. And the only explanation for the opposition is that they cannot reach any consensus. The leader does not feel secure enough to take on people like Senator Cash whose views are from the flat-earth side of the opposition and who do not believe—as Senator Minchin does not—that there is any contribution to global warming from human activity. But because they cannot resolve those difficulties they come in here and hide behind a procedural resolution, which they did not even speak to. I have got to give it to Senator Parry—he gave it his best shot yesterday. It was not very convincing, but he moulded some sort of argument. I am not surprised, though, that he did not have the courage to run it twice, because it did not warrant a second airing. It was pretty thin. I have had to run some thin ones myself, Senator Parry, but running them twice is hard, I know.

Otherwise, if you are not saying that, I will expect you to vote for a resolution to extend hours to complete the bill, because that will force you to make your position clear. If you are saying to us that you are prepared to deal with the bill, we will move the resolution on sitting hours to ensure that we deal with it. But if you are honestly saying to us that you do not want to deal with it this week then that is fine; we will have the political argument about that. But do us the courtesy of saying that, not hiding behind some other, quite pitiful, excuse.

                                Senator Parry was appropriately very brief in his remarks because he was seeking to ensure that we did facilitate dealing with this motion. We are conscious of the government wanting to get on with urgent business, but what we have just had is a remarkable histrionic performance from Senator Evans which has in fact wasted 15 minutes of the Senate’s time. What a remarkable contribution from Senator Evans to so singularly and obviously delay the Senate’s dealing with the government’s legislation by that repetitive performance.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                I was not going to speak, but Senator Evans has made two allegations which I will respond to as briefly as I possibly can because the Senate should get on with its business. Senator Evans made the claim that the opposition has abandoned the longstanding practice of the government being responsible for the order of business. I have been here 16 years, most of which have been in a situation where the government of the day has not had a majority. I fully and well understand that this place does only work with cooperation between all the parties because it is the norm that nobody has a majority and the government should be able to order the business. But that is not unconditional.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                In this case we have the remarkable set of circumstances where there are some agreed bills which are urgent in the last week of June, bills that are budget bills or have 1 July start dates, which the government itself has pushed below the proposition that we deal with a bill which does not have a start date until not 2010 but 2011. It is two years away. The government knows full well our position that this legislation is irresponsibly being proposed in advance of the world’s consideration of the post-Kyoto framework for dealing with climate change which will occur in December. The government full well knows that this should not be dealt with before the United States, so there are exceptions to the rule that the government has control of the order of business. This is one of those cases where the government flagrantly seeks to have dealt with a bill prior to its own urgent legislation, a bill which it knows full well does not have majority support in this chamber. The government itself knows; the government is flagrantly setting this up for defeat. The government is so cynical that it is setting up its own bill for defeat because it knows it does not have the numbers. We absolutely defend what we are doing in relation to this. This is a rare exception to the rule that the government should order the business, but it is an exception where there is this flagrant behaviour on the part of government and where the opposition feels it must act.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                The second allegation is that the opposition are too scared to debate this bill. Our position is very upfront. We announced some time ago our quite open position—that is, that this bill should be deferred. This bill should not be being dealt with. We have a motion still to be dealt with that the Senate defer consideration of this bill.

                                  It is our very upfront position that the government should defer consideration of this bill on the triple grounds that it does not have a start date for two years, that for Australia to legislate in advance of Copenhagen is utterly irresponsible and reckless, and that to advance this legislation prior to the United States legislating, the world’s biggest emitter of anthropogenic

                                   Yesterday when I spoke in relation to an identical motion moved by Senator Parry—not identical but with the same substance of the motion—I indicated that I could not support it unless there was an undertaking by the government that it would agree to not having a vote on the second reading stages of the

                                   bills. I think it is fair to say that I have had some useful discussions with the government, the opposition and my crossbench colleagues in relation to this in the last 24 hours. I understand the government’s position is that they believe there ought to be a vote on the second reading stages of these bills. They do not resile from their position and I understand that.
                                  </p>

                                   My position is that I do not believe it is appropriate to have a vote on the second reading stage of the CPRS bills—not, as Senator Evans indicated, because I want to have some surveys and inquiries but rather to undertake some specific economic modelling on alternative scheme designs, because there is no bigger issue in terms of the economic and environmental welfare of this nation than the design and implementation of the CPRS bills, and my view is that we ought to get it right. I indicate that I will be giving notice of a motion, to be dealt with tomorrow, that there be further modelling undertaken and that the results of that modelling be provided to the Senate prior to the next sitting week of 11 August so that we have time to do that.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   I understand the government’s position—their current position, and it may well be their future position—that they do not want that to take place but I think it is important in the context of this bill that we actually have an opportunity to model not only alternative scheme designs but also what the impact of even higher targets would be. That would give the Senate an opportunity to consider amendments to these very critical bills so that they can be fulsomely debated. That is my position in relation to that, and Senator Evans is right: I make no apology for the fact that I do not believe it is prudent to deal with the second reading stage of these bills this week. That is my agenda. I have been upfront about that.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Having said that, I will also be giving notice of a motion to be dealt with tomorrow that the question on the second reading of these bills not be put this week and that upon the next sitting week these bills be dealt with to their conclusion—so that there is no question but that when the Senate resumes in the week of 11 August; we will sit until we deal with them. I think that deals with the concern that Senator Evans had about these bills being put on the never-never. I indicate—and I have had a discussion with Senator Minchin about this—a commitment that these bills be dealt with in that week one way or the other. I want to say publicly that I take Senator Minchin absolutely on his word in relation to that and I am grateful for that commitment. So I think that resolves some of the issues. It is not what the government wants, but I think it deals with the dilemma of having these bills on the never-never, which Senator Evans referred to.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   I think it would be extremely unwise for us to have a second reading vote on these bills this week in the absence of further economic modelling and without having amendments available as a result of that modelling for the Senate to consider. I think it is fair to say that the coalition ought to have the opportunity to see the results of that modelling and any amendments that are put up in relation to this package of legislation. I think that is a prudent course and I am prepared to support Senator Parry’s motion today as a result of failing to reach an understanding with the government that they would be prepared to put off the vote on the second reading of the CPRS bills this week. I understand the government’s position but I hope they can understand mine, which is that this seems the best way forward for what I consider to be the most important piece of legislation, in environmental and economic terms, that this parliament has ever dealt with.

                                    There have been a number of Senate inquiries and, of course, consequent upon the inquiry that Senator Xenophon proposes we could propose another series of inquiries, because this is a field that is always moving; there is no limit to it. But we are charged with making decisions in the interests of this nation and getting on with the job. I submit that, after 11 years of inaction by the Howard government and now a two-year wait in this period of the Rudd government, it is time for the Senate to deliberate on this matter and carry it through to a vote. If the vote gets up, the legislation will be implemented; if it does not then we absolutely need to look at other models, other alternatives and, we Greens submit, a realistic application of the government’s responsibility for better targets and better facilitation of the nation’s move towards the green economy, which it should be moving towards.

                                    I flag an amendment to Senator Xenophon’s motion tomorrow, which is that we get on with the determination on this matter this week. That is our responsibility and it is what we will be advocating tomorrow. But here we have the opposition saying none of that. They are saying: ‘We’re now confronted with the government’s climate change legislation. Let’s put it off so we can deal with the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee

                                    What a derelict attitude towards responsibility we are seeing unfold in the Senate, after all the debate—public, global, economic, environmental and in relation to employment—that we have seen on this issue. One way or another, the government is on a mission to get to Copenhagen with a determination from Australia, which it should expect out of the Senate. There should be a result. Senator Xenophon’s proposal does bear on the subtext in this place, which is a potential double dissolution election. That is also being put in front of the interests of the planet, in front of the interests of future generations and in front of us getting on with the business of greening the economy and creating the 800,000 to one million jobs that would come out of that restructure, as the Greens propose it. Double dissolution potential if, come August, this gets voted down would move to March—that is what is concentrating the minds of the opposition.

                                    It is just not acceptable for the opposition to say, ‘We want to go out of this place not having voted on this legislation.’ At least Senator Xenophon is saying, ‘I have some specific alternative inquiries I want to make.’ The opposition are not saying that. They are saying, after 13 years of pig ignorance on climate change, of having our heads stuck in the sand: ‘We want more of that.’ That is a failure for this nation. That is a failure of responsibility. It is a failure of intellect and integrity.

                                    What we are seeing unfold here is a filibuster not just in terms of speechifying and presenting vacuous, repetitive ideas to the Senate, which we are going to see in the coming week, but through procedural moves that amount to nothing more than dishonesty because the opposition are not stating what they are about—that is, they are about not having a determination on climate change legislation. I can tell you that the people of Australia will not be impressed by that. It is no way to treat this Senate. But, even more importantly, it is also no way to treat the interests of Australians, who are galvanised by this issue, who want action on this issue and who want people to be able to state what their situation is—and the Greens have been the first to do that because this is an area of priority for us. We have made it clear, first of all the parties in this place, that the targets should be commensurate with the Bali road map and that we should be going to Copenhagen with an intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over 1990 levels by 40 per cent if the rest of the world will entertain similar action; and by 25 per cent if they will not. We have added to that. If you go for the 25 per cent, you can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country by the comparatively cheap alternative—instead of putting $16.5 billion into the big polluters, as the government legislation does—of ending the logging of forests and woodlands in this country and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent; in an industry that is not required, if you look at the wood needs of this nation. But we are not getting to that level of debate. What we are getting to here is boring procedural cat-and-mouse play for a political interest which is all to do with the next election and not with the future of this nation, and that is not good enough.

                                     by leave—I seek leave to make a short explanation. In my contribution I should have indicated that Senator Minchin’s commitment was of course conditional upon the coalition’s motion with respect to these bills being delayed until after Copenhagen not succeeding. I apologise to Senator Minchin for not making that clear. I think that clarifies his position and clarifies my position.

                                      I thought we had this debate yesterday. In fact, if people had seriously considered it yesterday, the vote would have been had yesterday. As I said yesterday, I am not interested in playing politics on this issue; I am interested in being very prudent. The government have made it absolutely clear that for good governance they need certain bills passed by 30 June, and what they are trying to do is play games rather than show good governance. They are trying to say, ‘Let’s get to the end of the week’ and then they will say, ‘Oh, quick, we’ve got these other bills to get through.’ They know what they are doing here. They know that they are supposed to manage business in a way that is conducive to good decision-making processes, and they have stuffed up. To be frank, it is left for the chamber to wait on them with nappies and tissues and to mop up after them. They have made a mistake; they have underestimated how much work has to be done here. Now they are trying to do things in reverse by covering the

                                      issue first. That will chew up a lot of time, and then there will be very little time left to deal with issues that we need to get through by 30 June.

                                      I will make it quite clear that I do not take this issue of rearranging business lightly. Frankly, the government have failed. They are playing games, and I will not be part of the games that they are playing. It is prudent to cover first the issues that they have said need to be addressed and then, after those have been dealt with, get on with the CPRS.

                                       I was not going to speak but I have been summonsed to speak because of Senator Evans’ commencement. Let us just go back to this: we could be dealing right now, right at this very minute, with the

                                       bills. That is what is scheduled for debate at this point in time. I did not speak when I got up because I thought it was a straightforward motion. Yesterday I did not waste half an hour and take up time with a suspension motion, nor did I today—and Senator Evans got up and spoke for 15 minutes. He wasted 15 minutes of the time for CPRS debate, and now it has gone around the chamber. Senator Minchin spoke only for five minutes; Senator Xenophon spoke for just under five minutes;

                                       has done the same thing; Senator Brown spoke for slightly longer. But Senator Evans has taken up the most time in this debate.

                                       We are keen to get back onto the CPRS now. Also, we have made it very clear that the opposition will not sit for extended hours this week, that we did not want to do it in any other week and that we would only do it if it was urgent legislation that had a start date of 1 July. We have facilitated this. I know the government are secretly happy that this motion has come forward, because they would have had to move a motion or come cap in hand and ask us to get back onto urgent legislation because they had run out of time. This is the crux of the matter: they have run out of time. So now we are going to get back onto the urgent legislation. We are going to transact the business of the Senate that is going to facilitate the 1 July start-up issues.

                                       Also, Senator Brown indicated that this is a procedural debate and a time-wasting exercise. Through you,
