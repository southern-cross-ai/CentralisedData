        My question is to Senator Canavan, the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister. Given the minister missed last night's boat, I ask you: will you confirm that you support the Prime Minister's position that imports of the Adler A110 shotgun ought to be bannedâ€”a very simple yes or no.

         I thank the senator for his question. I support the government's position on the National Firearms Agreement. I support that agreement and what it has been able to achieve in this country over 20 years. It is an agreement that is the envy of the world, and something that on this side of politics we are particularly proud of, given we put it in place. I support the government's position on it.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our party here, the Nationals party, we also support responsible gun ownership among the more than 800,000 Australians who own at least one gun. We are proud of that support and we are proud of the support for the laws that we have in place to ensure that ownership is made in a responsible way and people can enjoy the benefits of gun ownership for both environmental and recreational, and other, uses. While, as I have said, I support the government's positions on these issues, I also would like to take this opportunity to say how proud I am as a member of the Nationals in this place of my colleagues who stand up and support the interests of gun owners in this country, who stand up and support the constituents that they represent.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know it is a concept that is sometimes difficult for the Labor Party to understand or for other parties to understand, but we do support the rights of individual senators in this place to express their views, to have independent thoughts and to ensure that they are supporting the interests of their constituents. I am very proud of the way that the members of the Nationals here do that. That is why we have lasted for nearly 100 years. It is a very proud moment for me to stand with my colleagues on all of those issues that are important to our constituents.

            I read those reports in the paper this morning. I think I was alerted to it last night, but I am not quite aware of exactly when. I should say, of course, it is not an area in my portfolio. I do not have anything further to add.

              I refer to reports that in the Nationals' party-room meeting yesterday, Mr Turnbull was described as 'out of touch'. Are National Party senators planning more splits on the floor of the Senate to distance themselves from an out-of-touch Prime Minister?

                I do wonder if questions today are been coordinated, because I believe this question has already been asked this morning, with those exact quotes. As I said to that earlier question, I am not going to discuss matters that occur in the Nationals party room. That would be completely inappropriate, and I will not do so.
