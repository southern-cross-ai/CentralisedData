        I would like to congratulate my friend and colleague Senator McLachlan for the comments he made in relation to the late Hon.

        . I thought that was a terrific contribution. You're certainly a man of the red rather than the green in many respects.

        I would like to congratulate Bhartiya Samaj for their very successful Empowering Migrants Expo, held on Sunday 4 August 2024. There was probably no better place for the expo to be held than at

        , a location where thousands and thousands of new Australians become citizens every year. I would like to congratulate warmly and sincerely Mr Abhishek Sharma, who's the president of Bhartiya Samaj, for all the work that he and his team did in putting on an extraordinary event. There were cultural displays, inspiring speeches, information sessions and invaluable information, all of which helped to empower the new Australians, the migrants who were in attendance. There was so much energy, vibrancy and passion on display at the event that it was very uplifting to actually be there. I'd like to thank all of the stallholders who were there. There were stalls representing the Pakistani culture, Taiwanese culture, Zimbabwean culture, Indonesian culture and Vietnamese culture—I could go on and on and on—as well as a whole range of government organisations, from

        I'd like to quote some of the recipients of some of the awards that were presented on the day. It was great to be part of that process. My good friend Mr Edward Lin,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Australia Taiwan Culture Foundation, was the winner of the Harmony Ambassador Award. He's just an outstanding individual. He's a teacher of physics at one of Queensland's premier high schools. I think he's also doing a PhD at the moment and, at the same time, he's heavily involved in the community. Everything that Mr Lin does is quite amazing. He said: 'I'm a true believer in Australian multiculturalism, which deepens our commitment to universal values, freedom, human rights and democracy. Thank you to all who support our multicultural Australia.' You can see, with those sentiments, why Mr Edward Lin was the rightful winner of the Harmony Ambassador Award.
       </p>
       <p>
        My good friend Aunty Peggy Tidyman, a Gunggari elder, was winner of the Indigenous Partnership and Harmony Award. Aunty Peggy said: 'I'm honoured to be recognised for my work with the migrant community and will continue to support them.' Finally, Mr Yusuf Khatree, an outstanding leader in our Muslim community in Queensland, received the Community Leadership Award. Yusuf is President of the Muslim Charitable Foundation, and this is what Yusuf said: 'I'm grateful and humbled to receive this award. Migrants are integral to Brisbane and Queensland. With support and determination, we can succeed.'
       </p>

        Once again I give my sincere thanks to the President of Bhartiya Samaj, Abhishek Sharma. Thank you so much, Abhishek, for all the work and effort you put in. I know you've booked the city hall for next year already. It was such an outstanding event and I look forward to attending next year to see a display which, in my view, represents the very best of Australian values.
