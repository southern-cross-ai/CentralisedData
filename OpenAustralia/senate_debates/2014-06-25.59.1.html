        <p>
         I thank the senator for the question and her very real interest in this area. I am pleased to inform the Senate that the government is announcing today that it will be providing $9.2 million to a foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASD" rel="nofollow">

         , plan. Measures contained in the plan will allow the government to implement targeted approaches to better prevent and manage FASD.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of the investment, the action plan will provide practical support to women who are alcohol dependent that is aimed at reducing—with a view to ultimately ceasing—alcohol consumption. And $500,000 has been dedicated to the implementation of the FASD diagnostic tool, which is being developed by the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research. A further $100,000 will be allocated to a technical FASD group chaired by Professor Elizabeth Elliott AM. It will advise the government on implementing future FASD programs and promote national evidence based research in ways to manage the impact of FASD. It will also improve information exchange and continue to build on and promote the results of the

        </p>
        <p>
         The government will be providing up to $1.5 million to develop best-practice interventions for alcohol dependent women. These targeted grants will allow further research to be undertaken to develop best-practice intervention guidelines for specialists and

         I would like to acknowledge the work that the member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone MP, has done in this area. This announcement today identifies and reinforces the government's commitment to addressing the significant challenges associated with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

           The diagnostic tool is being developed by the Telethon Institute in collaboration with a group of clinical experts and consumer representatives. The institute has been contracted to conduct a clinical review and trial before the tool can be released nationally. The tool is due to be released for use in 2015 along with user and referral guidelines to ensure that babies or children who are diagnosed with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASD" rel="nofollow">
            FASD
           </a>
           can be appropriately referred to support services.
          </p>
          <p>
           Having a FASD diagnostic tool means that paediatricians have a level of certainty about diagnosing the disorder, which includes a spectrum of health and cognitive impairments. It will also allow our

           s, particularly those in rural and remote locations, who do not have immediate referral pathways to specialists, to make a proper diagnosis. Data will be collected on the tool, leading to a better understanding of the prevalence of FASD in Australia.

             Action Plan will promote consistent messages through primary care providers about the risks of consuming alcohol during pregnancy, including the prevention of alcohol related harm, and continuing activities through awareness of the risk of FASD. The action plan builds the knowledge and capability of non-government alcohol and drug services and primary care services to provide practical support to pregnant women who are alcohol dependent through compassionate and effective interventions. It will also enable the development of guidelines to support diagnosis and early management of FASD through close consultation and partnership with key professional colleges. FASD health promotion resources and interventions will be developed to reduce alcohol related harm during pregnancy for Aboriginal and
