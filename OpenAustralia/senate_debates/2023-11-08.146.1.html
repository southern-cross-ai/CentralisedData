        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The murders of five women in just 10 days are a tragic reminder that domestic, family and sexual violence remains a national crisis. It's now 46 women who've been killed by violence in 2023—records kept not by the government, as I believe they should be and as we do for the road toll, but by a volunteer organisation called Counting Dead Women. What has been made clear from the tragedies of the past few weeks is that the current approach is not working. Will the government convene a National Cabinet meeting to coordinate a national response to combat domestic, family and sexual violence? If so, will you champion in National Cabinet, and commit to funding, a national real-time toll of women killed by violence?

         I thank Senator Waters for her question. Domestic violence is a serious issue in this country. This government understands just how important that issue is, particularly for women in this country. Regrettably, there are no easy solutions to the problem, but this government is obviously happy to look at any measures that we can do that we believe can successfully reduce the incidence of domestic violence in this country. This government has been doing a range of things in this space, and we will continue to focus on the issue. We want to eliminate domestic violence from our society. I know that's a big call, but we want to make progress on the issue. We'll do whatever we can to reduce the incidence of domestic violence, and we're happy to work with you, Senator Waters, and anybody in this place to progress the issue of reducing domestic violence.

           The women's safety sector has long called for $1 billion a year in funding for frontline support services to meet demand and to ensure that everyone who seeks help fleeing violence can get it. In budget estimates this year, the department confirmed that the government is spending half of that amount over the forward estimates. Why is the government only providing half of what the sector has repeatedly called for, when so many women are being murdered?

            I thank Senator Waters for her first supplementary question. The safety of women and children experiencing family and domestic and sexual violence is a priority of the Albanese government. Family and domestic violence does destroy lives—and one life lost is one life too many—and we want it to end. I don't think you're accurately reflecting the spending of this government with respect to this issue. In just our first two budgets—

We believe that's making a tangible difference to women and children experiencing violence now, but we'll also support the critically important work of preventing violence before it starts.

                   I completely reject any suggestion of links between men in this place and what the person you referred to might have said. I think all of my male colleagues understand just what a blight on society domestic violence is and support all of the measures the government is taking to try and address this issue. In my previous answer, I mentioned the $2.3 billion that we're spending in this space to try and end domestic violence before it begins. I'm sure I speak for every single man in the Senate and, for that matter, every single man in the House of Representatives on the Labor side when I say we completely reject domestic violence, and we will do whatever it takes—
