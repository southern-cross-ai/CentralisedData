        My question is for the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, under AUKUS the government is pursuing the acquisition of eight nuclear powered submarines. Are these submarines safe for Australian submariners and all who work on building and sustaining them?

           I think it's interesting that Senator Cash says that calling her a senior member of the coalition is demeaning. I didn't think that was, but I'll leave that to her. To use something as important as AUKUS, which has—
          </p>
          <p>
           May I finish? You asked the question, Senator Cash. To ask a question on a policy which was introduced by your government, which has bipartisan support, which goes to the national security and strategic circumstances of this nation, in order to try and utilise it in a domestic debate to cover up the shambles of a policy you have announced is really not befitting of a party that's serious about national security. It's not befitting. You and I both know—

             President, the point of order is in relation to relevance. Whilst I know the

             likes to indulge in the odd personal attack, that was not what the question was. It was in relation to making sure Australians understand the government's position in relation to whether the eight nuclear powered submarines are actually safe for those working on them.

               I have to say that the quip about personal attacks, from a senior member of Peter Dutton's team, after the weekend—I don't know if that was an attempt at humour, but we thought it was quite amusing! Senator, you would be aware that, when the AUKUS position was announced, your then Prime Minister—and I'm not sure if you were in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                National Security Committee
               </a>
               at the time, but certainly the decision of your National Security Committee—

              </p>
              <p>
               No. I just can't recall whether she was. Your Prime Minister, Prime Minister Morrison, announced the position of your government, which was that AUKUS would not involve the establishment of a civil nuclear industry. We very carefully went through the reasons for that. I look forward to—

                   Senator McKenzie, it does apply to you. Minister Wong has questioned whether that is a supplementary question to your first question, Senator Cash. I've sought the advice of the Clerk, and it is related to the first question.

                    I will make this point: if the senator wishes to talk about responsibility then perhaps the senator should reflect on utilising AUKUS, which is such a necessary and crucial aspect of our forward planning for the security of our nation, in a domestic political debate. We are working very hard—

I would have hoped that, despite whatever debate we have about energy, there might be some modicum of responsibility from the people who want to run this country on national security. But it is clear, as Mr Dutton was on the
