        My question is to the Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts, Senator Fifield. Can the minister inform the Senate what the Turnbull government is doing to promote Australian music on the world stage?

         I thank Senator Smith for his long and enduring interest in and support for Australian music—something which, I think, we all share. Senator Smith and I are probably of a similar demographic and so I would hazard a guess that Cold Chisel's

         may well be a favourite of Senator Smith. As I look at Senator Cameron, I think it is probably Jimmy Barnes's

         </i>
         that rings his particular musical fancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian music scene is strong and is of world standard. It continues to attract the international audiences it deserves. I was very pleased recently to be able to announce that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sounds" rel="nofollow">
          Sounds
         </a>
         Australia, whose funding was to conclude at the end of this year, will have that funding continue. There will be a total of $1.16 million in funding over the next four years, starting in January 2017. The funding complements other Commonwealth funding through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Council
         </a>
         for the Arts and funding from the industry body APRA AMCOS. There is good support from state governments as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian music does matter. I would like to give you one example of the reaction to our funding for Sounds Australia. It comes from Clara, the manager of the Australian band All Our Exes Live in Texas. She leapt to Facebook to say, 'It's a good time for all. An awesome day for Aussie music because Sounds Australia just got their funding back. Yes, Senator Mitch Fifield, you ripper! A good move. Such a worthwhile funding sitch, good on ya, Mitch.' They are all words and sentiments we can embrace.

             I will take the interjection from Senator Wong: I am certain they are, because Senator Canavan could have had the opportunity in Rockhampton last week to listen to All Our Exes Live in Texas playing at the Pilbeam Theatre. No doubt Senator Canavan did that.

             Australia has already participated in 50 international events in 53 cities across 20 countries. These activities promote our Australian music industry to the world, and this new funding will allow representation in our key overseas markets to continue for another four years. To give you an example as to why this matters, Millie Millgate from Sounds Australia said:

                for the next four years is fantastic news, and will be welcomed by thousands of current and future exporting artists and music businesses.

                So this is good news. In case there are colleagues who are wanting to keep track of All Our Exes Live in Texas and Senator Smith, you have the opportunity in Albany to hear them play. I hope you take that opportunity. Senator Macdonald could have had the opportunity in Townsville last night to catch up with that great Australian band.
