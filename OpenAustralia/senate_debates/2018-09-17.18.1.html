        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the Bill is to widen the scope of persons that can be appointed as authorised officers under subsection 81(1) of the
        <i>
         Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011
        </i>
        (the Act).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under subsection 81(1) of the Act, the Secretary of the Department of Health (Secretary) may appoint the following persons as authorised officers:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        a. a person who is appointed or engaged under the
        <i>
         Public Service Act 1999

        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under subsection 81(2) of the Act, the Secretary may appoint these persons as authorised officers under subsection 81(1) of the Act only if the Secretary is satisfied that the person has suitable qualifications, training or experience.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed Bill would enable other persons with suitable qualifications, training or experience in addition to those currently listed in subsection 81(1) of the Act, to be appointed as authorised officers by the Secretary if needed and agreed. This would extend the persons who the Secretary may appoint as authorised officers to:
