       <p class="italic">
        There are two Additional Estimates Bills this year:

        Bill (No. 3) and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 4).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Additional Estimates Bills seek appropriation authority from Parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        . These funds are sought in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last Budget as well as to take into account impacts on Australia’s economic and fiscal outlook that have arisen as a result of the European sovereign debt crisis and instability on the Global financial markets. The total additional appropriation being sought through Additional Estimates Bills 3 and 4 this year is a little over $3.1 billion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook identified several impacts on the Australian economy that have implications to Australia’s near term outlook.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since last year’s Budget, the European sovereign debt crisis has had an increased impact on International growth and overall market stability. Despite the pressures this has placed on the Australian economic and fiscal outlook, Australia continues to outperform the developed world in economic growth, low unemployment, resources investment and strong public finances.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        remains on track to deliver a budget surplus in the 2012-13 financial year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Turning now to Appropriation Bill (No. 3); the total appropriation being sought in this Bill is $2.8 billion. This proposed appropriation arises from: changes in the estimates of program expenditure; variations in the timing of payments; forecast increases in program take-up; reclassifications; and from policy decisions taken by the Government since the last Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I now outline the major appropriations proposed in the Bill:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will provide $1.3 billion in appropriations across several agencies to support its commitment to a Clean Energy Future for Australia.
