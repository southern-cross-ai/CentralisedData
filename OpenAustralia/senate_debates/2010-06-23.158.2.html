       <p>
        by leave—I indicate to the Senate that at the end of this brief statement in the chamber I will seek leave for the full ministerial statement on Afghanistan to be incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        . Today I present my fourth ministerial statement on Afghanistan. Australia remains committed to our mission in Afghanistan. We remain committed to denying sanctuary to terrorists, to working to stabilise the country and to our alliance with the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        The past fortnight has been an exceptionally tough one for our troops in Afghanistan. On Monday, Private Tim Aplin, Private Ben Chuck and Private Scott Palmer were killed and a further seven soldiers injured in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. This closely follows the loss of Sapper Darren Smith and Sapper Jacob Moerland earlier this month. As we struggle to come to terms with these losses, we acknowledge with profound gratitude the sacrifice these young soldiers have made and acknowledge too the willing commitment of their comrades at arms. On behalf of the Australian government, and again of all senators, I offer my condolences to the families, friends, colleagues and loved ones of our fallen soldiers. Our thoughts are with them all. Our thoughts are also with the soldiers injured on Monday and their families, and I wish them, as I know we all wish them, a speedy recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        The terrible loss of our soldiers has quite understandably heightened the debate around Australia’s mission in Afghanistan. It is important that Australians understand this conflict, understand why we are there and understand why it is important for us to continue to play our part. Our fundamental objective in Afghanistan is to combat a clear threat from international terrorism to both international security and our own national security. Australia cannot afford, and Australians cannot afford, to let Afghanistan again become a safe haven and training ground for terrorist organisations. Organisations such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Qaeda" rel="nofollow">
         Al Qaeda
        </a>
        that receive Taliban support have a global reach and are a global threat. The Bali bombing on 12 October 2002, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, was carried out by terrorists with direct links to Afghanistan. These same individuals were involved in the 2004 attack against the Australian embassy in Indonesia and the Jakarta hotel bombings last year that killed more Australians. Left unchecked, the dangerous influence of such groups could again, as in the past, rapidly extend into our own region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Progress is being made towards the goal of making sure Afghanistan is not a safe haven for terrorists. It is steady, it is incremental, but it is progress nevertheless. Six months ago, in Marjah, provincial governance was in disarray, there were no children in school and health care was almost nonexistent. Today there are district governors, 81 schoolteachers and new clinics being built—small steps, perhaps, but important ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Oruzgan, the ADF continues security operations throughout the province to provide safe, secure spaces for development work—contributing to our second fundamental goal of stabilising Afghanistan. Working with AusAID, ADF personnel have been building schools. Government infrastructure has been installed. Living standards are improving in one of the poorest regions of Afghanistan. The ADF in Oruzgan continue to play an important and invaluable role in stabilising the province.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, there have been setbacks, and the fight is not yet over. A recent report by the United Nations states that the security situation has not improved. I acknowledge that there has been a recent increase in violence, but the Senate needs to understand that we will see more violence as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
         ISAF
        </a>
        begins to contest areas held by the Taliban. As we bring the fight to the Taliban in more parts of the country, this will lead to more incidents. But we are making headway. And the military build-up first announced by

       <p>
        Earlier today, I outlined the new arrangements for Oruzgan province after the Dutch forces begin to draw down in August.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dutch" rel="nofollow">
         The Dutch
        </a>
        elections have been held, but a coalition government is yet to be formed. In the interim, I have discussed the prospects for an ongoing Dutch commitment in Oruzgan with my counterpart from the Netherlands, Minister van Middelkoop.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
         NATO
        </a>
        Secretary-General Rasmussen has again called on the future
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_government" rel="nofollow">
         Dutch government
        </a>
        to consider an ongoing commitment in Afghanistan, a call that Australia strongly supports. As soon as the new government is formed, I will, as a priority, engage with my new counterpart on maintaining a Dutch contribution in Oruzgan.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the Netherlands starts drawing down after August 1, a new multinational
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force" rel="nofollow">
         International Security Assistance Force
        </a>
        structure will take command in Oruzgan. Under the new arrangements, the United States will lead a ‘
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Team" rel="nofollow">
         Combined Team
        </a>
        Uruzgan’ under an ISAF flag. More details will be released as these new arrangements are finalised, and I will leave any further comments about the US military contribution to our US allies. But given the commitments which have been made to contribute to the new combined team, we are satisfied that the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTU" rel="nofollow">
         CTU
        </a>
        will more than adequately replace the current capabilities of the Dutch in the province. Slovakia and Singapore will also continue to play valuable roles in this new multinational arrangement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia will play a larger part in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincial_Reconstruction_Team" rel="nofollow">
         Provincial Reconstruction Team
        </a>
        . The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRT" rel="nofollow">
         PRT
        </a>
        is vital to the entire coalition efforts in Oruzgan—in fact it is the heart of our counterinsurgency effort. PRTs are teams of civilians and military personnel working together to facilitate the delivery of tribal outreach, governance and development activities at the provincial and district level.
       </p>
       <p>
        17:59:25
       </p>
       <p>
        They are key to delivering the ‘build’ part of ISAF’s counterinsurgency strategy of ‘shape, clear, hold and build’. By mentoring and assisting local officials, and by supporting economic and infrastructure development, the PRT helps extend the reach of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_government" rel="nofollow">
         Afghan government
        </a>
        in Oruzgan, and win the hearts and minds of the people. The PRT is fundamental to the stabilisation efforts across the province and the eventual transition of responsibility to Afghan authorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia will provide a civilian leader for the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), increasing our role in stabilisation and rebuilding efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Working with our PRT leader will be around 30 other Australian civilians from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs
        </a>
        , AusAID and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        , contributing to governance and development, infrastructure reconstruction and police training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia’s main focus in Afghanistan will continue to be training, with Australia taking over the training for the entire 4th Brigade of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Afghan National Army
        </a>
        . The ADF is in the process of assuming responsibility for mentoring the entire
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANA" rel="nofollow">
         ANA
        </a>
        4th Brigade, including the kandak currently being mentored by the French. The ADF currently mentors the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Kandaks, and the brigade headquarters.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is growing evidence that the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade is maturing towards its goal of independent operations. Afghan soldiers show great courage under fire and in facing the threat of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
         IED
        </a>
        s. Recently, on Operation
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THOR" rel="nofollow">
         THOR
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAR" rel="nofollow">
         CHAR
        </a>
        , soldiers of the 4th Brigade planned and conducted their own resupply operation to Kandahar—a significant step forward for the Brigade. In resupply operations since late last year, the 4th Brigade has moved from observing and participating, to planning and leading these activities. Progress may seem slow, but the 4th Brigade is being well trained and that is reflected in its growing capability.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the basis of solid progress in our training efforts to date,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
         CDF
        </a>
        has recently advised me that within two to four years we should be able to transition the main security responsibility for the province to the Afghan National Army. Following a successful transition of this responsibility, I expect consideration would be given for the ADF to move into an overwatch role. Our troops performed this role in Iraq for around 12 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we are seeing some operational successes, building an army takes time and patience. It is measured in years, not in weeks or months. The Afghan National Army currently stands at 125,000 strong, and is on track to meet its November target of 134,000 troops, several months ahead of schedule. Overall the army will grow to around 172,000 by October 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are one of 46 countries contributing to the effort in Afghanistan. We are there under a United Nations mandate, and we are there at the invitation of the Afghan government. Our aims in Afghanistan are clear. For our own protection, we need to secure Afghanistan and ensure terrorist groups no longer find safe havens there. We need to support the Afghan people as they begin to take responsibility for the security and stability of their nation. And we need to stand with our friends and partners in this endeavour.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am confident that our strategy in Afghanistan is right. It is in Australia’s interests that we play our part in this international effort. It has not been, and will not be, without challenges. And I am painfully aware that it has not been without loss. There could be more losses ahead, but we must stay the course in Oruzgan. We must deliver on our commitment to train the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army so they can take over responsibility for their own security. It will not be easy. We have already paid very, very painfully—16 Australian families have paid very, very painfully—a very heavy price. But I would say to all senators the cost of failure would be much higher.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

        The new RC(SW) covers Helmand and Nimruz provinces. The new Regional Command (South) includes the provinces of Kandahar, Uruzgan, Zabul and Daikundi. These changes were made to optimise a Regional Command that has grown exponentially since its transfer to NATO’s command in 2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With more than 50,000 ISAF troops and eight Afghan National Army Brigades operating across six different provinces, the volume of activity was too much for just one command. The new structure will allow the two commands to better focus on the priority areas of operations in the south —in and around Marjah and Kandahar.

        There is no doubt that there is a critical need for more civilian development in the province, and we are now increasing our work in the civilian sphere, with appropriate protection. Australia is sending additional civilians skilled in diplomacy, governance and development, reconstruction and police training, to complement the work of the ADF in Uruzgan. This emphasis on development and capacity building should ensure a brighter future for the people of Uruzgan and create a strong foundation for the eventual transition of the province to full Afghan responsibility.

         Conclusion
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, ISAF now has in place a clear strategy endorsed by the 46 nations that comprise the Coalition. That strategy is working. Some aspects of our progress are tangible and measurable: clinics are built, children are learning, elections are held. Other parts are not as visible: young men decide to leave the insurgency and return to their homes; communities’ faith in their local government improves.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, we must be patient. Real progress is being made. NATO recently reported that in 2002, 9% of Afghans had access to healthcare; today that figure is 65%. Afghan women hold almost a quarter of the seats in parliament, in contrast to being barely visible under the oppressive Taliban rule. The number of teachers has almost doubled since 2002. The Afghan National Army has expanded to almost 125,000, and continues to improve in capability and expand in size.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, we are one of 46 countries contributing to the effort in Afghanistan. We are there under a United Nations mandate, and at the invitation of the Afghan government. Our aims in Afghanistan are clear. For our own protection, we need to secure Afghanistan and ensure terrorist groups no longer find safe havens there. We need to support the Afghan people as they begin to take responsibility for the security and stability of their nation And we need to stand with our friends and partners in this endeavour.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am confident that our strategy in Afghanistan is right. It is in Australia’s interests that we play our part in this international effort. It is has not been, and will not be, without challenges. And I am painfully aware that it has not been without loss. There could be more losses ahead. But we must stay the course in Uruzgan. We must deliver on our commitment to train the Afghan forces there to take over their own security. It will not be easy. We have already paid, more painfully, sixteen Australian families have already paid, a very heavy price. But the cost of failure would be much higher.
