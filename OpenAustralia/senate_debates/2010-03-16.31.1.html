Nor am I in a habit of announcing things on behalf of representing ministers in Senate question time. I will make inquiries about whether there is anything further that I can add. My recollection is there has been no public announcement about the approach the government is taking. That is obviously a matter for Attorney-General.

              Given that the government received the report of the National Human Rights Consultation committee as long ago as 30 September last year, is the government’s inability to make a decision about a charter of rights after no fewer than three cabinet discussions yet another example of the policy paralysis of the Rudd government?

               I think Senator Brandis had better get his lines right, because I was not aware ‘policy paralysis’ was one of the lines. I thought there was a whole range of lines. That was not among them. But I can say that if there is a criticism on the other side of there being discussions in cabinet, I can understand it, given that Mr Abbott announced the great big new tax on everything without talking to anybody.

                    Order! Shouting across the chamber is disorderly. It will not assist the conduct of the chamber and reflects poorly on those doing it.

                     As I was saying on the point of order,

                     , I humbly submit—unlike Senator Brandis, who seemed to demand—that there is no point of order and that the minister was answering the question directly.

                      I had drawn the minister’s attention to the fact that she should return to the question. The minister has 12 seconds remaining to answer the question.

                       . As I said, I do not believe the government has made an announcement on the issue about which I was asked and I am not going to make an announcement in the context of question time.
