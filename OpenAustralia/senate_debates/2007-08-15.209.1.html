        </a>
        in a parliamentary speech, Senator Webber referred to the evidence given by Mr David d’Lima and Mrs Roslyn Phillips on behalf of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Light" rel="nofollow">
         Festival of Light
        </a>
        Australia to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. This evidence was given in Adelaide on 20 July 2006. Senate
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        records Senator Webber on that date as saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I recall the Festival of Light in Adelaide getting very defensive about the services they offer, because they do provide some of the advice I was alluding to earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is my opinion that this reference suggests the Festival of Light has been involved in pregnancy support counselling services.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         The Festival
        </a>
        of Light is a community group promoting Christian family values. At no stage during the group’s 34 years of existence has it ever provided a pregnancy support counselling service. The Hansard record shows neither Mr d’Lima nor Mrs Phillips claimed to have done so while giving evidence to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        during the debate was also told that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... the Festival of Light—in Adelaide in particular—did not like ... the idea that they may actually be compelled to use professional counsellors who are registered with their relevant professional body—counsellors who have recognised tertiary qualifications in how to provide non-judgmental, non-directive counselling ...
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …            …            …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People like the Festival of Light do not like that idea at all.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe these statements do not accurately reflect the record of evidence which Senator Webber heard as a member of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The Hansard record from 20 July 2006 does not include any statement by Mr David d’Lima or Mrs Roslyn Phillips opposing the use of professional counsellors. I raise this not in any way to reflect on Senator Webber but simply to ensure that the integrity of the evidence is retained and that the Festival of Light is not misrepresented as anything but a community organisation promoting Christian and family values.
