        <p>
         I thank the good senator for his question. Given this was on the front page of the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         , the government effectively had notice of this question. It is not unusual for the opposition to simply go through one broadsheet and then ask the questions accordingly. It is normal practice for governments, when considering these sorts of complex policy transactions—as the opposition keeps reminding us—to seek external expert advice. It is precisely what you would expect from a government that is taking a detailed, methodical and responsible approach to a project of the importance of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         It is somewhat amazing that there has been criticism, including from the shadow minister, about this issue. You would think that the opposition, who have been allegedly clamouring for more due diligence, more information, more consideration, would actually welcome the fact that the government is ensuring it has the proper expert and technical advice, as is normal practice, in relation to this issue. It really demonstrates yet again the hypocrisy of the opposition, because on the one hand they say, ‘We want more time, we want more information, we want more delay, we want more inquiry,’ and then they have the hide to criticise the government for doing what we ought to do, which is to ensure that we consider this issue methodically, closely and responsibly.
        </p>
        <p>
         The only explanation for the hypocrisy of the opposition is Senator Joyce’s own explanation, and that is: this is not about policy, this is not about transparency; this is about the opposition’s political agenda. They will wreck and oppose everything.

            I will take Senator Conroy’s interjection, when he reminded the good senator asking the question of the answer yesterday, in response to Senator Brandis, about the date on which the business case was received. This is normal practice; this is appropriate practice. Similar arrangements were entered into by past governments when commercial or business advisers were commissioned. They included Telstra 1, which was

What we now have is the opposition taking the opportunity to take a point of order—not stating what the point of order is about but jumping up and restating the question. That is what we are now having.

                Hansard
               </i>

                . As I was reminding the opposition, seeking independent advice frequently has occurred under governments of both persuasions. It is normal practice; it is standard practice. I was reminding the opposition of the various independent sources of advice they commissioned, and it is normal for this to occur in relation to policy transactions.

                  I am asked about second thoughts. It would be interesting, Senator, if I had the opportunity in the 60 seconds remaining to go through the various statements made by the opposition on telecommunications policy. They have not had just second thoughts; they have had third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh—all the way up to 18 plans on broadband. They have had 18 plans in the telecommunications sector.
