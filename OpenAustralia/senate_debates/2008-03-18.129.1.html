         Introduction—the case for national action
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Lifting investment in new physical infrastructure while at the same time making better use of the nation’s existing infrastructure is a key element of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudd_Labor_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Rudd Labor Government
        </a>
        ’s plan to raise productivity, fight inflation and maintain economic growth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Well-planned infrastructure is the arteries of a successful, modern economy and essential to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         making our cities liveable and improving public health;
        </li>
        <li>
         bringing economic opportunities to regional and rural communities, generators of 65 percent of the nation’s export income;
        </li>
        <li>
         delivering products to markets;
        </li>
        <li>
         reducing business costs;
        </li>
        <li>
         connecting local companies to the global knowledge economy; and
        </li>
        <li>
         reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        And in the case of a country like Australia with its vast distances and highly urbanised population, the delivery of good, reliable infrastructure takes on even greater economic and social importance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By contrast, a failure to fix infrastructure shortfalls, supply chain bottlenecks and urban congestion puts a brake on economic and productivity growth, creates inflationary pressures, and over the longer term, will leave us ill-equipped to respond to the challenges of climate change, an ageing population and globalisation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What’s more, in modern, industrialised countries such as Australia, the various infrastructure systems are interacting ever more closely, creating interdependencies that heighten the risk of problems in one flowing onto another.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example, capacity constraints on railways can affect the functioning of ports; water shortages can impede industrial production; and improvements to an arterial road can simply distribute the traffic snarls elsewhere.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2004, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Council
        </a>
        for Infrastructure Development estimated that the lack of investment in the nation’s infrastructure over many years cost the economy around $6.4 billion a year in lost production.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to slowing economic growth, poor and inadequate infrastructure has a direct impact on family budgets and the bottom line of businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The cost of urban congestion in our major cities alone was estimated by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics at $9.4 billion in 2005, and in the absence of reform, will climb to more than $20 billion by 2020, with the total length of congested roads likely to treble.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But the costs cannot simply be measured in economic terms.  For many families urban congestion means parents spending more time commuting in their cars than at home with their children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When it comes to ‘keeping the lights on’ here too we have much work to do, with an estimated 30 to 35 billion dollars worth of investment required in the nation’s energy sector by 2020.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia’s international gateways—our ports and airports—will also need to modernise and expand in response to growing and changing demand.  For example, international container trade will almost triple by 2020 and air travel is set to jump by 160 per cent over the first quarter of this century.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And with many of our infrastructure challenges I am not just talking about the need for ‘big things’.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         A clear vision for action
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The infrastructure challenges inherited by this Government—some of which I’ve just outlined—are the result of decades of poor planning and underinvestment.  In fact, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        ranks Australia 20
        <sup>
         th
        </sup>
        out of 25 countries when it comes to investment in public infrastructure as a proportion of national income.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government is determined to bring a fresh approach to developing and modernising the nation’s physical infrastructure: replacing neglect, ‘buck passing’ and ‘pork-barrelling’ with long term planning where governments predict and anticipate infrastructure needs and demands, not merely react to them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In short, the Commonwealth Government is back in the business of nation-building.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         The need for cooperation between governments and with the private sector
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Nation-building requires the cooperation of all Australian government—particularly in a federal political system like ours with its divided responsibilities—as well as the involvement of all sectors of the economy, both public and private.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Put simply, nation-building requires coordinated solutions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unfortunately up until now, the provision of nationally important infrastructure has been considered separately, within different levels of government and in isolation from each other.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Access to ports, for example, can involve the three levels of government, the rail and road transport industry, the port owners and stevedores.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And as the recent capacity constraints in the Queensland and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Valley
        </a>
        coal chains have shown, a lack of coordination between governments and the private sector inevitably results in a loss of national income and reduced opportunities for our export industries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the same time governments, industry and the investment community need the certainty in planning and evaluation that guarantees good returns—both in profits and the benefits delivered to the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Infrastructure investment needs to be determined objectively and according to long term need, not short term political interests—thereby creating an environment conducive to greater private investment in public infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So nation building requires not only foresight, but a more nationally-coordinated approach to infrastructure reform and investment—something the business community has long championed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Business Council of Australia in its
        <i>
         Infrastructure Action Plan for Future Prosperity
        </i>
        report called for “…
        <i>
         an integrated long-term planning framework across jurisdictions for the coordinated provision of infrastructure … to underpin sustained strong economic growth.”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need a mechanism that will achieve both these ends—and in so doing, lock in Australia’s future prosperity and higher productivity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today we don’t have one.

         Conclusion
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As I have indicated, Australia’s physical infrastructure—including strategic energy, transport, communication and water assets—provides an essential input to virtually all economic activities and contributes directly to community well-being.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>
         Infrastructure Australia
        </i>
        legislation is a continuation of a century long Labor tradition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor has always been the party of nation building—it is in our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
         DNA
        </a>
        and when it comes to delivering major infrastructure projects we have the historic runs on the broad.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let’s not forget it was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chifley" rel="nofollow">
         Ben Chifley
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Snowy Scheme

        and initiated post-war Reconstruction; it was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        that fixed the sewerage systems of our major cities; and it was the Hawke/Keating governments that invested in urban renewal and built social infrastructure such as Medicare and compulsory superannuation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Each of these governments demonstrated what is possible with national leadership.  And I can assure the House the Rudd Labor Government will be a government which adapts the strong Labor tradition to the needs of the new century.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Or to take the words used by Ben Chifley when announcing work would start on one of this country’s greatest infrastructure projects, the Snowy Scheme:
