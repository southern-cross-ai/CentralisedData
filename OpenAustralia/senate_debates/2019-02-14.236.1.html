       <p>
        by leaveâ€”I wish to place a matter on the public record today in relation to my brother, who, through his involvement in a consortium, has acquired just over a seven per cent interest in the Ralston coalmine and its related assets. As a result of this transaction, my brother-in-law will acquire a just over 0.7 per cent interest as well. This information has been revealed this afternoon as part of an update to the market by the companies involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that I comply with the Statement of Ministerial Standards, which includes seeking advice from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
        </a>
        regarding the appropriate course of action. This includes disclosing interests held by immediate family members during the deliberations of cabinet, in accordance with the requirements of the
        <i>
         Cabinet Handbook
        </i>
        , and arranging, as per this advice, that any decisions that involve actual conflict of interest between immediate family members, interests and ministerial responsibilities are referred to another minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also sought advice from the office of the Clerk of the Senate regarding any obligation I have to include this information on the Register of Senators' Interests. This advice has indicated that I am under no obligation to record this on the register. However, in the interests of transparency and public accountability I wish to place this development and the steps I have taken to address them on the public record.
