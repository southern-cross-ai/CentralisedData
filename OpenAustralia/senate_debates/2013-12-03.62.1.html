        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, in his capacity as shareholder minister for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . I refer to media reports of advice prepared by NBN Co. during the caretaker period for the incoming government, which states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … it is unlikely that NBN Co will meet the 2016 deadline to upgrade the fixed network to enable Australians to have minimum download speeds of 25Mbps.

        I note also

         Ziggy Switkowski

        's evidence to a Senate committee last week that '2016 as a deadline is very, very demanding.' Will the minister confirm that the government will meet its promise that by 2016 every Australian household and business will have access to broadband speeds of at least 25 megabits per second, or will this be another broken promise?

         project is another fine mess that we inherited from the Labor Party. Since the election this government has worked carefully, methodically and purposefully to fix the mess that we inherited from the Labor Party. We have done exactly what we said before the election that we would do, and that is to go through a proper strategic review of NBN Co. That review is about to be released and it will be there for all to see: the fine mess that Senator Conroy and Senator Wong, shareholder ministers of NBN Co., made under the previous government. This government will deliver faster, better broadband more affordably for taxpayers and more affordably for consumers. We are fixing the mess that you created.

           I completely reject the assertions that are the premise of the question. We are focused and we will deliver faster, better broadband sooner than Labor would have, and we will do it in a way that is more cost-efficient—to the benefit of taxpayers—and more affordable for consumers.

             Ziggy Switkowski

            , at last week's Senate hearings dismissed these cost savings as 'not passing a special test'. Will the minister confirm that NBN Co. has identified billions of dollars of cost savings? And does he support rejecting these savings just so Mr Turnbull's mates can deliver a 'special' NBN review that justifies the government's switch to a second-rate broadband—
