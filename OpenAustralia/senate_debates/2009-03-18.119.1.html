         Customs Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009

        . I attended the previous division. I was unaware that the bill was to be recommitted. I returned to a meeting being held in 2R2. At 17.57 I received a paged message to attend the division in the chamber. I immediately left 2R2 to attend the chamber. Halfway through my passage to the chamber, the bells stopped ringing. On reaching the chamber, the whip’s office advised me that two paged messages had been issued, one at 17.55 and a second at 17.57. I did not receive the first paged message at 17.55. I am advised by the whip’s office that my absence did not affect the outcome of the vote. I have subsequently provided my pager to the

         by leave—We accept in full the explanation of Senator Bishop. We thank him very much for apologising to the chamber and for acknowledging that he missed a division. Unlike others opposite, we are not going to make a big issue out of this. We understand that this happens from time to time. It is important that we all reflect on this. The business of this chamber means that some senators on the odd occasions will not be able to attend the chamber for divisions. We certainly thank Senator Bishop for his comments and his apology to the chamber.
