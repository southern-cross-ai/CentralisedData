        My question without notice is to Senator Minchin, Minister representing the Prime Minister. Minister, hasn’t the Prime Minister taken his eye off the ball when it comes to ministerial standards? Isn’t the Prime Minister personally responsible for allowing Senator Santoro’s questionable behaviour to go unchecked for some time, given that he, first, covered up Senator Santoro’s share trading breach in October 2006; second, failed to act when Senator Santoro’s Liberal mate Russell Egan Jr boasted that he hit the jackpot in being awarded 94 aged-care bed licences in January 2007; third, looked the other way when Senator Santoro fronted a Liberal Party fundraiser sponsored by an aged-care provider in January 2007; and, fourth, ignored the two ongoing

         That was a rant at the end of question time which made no sense and did not contribute anything to the debate. It was essentially a repetition of questions asked earlier. I am happy to repeat my answers to the questions regarding this matter. The Prime Minister has acted properly and honourably in respect of this matter at all times. When the matter of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB" rel="nofollow">
          CB
         </a>
         io was drawn to his attention he required Senator Santoro to act according to a proper and honourable course of action. He required him to dispose of those shares. The profits from those shares were given to another organisation. He ensured that the declarations were properly made. When the Prime Minister learnt last week of the nondeclaration of a series of share transactions during the course of Senator Santoro’s period as minister, Senator Santoro tendered his resignation, which the Prime Minister properly accepted. The Prime Minister’s conduct has been exemplary throughout this period. The Prime Minister expects very high standards from his ministers. Senator Santoro regrettably failed to meet those high standards and has paid the price.
        </p>
        <p>
         I repeat that Senator Santoro is regarded throughout the aged-care industry, and I think throughout Australia, as having been a very good senator and Minister for Ageing and will be remembered well for his performance in this portfolio. He got on top of a very difficult portfolio very quickly indeed. His only sin was to not declare shares which he bought and sold during that period.
        </p>
        <p>
         How does this compare to the performance of ministers in other states? Senator Carr from the Labor Party, this factional hack from the Victorian Labor Party who is always at war with his other factional hack—they are trying to kill each other in Victoria—represents a party which is responsible for the most appalling performance by ministers in its state governments. What is he doing about the performance of ministers in state Labor governments?

            , I ask a supplementary question. I ask the minister: rather than engaging in the blame game, how many warnings does the Prime Minister need to have before he realises that the standards of his government have swept to new lows? Why should the Australian people have any faith in your government’s ability to adhere to proper standards of accountability into the future?
