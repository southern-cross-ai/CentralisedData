        Tasmania is the turnaround state. Tasmania's economic health is about as good as it has ever been. Today, my home state of Tasmania, thanks to the shrewd stewardship of federal and state Liberal governments, has economic indicators that are the envy of the other states. First, let's be clear why we on this side pursue good economic outcomes. It's not because we want some prize in pure economics; it is because we want the prize of the good social outcomes and good social dividends that flow from good economic management, such as jobs and a good tax base from which revenue can be raised for hospitals, pensions and other public services.
       </p>
       <p>
        It'd be fair to say that most have done it tough as a result of COVID, and it's rewarding to see that the policy settings delivered for Tasmania by federal and state Liberal governments are now producing results. The latest unemployment figures show that Tasmania boasts the lowest unemployment rate of any state. Indeed, right now there are almost 4,000 more full-time jobs than there were last year. With an unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent, we have more Tasmanians in employment and an economy that can continue to grow and deliver. Indeed, on the other side of the ledger, the net operating deficit of $960 million is now scheduled to be some $157 million lower. Of course, lower debt means less stifling of the economy and, what's more, less mortgaging of the future of the next generation.

        In the CommSec
        <i>
         State of the States
        </i>
        report it is very, very clear that, out of the eight indicators, Tasmania rates first and that, out of the others, it rates in the top half each and every time. For the fourth quarter in a row, Tasmania holds the mantle of the best-performing economy. These things do not happen by accident. They happen as a result of good, sound economic management. For that I want to congratulate, firstly, Prime Minister Abbott and Premier Hodgman, who set the policy parameters when they were both opposition leaders and then worked together in a very united manner to ensure that the Tasmanian economy was able to be turbocharged. Prime Minister Morrison and Premier Gutwein continue to build on those foundations today to see the Tasmanian economy grow. What we see is that Tasmania remains Australia's best-performing economy. Tasmania leads the way in the area of equipment investment. If you move on to the other statistics, be they for unemployment or construction work, Tasmania is leading the way. Tasmania remains strongest on the relative population measure, with its 1Â½ per cent annual population growth rate.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are great figures coming out of Tasmania, and that translates into a good, sound economic future for my fellow Tasmanians. Tasmania has been very strong on dwelling starts, and the other indicators all speak for themselves. There was a time in Canberra when it was nearly embarrassing to admit that you were Tasmanian. People ask; 'What has Tasmania done to have such a vibrant, dynamic and resilient economy?' The answer's pretty simple: it is the shrewd stewardship of Liberal state and federal governments over the past few years that has delivered Tasmania the rightful reputation of being the turnaround state.
