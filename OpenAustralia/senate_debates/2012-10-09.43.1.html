         over 170 Syrians were killed yesterday, 160 were killed the day before, more than 30,000 have died and 1.2 million may have been internally displaced.

         estimates that 44 per cent of primary health facilities, 50 per cent of hospitals, are no longer fully functional. The tragedy is made worse by shelling, mortar attacks and rockets targeting hospitals, patients and medical staff. Half of Syria's doctors and nurses are no longer able to work. Volunteers with no medical training struggle to provide care. There is a shortage of equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
         I recently put forward a plan to protect access to medical care in Syria. It has three components: first, all sides to the conflict must agree to not target medical personnel or facilities and not block access to doctors and healthcare facilities; second, that third parties such as a non-government organisation could monitor implementation; third, more humanitarian aid. On 30 September, I announced a further $4 million for Syria, bringing our total contribution to $24.5 million and making Australia the third largest national donor. I have discussed this plan with the Joint Special Envoy for Syria and the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. The plan is not without its challenges. Neither the Assad regime nor opposition groups have demonstrated any willingness to abide by previous peace plan commitments. The opposition, as we all know, is seriously divided. There is an opposition within Syria; there is an opposition organisation outside the country. Monitoring will be very difficult. A recent report suggests that monitoring anywhere outside Damascus is currently entirely elusory. I am very proud by the way that Australia is such a significant humanitarian contributor to this terrible humanitarian crisis.

           Australia has an embargo on military equipment and assistance to Syria. This means it is illegal under Australian law to engage in fighting for either side and to fund, to train or to recruit someone to fight or to supply or fund weapons for any of the sides in Syria. This is appreciated by Syrian community leaders in Australia. On 13 September, I met with a delegation of community leaders, together with the ministers for home affairs, immigration and citizenship, and environment. These community leaders undertook to communicate this message to members of their communities in Australia: namely, that it is against the law to engage in fighting for either side—that is, Australians—to fund, to train or to recruit someone to fight or to supply or fund weapons for either side in Syria. Since April 2011, of course, the Australian government has advised against travel to Syria.

              Arab League

             , the United States and others. These sanctions restrict trade in key sectors for the regime, prevent military assistance and target individuals and entities associated with human rights abuses. We also must ensure that the conflict does not escalate any further or spill over into neighbouring countries. We know the alarm felt not only in Lebanon and Turkey but also in Iraq about the implications of this civil war, with all its sectarian overtones for their sovereignty and the safety of their people. I join others in calling for restraint from both Syria and Turkey following recent cross-border shelling, while confirming that we stand in solidarity with the people—
