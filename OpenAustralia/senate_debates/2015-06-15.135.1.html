         I thank Senator Williams for his question and commend him for the significant amount of work he has done on this issue. I am delighted to update the chamber on this very important issue. It has taken a coalition government to move to make changes to country-of-origin labelling. The Prime Minister announced on 26 February that the government will work to bring forward reforms to the country-of-origin labelling system that will be in the best interests of consumers. It was the Prime Minister who formed a working group of ministers to progress this issue. The working group includes the Minister for Industry and Science, the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Trade and Investment, the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
          Small Business
         </a>
         and me. It is this government that will ensure consumers have access to clear, consistent and easy-to-understand food labelling through changes that will allow for more informed choices.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has undertaken consultations across the country to hear input from industry, consumer groups, stakeholders and small to medium enterprises on what they believe the new graphic label and text should look like. The consultations were held in Darwin, Brisbane, Townsville, Launceston, Hobart, Melbourne, Albury, Armidale, Canberra, Perth, Adelaide, Mildura and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Heads" rel="nofollow">
          Tweed Heads
         </a>
         . We are working with industry groups to ensure the changes are practical, but the intention is to implement both a symbol and words that can be clearly read and understood. The symbol and words will identify two key things: firstly, that the product was made, grown or manufactured in Australia; and, secondly, what percentage—not specific percentages but increments—of the ingredients in a product was Australian grown. We are also looking to utilise electronic platforms to provide more comprehensive product information to consumers as only a limited amount of information can fit on food labels.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can inform this chamber that progress continues to be made. The government has begun the consumer and market testing consultation phase, including a community survey, so that everyone can have their say on this important issue.

           I am very pleased to update the chamber on the reaction to the government's announcement on changes to country-of-origin labelling laws. It has been extremely positive. AUSVEG stated in their media release on 9 June 2015:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We welcome the initiative from the federal government to gauge consumer attitudes on country of origin labelling reforms, as consumers have repeatedly called for meaningful changes …

           CHOICE stated in their media release on 9 June:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … the Federal Government’s call for consumer and community feedback is a great step towards creating a meaningful and clear country of origin labelling system.
          </p>
          <p>
           The National Farmers' Federation stated in their media release of 9 June:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … Brent Finlay has welcomed the Government’s commitment to improve the Country of Origin Labelling arrangements.
          </p>

           AFGC Chief Executive Gary Dawson has stated:

           We're working actively with the government on ways of simplifying the system ...
          </p>
          <p>
           This government's proposed reforms have strong support from community and industry.

             I can advise the chamber that we have also started discussions with state and territory governments, whose cooperation will be required in order to implement a meaningful new labelling system. I can advise that on 8 May 2015 the

             </a>
             Industry and Skills Council agreed in principle to support country-of-origin labelling changes. I am also pleased to inform the chamber that the Agriculture Ministers' Forum also agreed in principle to support country-of-origin labelling changes. The Australian government ministers committed in principle to improving the country-of-origin labelling framework and agreed to work collaboratively to progress the initiative. I can also update the chamber that I have put country-of-origin labelling on the agenda for the Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation, which I chair, for the meeting in July. I look forward to updating the chamber after the meeting. It is this government that is determined to introduce changes that will make it easier for consumers to identify locally-grown and processed food.
