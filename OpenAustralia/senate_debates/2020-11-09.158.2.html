        In respect of the ministerial statement on developing northern Australia, I move:

        I rise in response to the minister's statement to deliver a reply on behalf of my colleague, the shadow minister for northern Australia, Senator Watt. Labor shares the government's commitment to our nation's north. For decades, Labor has called for and supported its economic development, the protection of its fragile environment, the provision of quality health, education and other services to its people and the empowerment of our large
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        population. Unfortunately, though, in northern Australia what we've seen from this government is what we've seen in so many other areas—plans off in the never-never which take forever to get out the door. In this statement it is interesting to see the government is blaming COVID-19 and last year's bushfires for its lack of progress in northern Australia. In reality, the government was struggling to deliver for the north well before Australia had ever heard of COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of northern Australia have been waiting a long time to see the type of change that was promised. As the government admits in its statement, it still hasn't fulfilled all of the measures it announced five years ago. That's because the north Australian white paper is a prime example of what this government loves doing most—a big flashy announcement and zero follow-through. Five years on, the white paper must be gathering dust in the bottom drawers of an office somewhere. It's been slow progress for a plan that was supposed to mark the beginning of a new era of growth in northern Australia. Time after time, the government talks about the north's potential, but what it doesn't seem to understand is that people in the north are looking for action to realise that potential.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's easy to lose count of how many reviews and rehashes of programs the government has announced for northern Australia in the last few years. Ask someone living in the north: they don't want another announcement from this government; they want delivery. The north Australia white paper is the crowning jewel. Its big-ticket announcement was supposed to be the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        Infrastructure Facility, now widely referred to as the 'non-action infrastructure fund'. It has been a huge disappointment to northern Australia and Australians in the north. The government is always happy to talk about how much they have approved or how much they're going to spend from the NAIF, but they're dead quiet when you ask, 'How much has actually gone out the door and into communities?' There's probably a good reason why they don't like to talk about that.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's taken more than five years to squeeze out less than five per cent of the funding. Less than five per cent of every dollar promised for northern Australian projects has actually been delivered. This means it would take 116 years to finally complete the program if it kept going at the current spending rates. The NAIF has spent more on itself in administration costs than it has across all of Queensland: $10 million on job-creating projects, $31 million on itself. Not a single Queensland project north of Townsville has received a single dollar from the NAIF. The government has now given itself another five years to try and hit its funding targets, but communities in the north can't keep hanging on for funding to trickle down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor has been calling for major projects for the NAIF for three years, and finally, recently, we saw the Morrison government admit its failures and commit to a much-needed overhaul of the program. Money must start getting out the door faster so that it can start turbo-charging northern Australia's recession recovery. Communities in the north are some of the harshest hit by the economic fallout of COVID-19 and have been repeatedly let down and forgotten by the Morrison government. The decision to pull back JobKeeper support too early has hurt businesses and workers across northern Australia, particularly in areas like Cairns, Townsville, Darwin and the Kimberleys, which have been hit hard by the international border closures.
       </p>
       <p>
        With a bit of big-picture thinking and national leadership, northern Australia has a great opportunity to lead the way out of the COVID pandemic. The remote working opportunities that many of us have embraced during the COVID period have opened doors for many workers and businesses to expand beyond the city skyscraper. The work the state governments have done in the north during the pandemic has been tough. They've had to take tough decisions, but they have kept people safe and helped businesses to reopen to the customers on the doorsteps. This hard work was recently recognised at both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Queensland state elections, where voters backed in these decisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has always failed to follow through on its promises to create new jobs in the region. An article in the

        over the weekend revealed that around three-quarters of the NAIF's staff live in Sydney—about 1,400 kilometres from the southernmost point of northern Australia. We also recently found out that the government doesn't have a single full-time worker stationed in

        at the North Queensland Water Infrastructure Authority—not one. The authority has been operational for 18 months, and the best the government can do for the people of North Queensland is a team in Canberra, consulting on important projects for North Queensland, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_Gate" rel="nofollow">
         Hells Gate
        </a>
        dam, the Big Rocks weir and the Hughenden irrigation scheme projects. It's becoming increasingly clear that the Morrison government's northern Australia agenda is northern in name only. Perhaps, with that level of attention to detail, it shouldn't be a surprise that they had to scrap the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility, which failed to deliver a cent of its $2 billion fund. But, hey, at least they delivered the announcement. The ministerial statement makes it clear that all the Morrison government has delivered for northern Australia in the last five years since the white paper was launched is a series of announcements.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all want to see the northern parts of Australia flourish. A strong northern Australia is good for the whole country. But, at the moment, the federal government is unable or unwilling to make that happen. People in the north want more than platitudes about their potential and resilience. It's time the Morrison government got on with the job and started delivering real results for northern Australia, rather than just talking about it and doing nothing. Northern Australian people need better than this.

         I also rise to take note of the statement on developing northern Australia. I want to make a few remarks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week, the Joint Standing Committee on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         was up in the Pilbara with regard to the Juukan Gorge destruction. I'm not going to comment on that, because that's the subject of a report that will be coming out in the next two weeks of sitting. However, it is related to why I want to comment on this statement. What's very significant about the statement is that, under 'Partnership with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         ', it says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Working in partnership with Indigenous Australians lies at the very heart of northern development.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we heard about last week when we were talking to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         peoples, and, in fact, it's what we've heard when we've had other hearings in the Juukan Gorge inquiry, is the impact that mining is having on First Nations peoples in the Pilbara, on the traditional owners—their inability to get onto country. You've got First Nations peoples and traditional owners having to ask permission from mining companies just to go on a camping trip on country. They have to give the companies 48 hours notice, and then someone turns up with a key and lets them onto to their own country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week, we heard that one of the Aboriginal corporations was spending 80 per cent of its revenue on governance. We delved further into that issue, and it's actually about mining and clearance, about heritage clearances for mining. So 80 per cent of the royalties that they get is spent facilitating mining on country that they have to ask permission to get onto now. So you have these mining companies and the government saying, 'Aboriginal organisations and First Nations peoples make money out of mining because they get royalties.' But here's this corporation having to spend its royalties to facilitate yet more mining, which will exclude them from more country. You've got First Nations people being denied access to important sites because there's rail access nearby, and therefore they can't enter that country—because of the rail easement going through. How is this 'working in partnership with Indigenous people'? It isn't.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course we all know about what happened to Juukan Gorge. We all know that there are 100 other sites that are currently covered by section 18 development applications. Many of them are in northern Australia. The government, both state and federal, is not doing anything to stop those section 18s going ahead. Yes, we have draft changes to the heritage act in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , but those sites are still under threat. So you have those sites under threat and, once you get a section 18, mining companies take them off their plans so they can't see them as a site anymore. You have people being denied access to their country more and more. That is not a partnership. That is continued occupation of land by mining companies and pastoralists. First Nations peoples come down the bottom when it comes to being able to get access to their land.
        </p>
        <p>
         Things need to improve. We need to completely relook at how mining is allowed to occur on First Nations peoples' country so that they are not kept off that country. You can't even go for a camping trip. It is having an impact on people in the Pilbara. Go and talk to them. We need to acknowledge that this is not the way that we should be doing business in Western Australia or anywhere in the north of Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
