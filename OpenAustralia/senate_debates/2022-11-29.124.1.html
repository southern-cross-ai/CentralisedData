        MBIE () (): My question is for the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Minister Wong. Last week it was revealed that the Chief of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        , General
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
         Angus Campbell
        </a>
        , has given officers of Special Operations Task Group 28 days to provide reasons why they should not have to return any honours they received throughout their service in Afghanistan. This order applies to officers of the ranks of captain and brigadier. It excludes officers of the rank of major general. How convenient. One officer of the rank of major general who was in the headquarters responsible for the Special Operations Task Group, who received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Distinguished Service Cross
        </a>
        for his service, was the now general, Angus Campbell. Does the minister support there being one rule for the higher-ups and one rule for the rest?

         This obviously goes to the implementation of the Brereton report, which contained 143 recommendations, many of which were resolved by the previous government. The Deputy Prime Minister has instructed Defence to detail a pathway for closing out the remaining 42 recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the outstanding recommendations is the one referenced in Senator Lambie's question, which deals with the review of the award of decorations to those in the command positions of troop, squadron and task group level during particular Special Operations Task Group rotations. I am advised that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of the Defence Force
         </a>
         has written to a small number of people. Obviously I don't propose to comment on the outcome of each of those particular considerations. I would make the point that the government's focus is on implementing the Brereton recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the last part of your question, Senator Lambie, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, Mr Marles, has stated that there is no cause to extend the parameters of the recommendation, and where the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
          CDF
         </a>
         has acted it is because there is an evidence based reason to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government remains committed to ensuring that the outstanding recommendations of the Brereton report are appropriately acted upon. I'm advised the CDF is seeking to do that where there has been a detectable pattern of behaviour underpinned by credible reports of misconduct by ADF personnel in Afghanistan. I'm also advised this applies to a very small number of people.

           The Office of the Special Investigator is investigating soldiers, while the higher commanders are protected by what the Afghanistan Inquiry Implementation Oversight Panel calls 'a blanket exemption from liability'. Given the extent of the findings that have led to this punitive action, does the minister believe this blanket exemption remains appropriate?

            I do acknowledge Senator Lambie's ongoing focus on not only these issues but the issues of the welfare of serving and previously serving personnel. The focus of the government and, I'm advised, the

            is to implement the Brereton report recommendation. The parameters of those recommendations were obviously a matter for the Brereton report. As I said, the Deputy Prime Minister has stated that the government does not believe there is cause to extend the parameters of the recommendations.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are committed to implementing the report to the fullest extent possible. We understand this is a difficult issue, but one that the

              Minister, the blanket exemption has been criticised on both its grounds and its effects by a number of well-credentialled experts in this space. If the Chief of Defence Force can decide to demand the return of medals, who has the authority to decide whether to demand the return of his?

               The advice I have is that a defence honour may only be cancelled by the Governor-General. The process in relation to any such cancellation would be that the relevant minister would make a recommendation to the Governor general to cancel such an honour.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, again, I make this point—and I don't intend to get into personal reflections on anybody: the government's view, and the

                CDF

               's actions are consistent with this, is that the recommendations of the Brereton report should be acted upon. CDF's actions are consistent with the government's policy position.
