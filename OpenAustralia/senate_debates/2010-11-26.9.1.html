        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The speech read as followsâ€”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a very important bill, because it is about trying to assist Australians who are casualties of overseas terrorism.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have seen on several major occasions now how the Islamist terrorism of the past decade has touched ordinary Australian citizens.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         World Trade Centre
        </a>
        on September 11 there were Australian victims; tragically, in Bali in
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2002 and again in 2005 there were Australian victims; and in London, and twice in Jakarta, there were Australian victims.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All up, over the past decade more than 300 Australians have been killed or seriously injured as a result of terrorism.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In some cases, Australians became casualties because they were Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If we take the second Bali bombing: the bombers went to that beachside restaurant in Bali precisely because they knew there would be Australians there.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In other instances, of course, it was because they were citizens of the West generally or in Western cities,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through the bill we are debating I am proposing a national scheme, analogous to the state victims of crime schemes, to facilitate financial assistance for persons who suffer injury as a consequence of terrorist acts overseas or for the next of kin of those who are killed by terrorist acts overseas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am not proposing a massively costly scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Using the average of 30 victims per year we have seen over the past decade, it would cost the Commonwealth government about $2.25 million per annum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If there is any responsibility of the federal government, it is surely to protect and look after Australians who get into trouble abroad.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That should include those Australians who are victims of terrorism.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
