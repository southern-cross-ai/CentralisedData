        My question is to the Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Arts, Senator Coonan. Will the minister advise the Senate of progress in the development of the government’s media reform proposals? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Ronaldson for his continued interest in media policy. As senators on this side of the chamber are aware, the government is well advanced in canvassing options for reforming Australia’s media. On 14 March 2006, the government released a discussion paper on potential media reform which proposed a number of options and a comprehensive framework for media reform in Australia. Over 200 submissions have been received in response to the discussion paper, and it has been the subject of some extensive commentary in the media and elsewhere. One factor that nobody would deny is that traditional media services are constantly being challenged by new digital technologies. These technologies are emerging at a phenomenal pace, laying the ground for new players, new content and new delivery platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consumers are already taking advantage of a wealth of new sources of information and entertainment, and most media organisations are looking at how they can meet these challenges. From the government’s perspective, the impact of digital technologies means that the current regulatory settings, which are largely designed for an analog world, require review. In a new digital world, spectrum is no longer a scarce resource. The discussion paper proposes a range of measures aimed at introducing new and innovative services in the near future and gradually relaxing regulatory restraints on the industry by the end of the analog-digital simulcast period. This package will enhance the benefits for consumers in a digital environment and at the same time provide industry with certainty and stability. I have always said that the interests of consumers are paramount in these reforms, and I am particularly mindful of ensuring that consumers continue to have access to locally relevant news and information programming, regardless of any changes that may take place. There is no doubt that consumers value live and local services.
        </p>

         The government’s settled framework on media reform will be developed very shortly, following completion of my consultations and consideration of the submissions. Interestingly, Labor has set out to be critical of the government’s approach, even though, so far as I can tell, it has no developed policy of its own on media. This is a very broad-ranging and complex policy area, and I make no apology for the consultative approach or for being focused on benefits to consumers. This is in stark contrast, as Minister Vanstone mentioned a moment ago, to Mr Beazley, who it appears does not even consult with his own ministry when deciding to backflip on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">

         reforms and rip up Australian workplace agreements. On media, Labor is trapped in the past, fighting yesterday’s battles and trying to hold back the tide of technology in an old analog world. The government will continue to work patiently through the issues and deliver a sensible, well-thought-out framework for the future.
