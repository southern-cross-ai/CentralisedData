       <p>
        Hear ye, hear ye! My Lord, Lady and Lieges: I am shocked and horrified that people are ridiculing the bold and inspirational leadership of the people's Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Abbott of Warringah.
       </p>
       <p>
        While some may claim that returning to knighthoods is taking the country backwards, I can think of no more important policy for our realm right now, because reform does not simply stop at backing bigots. No, friends: this is a Prime Minister with a vision for the future. This is a Prime Minister with a passion. This is a Prime Minister with a broadsword in his hands. While there are those who claim this is simply a policy designed to win votes in the marginal seat realm of Australia west, I reject this outright. With Holden and Ford already leaving, the carriage industry is a growth sector this government is prepared to embrace. I do not want to send the bazaars into a flurry, but rumours abound that Dame Gina Rinehart is prepared to supply the shields, armour and weaponry. What a boost to the West!
       </p>
       <p>
        And, my friends, there are on-water matters as well. The free trade agreement the government is currently negotiating with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India" rel="nofollow">
         East India
        </a>
        trading company is going to open Australia to spice markets unseen for a generation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Friends, let me be clear: together we will stop the moats. In the past few days, I have consulted my economic round table and can categorically state that, by adopting this policy, dozens and dozens of pounds can be saved. I was excited to hear that ministries, in addition to knighthoods, will now be determined through a jousting tournament in the caucus room. Senator Bernardi from the realm of Australia South, whose jousting skills are lacking, confirmed that this has actually been the case for some time.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, friends, all is not wellâ€”for an ill wind doth blow. My good friend Senator Sinodinos of the realm of South Wales New is currently facing the Inquisition. Despite what the court wizard may say, I believe he will float and be returned to the court forthwith.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need a leader who will reject climate change, who knows the world is not warming. Friends, we need a leader who knows that winter is coming, for all of us know that we are living in the time of the Game of Tones.
