                Tragically, more than 457 aged-care residents have died from COVID-19, and there are now more than 951 active cases in residential aged care. A 77-year-old St Basil's resident who did not contract COVID-19 died after suffering dehydration and malnutrition which accelerated her dementia and led to her death. Doctors have described her situation as a case of neglect. How many Australians have died in aged care this year not as a result of COVID-19 but as a result of neglect?

                 It is quite tragic that Labor seek to try and play politics with the passing of senior Australians in residential aged care. There are about 60,000 Australians who die in residential aged care on an annual basis unfortunately, but that's one of the functions of residential aged care. I don't have statistics on—

                    Direct relevance: I asked this minister how many Australians have died as a consequence of neglect in the context, particularly, if I may say, of the report entitled
                    <i>
                     Neglect
                    </i>
                    handed down by his royal commission. If he's not able to answer the question, could he take it on notice?

                     I'm listening carefully to the minister's answer. In my view, if he is talking about people passing away in aged care, he doesn't have to adopt the terminology or the assumption of the question but he does have to limit himself to that particular topic to be directly relevant. I think he is at the moment but I will listen carefully. Senator Colbeck.

                      As I was saying, we all acknowledge that there are things that need to be improved about the aged-care sector in this country. That's why we're having a royal commission. That's why one of the first acts of this Prime Minister, Prime Minister Morrison, was to call a royal commission. I've heard Labor MPs trotting around this place over the last few days claiming that they supported it when they didn't, including then leader Mr Shorten.

                       I have a point of order on direct relevance. How many Australians have died in aged care this year as a result of neglect? It is a reasonable question. I'd ask the minister to return to it.

He was addressing very directly that this is not a question that can be answered in the way that Senator Wong is seeking for political reasons.

                           The motive of a particular question is not for me to make an observation on. There are times to debate it. Senator Wong, I would normally have pulled the minister up on the royal commission issue, but you did raise it in your previous point of order, so I was giving him some discretion to deal with that point that was raised. As I've said before, if the minister is confining his answer to the passing away of people in aged care, then he is being directly relevant. I'm listening carefully, and he seems to be, so I'll call on the minister to continue. Senator Colbeck.

The whole purpose of our system is to provide a system that is supportive, that provides a high quality of care, and this government clearly has an ambition to improve that quality of care. That's why we're undertaking the process that we're currently undertaking.

                               The government, since January, have worked closely with the aged-care sector firstly on preparedness and then we have resourced the sector in that preparedness. We've continued to provide oversight of the sector to ensure that they are prepared but also, if they're not, that additional measures are put in place, and that's what this government will continue to do. The Labor Party can play its political 'gotcha' games all it likes, but we will continue to do exactly what we have done today in announcing additional resources and measures to support the sector as it works its way through the COVID-19 pandemic.

                                  What I will continue to do and what the government will continue to do is follow the medical advice and provide the systems and the resources that are available to the aged-care sector so that they can manage the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that senior Australians get the care that they deserve. That's what we've done in Victoria by partnering with the Victorian government to establish the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre, and that's what we've done today through the announcements that I've made along with the minister to ensure that the sector has the resources that it needs.
