        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to the cabinet revolt over the Prime Minister's plan to strip Australian citizens of their citizenship and the Prime Minister's refusal to confirm that a full cabinet submission has gone to cabinet.

             Senator Wong, you do speculate a lot and erroneously about process. It is rather—I am bound to say—like hearing Satan denouncing sin to be lectured by you about proper cabinet process.

                If it hurts your feelings, I withdraw it. Senator Wong, we have been witnessing with fascination on the ABC for the last two Tuesday nights what proper cabinet process was for the government of which you were a member—a litany of chaos and dysfunction that went on for six years.

                   I was about to say, unlike the chaos and dysfunction which characterised the cabinet of which Senator Wong was a member, all decisions by the Abbott government are made through an orthodox and proper cabinet process—every single decision.

                  <p>
                   Since you raised the matter about what we propose to do about dual citizens who are engaged in terrorist conduct, yes, you are right, Senator Wong. As the Prime Minister has announced, we will be introducing legislation next week to strip dual citizens of their citizenship in circumstances in which they are engaged in terrorism. We look to the Labor Party, from whom we have had uncertain signals, to support us. We look to the Labor Party to support us because this ought to be bipartisan. Australian governments and opposition parties ought to join together to take all appropriate measures to keep Australians safe. Rather than playing politics with national security, Senator Wong, rather than engaging in ill-informed and erroneous questions about process, get behind the objective.

                    , I have a supplementary question. I refer to the Prime Minister's confirmation that the final legislation to strip citizenship from dual Australian citizens will not be considered by the full cabinet. Does the Prime Minister mistrust his cabinet colleagues so much that he is planning to bypass his cabinet and go straight to the party room?

                                 , I have a final supplementary question. I refer to the Prime Minister's promise: 'Cabinet government and the Westminster tradition will always be maintained under my prime ministership.' With the Prime Minister bypassing his ministerial colleagues and his cabinet, and with his cabinet leaking like a sieve, can the Minister representing the Prime Minister advise when Mr Abbott decided to junk this promise too?

                                  —whether they support the Australian government's attempts to keep our country safe. We are not encouraged, I might say, by some remarks that came from the shadow Attorney-General at a press conference this morning when asked about this legislation. He was asked by Kieran Gilbert:

                                  Get them back—that is what the shadow Attorney-General would do. That is the point of difference. If somebody is fighting for ISIL in Syria, we do not want them back and we will make sure they do not get back. But Mr Dreyfus wants them back.
