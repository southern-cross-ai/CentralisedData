        My question is to the Minister for Defence, also representing the Minister for Trade, Senator Payne. My question is about your government's plan to provide a six-fold increase of weapons and defence technology sales from Australia by lending almost $4 billion of public money to the defence industry.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a government that has cut humanitarian aid, which saves lives, to the lowest level in our history, and it is now seriously discussing the merits of becoming a major weapons manufacturer and exporter …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government says this is an export and investment opportunity—but we would be exporting death and profiting from bloodshed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, do you agree with Mr Costello? And, if not, why not? Is he right or is he wrong?

         I respectfully disagree with Mr Costello on this matter, although we have worked together in the past on a number of issues. Let me be very clear about what is in the Defence Export Strategy. It builds on the government's very strong defence industry policies by setting out a comprehensive system to plan, to guide and to measure defence export outcomes. What we are doing is bringing together all the levers that are available to government and to industry to provide end-to-end support for defence exports, from building export readiness to identifying export opportunities, and, ultimately, to realise defence export outcomes. We are also establishing, through the strategy, the Australian Defence Export Office within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         , which will provide a focal point for defence exports. The strategy is also creating a Defence Export Advocate, who will support the office by providing ongoing, high-level advocacy for defence exports. They have not yet been appointed but they will be a senior figure with strong knowledge of the Australian defence industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         So what we have committed to—and I emphasise that this is all structured within the defence trade control system, which already applies strongly to what we do when we observe our obligations under that system—

                The senator asked me if I agreed with Mr Costello and I said, respectfully, no, I do not. What we are engaged in is, as I said, managed within the defence trade control system. Our export control provisions reflect our international obligations as a member of global non-proliferation regimes and as a signatory to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_Trade_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
                 Arms Trade Treaty
                </a>
                , and are consistent with like-minded countries. We assess all of our exports against five criteria: international obligations, human rights, regional security, national security and foreign policy. One of the challenges for defence industry in the past has been a lack of consistency—

                   I would refer the senator to the 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement, which was launched by the government in February 2016—so he has had almost two years to turn his mind to that—which set out our plans in relation to development of defence industry in this country, recognising it is a fundamental input to capability. The export strategy developed by the

                   , the Minister for Defence Industry and me is a significant next step in that process. What the Efic facility does, which the senator has referred to, is to take up Efic's significant experience in complex, large-scale project financing and, as a national interest account facility, while Efic will do the due diligence, the loan structuring and the administration, all final loan decisions will be subject to cabinet approval. And I reiterate: they will all be considered under Australia's rigorous defence export control provisions.

                      I have already made reference to our quite stringent defence export control provisions, but I can refer to those again if the senator wishes. The assessment of the application considers the goods or the technology, the way it will be used and who it will be used by—the end user. It also includes looking at the risk of it being diverted to another end user. All exports will continue to be assessed under Australia's export control provisions.
