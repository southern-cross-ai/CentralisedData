        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. The campaign to retake Mosul has now entered its sixth month. Given the recent reports of casualties in areas of west Mosul which are densely populated, can the minister update the Senate on the campaign to defeat Daesh in Iraq?

         I thank Senator Fawcett very much for his question. The Iraqi security forces are making steady progress in the campaign to retake west Mosul, but it is a very difficult operation which is made more complex by the dense urban environment and, frankly, the desperate actions of Daesh. Daesh's actions have further complicated the operating environment in west Mosul and heightened the risk to civilians. Daesh's desperate tactics, for which they have been condemned by the Iraqi government, include trapping residents in their own homes to prevent them from leaving the city and using them as human shields. Ground forces remain under direct attack from Daesh fighters, who continue to threaten the civilian population and are absolutely determined to maintain their hold over the city. Coalition air support remains necessary to enable the Iraqi security forces, including the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service, to clear Daesh out of Mosul.

         defence personnel operate under strict rules of engagement designed to protect our forces, minimise the risk to civilians and comply with Australia's obligations under international law. Prior to any air strike, the Australian Air Task Group undertakes a detailed and robust process that includes approvals from both Australian and Iraqi authorities. I am aware of allegations that a coalition air strike in west Mosul on 17 March resulted in civilian casualties. Based on the information that is currently available to us, I am advised that Australian strike aircraft were not involved in the air strike in question. As you will appreciate, it takes time to fully determine the details of a complex incident like this involving multiple aircraft from multiple nations. The ADF takes all allegations of civilian casualties seriously. If an allegation is raised following an

            Indeed, Australia continues to make one of the largest contributions to the counter-Daesh campaign. As I mentioned in my previous response, the Air Task Group, which comprises our F/A-18 Hornet strike aircraft, our E-7A Wedgetail intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft and the

            building partner capacity mission, providing training to Iraqi security forces in Taji. To date, more than 20,000 Iraqi trainees have graduated since training began in May 2015, including over 3,000 police trainees more recently, and there are currently more than 1,400 trainees conducting this important work. Additionally, the Special Operations Task Group, which comprises up to 80 ADF personnel, continues to provide advice and assistance to the Iraqi

               (—) (): In addition to our military contribution, the Australian government is also working to stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters in and out of Iraq and Syria and to stop the flow of funding to terrorist groups. As fighting escalates in Mosul, we are very cognisant of the threats posed by the link between Daesh in Iraq and Syria and South-East Asia. I discussed this with my Indonesian counterpart in our recent meeting and I raised it at the counter-ISIL defence ministers meeting in Brussels in February. This government is working closely with our partners in the region to address this threat. We have, for example, an agreement with Malaysia to share intelligence on returning foreign terrorist fighters. We are also supporting the Philippines so that they can contribute to counterterrorism, share intelligence and stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters. We are also mindful of the humanitarian disaster in Syria and also in Iraq. Since 2011, Australia has contributed almost $500 million to support not only those who are directly affected by the conflict but also those countries around Iraq and Syria who are hosting large numbers of refugees.
