        DIAC is also preparing a more detailed instruction for all DIAC staff in Australia and overseas relating to handling possible requests, in person or verbally, for asylum in Australia from persons claiming to be foreign diplomats or consular officials and persons claiming to be employed by a foreign government. The instruction includes advice on the privacy and confidentiality obligations of all DIAC staff. The instruction will be finalised in consultation with the Department of Foreign

        The committee recommends that DIAC take immediate steps to ensure that all officers are made aware of their confidentiality obligations under relevant legislation and conventions.

         In developing this response, the government is mindful of the extensive material provided to the committee in the course of its deliberations, including the then

          Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

         ’ (the department) submission of August 2005 (containing some 56 pages) and response to a request by the committee to address specific witness allegations arising out of the committee’s inquiry, forwarded to the committee secretariat on 5 December 2005 (111 pages). The government notes that in furnishing this earlier material, the department extensively covered the broad range of issues raised and provided clarification about its processes and operations.

         It is mindful too of the position taken by the government Senators on the committee, in that they were unable to agree with either the analysis or findings of the majority Report and expressed the view that the majority Report is substantially flawed by a biased and highly selective use of the evidence presented during the committee’s inquiry.

        <dd>
         The government Senators pointed out in their dissenting report that much of the material provided by the department on 5 December 2005 to deal with material critical of it was not included in the Report. They drew attention to the key elements of the government’s reform programme announced since the Palmer and Comrie reports as they felt that these had not been adequately addressed in the majority Report of the committee.

         The government has made a significant investment in the department’s reform and improvement programme. Around $780 million in new and redirected funding has been committed. The new Budget measures announced on 9 May 2006 were informed by a number of departmental reviews that were recommended by Mr Palmer in his July 2005 report. These included reviews of business information requirements, IT platforms and governance, records management, the detention services contract, long term detention health services delivery, detention infrastructure and compliance activity. All of these reviews pointed to the need for further changes if the department is to meet the expectations placed on it.

         By far the largest portion of the funding provided to the department in this year’s Budget – nearly half a billion dollars - is for Systems for People. This substantial programme of work will deliver the kind of support departmental staff need to do their jobs properly. It will provide better data quality, a single view of a client’s dealings with the department, less fragmentation of information and data, more flexible systems all of which mean better decision making. There is also a commitment of $42.5 million over four years in the Budget to support risk based compliance strategies, including deterrence and prevention and quality assurance measures. $22.6 million of that sum will be used to increase case management resources and implement a national case management framework. The framework will ensure that cases involving vulnerable clients with exceptional circumstances are managed in a fair, lawful, reasonable and timely way.

         A major initiative to complement the case management approach is the implementation of the community care pilot in Sydney and Melbourne announced by the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in May 2006. The pilot, which is being delivered in partnership with the

          The Secretary
         </a>
         has made it clear to departmental staff over the past year that their job is to implement change and improvement and deliver the government’s migration, multicultural and citizenship policies. This depends on careful planning, strong leadership and good administration. Also, longer term planning is being informed by comprehensive staff and client surveys. Much of that work has now occurred and the department is well advanced in developing a new planning framework for 2006-07 and beyond, underpinned by a strong framework of values and an articulation of the kind of behaviours expected of leaders in the department.

         The Secretary has regularly written to a large number of key external stakeholders to update them on progress and seek their views on issues. Formal feedback sessions have been held with groups of clients and the feedback shows that while it has a long way to go in achieving excellence in client service delivery, there are reports of more positive experiences in recent times. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs recently launched a client service improvement programme in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         . This brings together the many strands of work being undertaken to ensure much better client service is provided. This programme develops themes of “our commitment, our presentation, helping you and hearing you”. The Secretary reported earlier this year on the outcomes of the first all-staff survey in many years. The survey pointed to concerns about image, leadership and client service, all of which are being addressed.

         Legal and Constitutional Committee at the Budget Estimates hearings on 22 May 2006, the Secretary stressed how the department is absolutely determined to perform professionally, lawfully and reasonably. Its key themes of being an open and accountable culture, having fair and reasonable dealings with clients and well trained and supported staff are crucial to its future. It has listened to criticism, is learning from mistakes and is very much focussed on improvement. A detailed document was tabled by the Secretary at the 22 May Hearing showing progress on implementing the Palmer programme.

        As explained below, the concept ‘dob in’ usually refers to persons alerting migration officials to overstayers or illegal workers. Given that the recommendation is in the context of people who are seeking protection visas it is noted that protection visa decision makers have clear instructional guidance, in the Protection Visa
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedures_Manual" rel="nofollow">

 The Procedures Manual also sets out the arrangements to be followed in disclosing personal adverse information to the applicant to enable them to respond.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The existing National Compliance Operational Guidelines advise departmental officers who have collected dob-in information that regardless of the source, all information received must be verified. The guidelines instruct officers to verify information received by checking departmental databases, locating client files and previous applications, contacting overseas posts, conducting checks under section 18 of the Migration Act, conducting police checks, and conducting observations of an address of interest in order to ascertain the resource requirements of the operation, to verify the accuracy of the information and to assess access and containment issues.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The MSI states that while generally a visa holder is entitled to know the substance of allegations or claims about them and have the opportunity to respond to them, sometimes information provided to the department by a person such as a dob-in caller may be non-disclosable information if the person asks the department that the information be treated in confidence and the delegate agrees that the information should be treated ‘in confidence’ or it can be inferred from the circumstances that the information should remain confidential. A breach of confidence may lead to legal proceedings against the department.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This instruction also advises officers that if information cannot be disclosed to a visa holder because it contains non-disclosable information, the delegate may give little or no weight to the information, release part of the information, or use the non-disclosable information to obtain other evidence which can then be put to the visa holder.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under all of these disclosure arrangements the identity of the person providing the information would normally be treated as confidential.
