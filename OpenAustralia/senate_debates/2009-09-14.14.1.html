        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Minister Evans. Does the Labor government accept any responsibility for the surges in asylum seekers attempting to enter Australia unlawfully?

         The Rudd Labor government takes its responsibility for combating people-smuggling absolutely seriously. We are doing all we can to try and combat the evil trade of people-smuggling. We believe that excision, mandatory detention and offshore processing of irregular maritime arrivals on

             In the 2009 budget an additional $654 million was dedicated to a whole-of-government strategy to combat people-smuggling as part of the government’s $1.3 billion strategy to strengthen national security and border protection. We have established a dedicated Border Protection Committee of cabinet to drive the whole-of-government strategy to combat people-smuggling and to ensure that the government’s efforts are fully coordinated and resourced at levels which enable us to quickly respond to the factors that contribute to irregular people movement. The Rudd government has also created a single point of accountability for matters relating to the prevention of maritime people-smuggling within the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Customs
             </a>
             and Border Protection Service. These new arrangements will create a more effective capability to analyse intelligence, coordinate surveillance and on-water response and, of course, engage internationally with source and transit countries to comprehensively address and deter people-smuggling throughout the operating pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Labor government are absolutely committed to try and combat people-smuggling. We are working closely with Malaysia, Indonesia and

             </a>
             to deal with what is an increasingly large number of people seeking asylum and moving through South-East Asia. It is a problem that we have come together to tackle under a rejuvenated Bali process, as all countries in the region recognise the challenge people-smuggling makes to us.

                Senator Cash condemns the Liberal Party out of her own mouth with her question. She says the recent number of arrivals is all the Labor Party’s fault. Then she says, ‘Put your faith in us because we have an alternative policy. We have a call for an inquiry. We have a policy that says, “We want an inquiry.”‘ That is very courageous of you. It is a very important contribution to national debate. We are not proposing an inquiry because we are proposing to continue strong action to try and combat people-smuggling. We are absolutely committed to the task at hand. We have committed more resources. We have reinvigorated the Bali process. We are doing all we can to deal with these challenges. I do not think an inquiry is an alternative policy or any—

I would like to give you a chance today, in taking note of answers, Senator Cash, to ask: does or does not the Liberal Party support the ending of the Pacific solution?
