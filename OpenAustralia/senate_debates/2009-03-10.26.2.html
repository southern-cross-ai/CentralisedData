         Thank you for that question. As this government has said in being honest and straightforward with the Australian public, Australia is being buffeted by international financial circumstances. As we have said consistently, we are better placed than almost all other countries to cope with this. The last national accounts figures speak for themselves. The

          IMF

         forecasts consistently come with the proviso—the same as the

It is no wonder that that former Treasurer has the word ‘former’ in front of his former title, because this was a completely irresponsible position to take. Those opposite have sought to play cheap politics when what this country has needed is swift and decisive action. In November, we put forward the

              , I ask a supplementary question. As Senator Conroy obviously had some difficulty in answering the first question, could he try this one. The government’s Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook forecasts that 300,000 more people will be unemployed by next financial year. Given that the

              contracted by half a per cent in the December quarter 2008, will the government now revise its unemployment forecasts?

               As we made clear when we produced the recent UEFO forecasts—we actually produced and brought forward new, updated forecasts, which is somewhat unusual; it has not been done by many if any other previous governments—all the risks are on the downside. We could not be clearer. We could not be trying to hide anything. We could not be clearer than that. We have been engaged in a rigorous process to give as much information to the Australian public as it has been possible to do as the economic collapse around the world has occurred. We continue to be forthright and honest with the Australian public about the magnitude of the international crisis. There is no

Now that, clearly, the economy is going backwards on the Rudd Labor government’s watch, will the government now admit that its December $10.4 billion cash splash failed to create the promised 75,000 additional jobs and was a waste of taxpayers’ money?

                 Despite the claims of those opposite, including Senator Coonan here today, there is evidence that the Economic Security Strategy released last year, which those opposite voted for, has boosted consumption. Don’t let the facts get in the way of any economic truth for those opposite! The retail trade figures for the month of December released recently show our Economic Security Strategy has delivered a very solid boost to consumption at a time when our economy desperately needed it. The December retail trade figures show that retail sales increased by 3.8 per cent in December. To put this in context, this is the biggest monthly increase since August 2000. Can you imagine the do-nothing approach from those opposite, their ‘say we’ll support something one day and oppose it the next day’
