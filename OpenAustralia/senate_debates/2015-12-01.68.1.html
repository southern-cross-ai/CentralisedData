         I thank Senator Bushby for his question, which is a very important issue for the nation but especially for Tasmania in terms of having confidence in the quality of our teachers and confidence in the literacy and numeracy standards that are taught to our children.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Turnbull government is providing new measures, in cooperation with the states and territories, to give confidence in the capabilities of our teachers in their own literacy and numeracy standards and therefore their capacity to be able to teach and appropriately deliver a good literacy and numeracy education to our children. Our government provided the opportunity, as part of our reforms, for up to 5,000 students to voluntarily sit the new test that we are applying across all initial teacher-training education graduates across nine centres: Perth, Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra, Ballarat and Albury. This test is an opportunity for students to demonstrate that they are in the top 30 per cent of all Australians for literacy and numeracy standards. Importantly, from next year, it will be a compulsory part of graduation for any student and will therefore be available right around the nation, including, of course, in Tasmania.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we have seen from these initial results is that some 92 per cent of those involved in teacher training at university passed the literacy component of the test and 90 per cent passed the numeracy component of the test. While these are pleasing pass rates, it demonstrates that our universities have a way to go to ensure that every single graduate completing a teacher training program at university is within that top 30 per cent band for literacy and numeracy. To do so will give us confidence, and, most importantly, will give parents, principals and the community confidence that our teachers are up to standard and can provide the requisite literacy and numeracy skills and training to students to ensure they have the basics for an excellent education into the future.

           The government recognises that the quality of teachers is the single most important in-school factor in determining student outcomes. Yes, there are many other factors that are critically important that our government is focused on—parental engagement and the quality of the national curriculum—but, within the classroom, it is the calibre and quality of the teaching that matters most.
          </p>
          <p>
           Back in 2011, education ministers from around Australia agreed that teaching graduates should meet this top 30 per cent benchmark for literacy and numeracy standards. However, sadly, the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group independent review the government undertook demonstrated that this was not necessarily being met. So this new measure, the mandatory test, which will ensure that, from 1 July next year, all students undertaking teacher training in universities must pass this test, therefore guarantees that they will meet the minimum 30 per cent standard. It will guarantee to parents, principals and others that they have teachers in the classrooms who are capable and competent in literacy and numeracy.

             This complements the record funding that our government is delivering to the school systems right around Australia. It complements what we have done in the new national curriculum that will apply from next year. It complements our parental engagement strategy. All of this comes together with our new teacher quality agenda to give schools, principals, education authorities, and, most importantly, parents, families and the community greater confidence in what is happening in the classroom and for literacy and numeracy outcomes of students around Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is an important benchmark to set. When it comes to what our teachers should have, and their capabilities and competencies within the classroom, the top 30 per cent of Australians for literacy and numeracy is not an unreasonable expectation. The vast majority of our teachers do an outstanding job, but it is critically important that we ensure public confidence in the teaching profession because, by having such excellent standards, we will then attract even better students into the teaching profession in years to come. I am confident these reforms will help to enhance the reputation of our teachers around Australia.

              My question is again to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Attorney-General's previous answer to my question in which he claimed not to recall any conversation with the Minister for Justice in relation to the execution of a search warrant on Mr Brough, the

                  because, you have, in the course of that question, both misquoted me and misquoted Mr Keenan. Your question to me was whether I was advised by Mr Keenan before the warrant was issued, not in relation to the issue of the warrant but whether I was advised before the warrant was issued, and I said I have no recollection of such a conversation—and I have not.

                        , I ask a supplementary question. I reiterate the question in the primary question: when and how did the justice minister so inform the Attorney-General? And how many other conversations has the Attorney-General had with the justice minister about the execution of search warrants on the homes of ministers in the Abbott-Turnbull government? How about a non-lawyer's answer?

You do owe me an apology and you owe the Senate an apology. You asked me a question about whether I was advised before the warrant was executed. I was advised of it after it was executed, which is the ordinary procedure—

                                     , I rise on a point of order. Senator Cameron used most unparliamentary words in abuse of Senator Macdonald, and I ask him to withdraw.
