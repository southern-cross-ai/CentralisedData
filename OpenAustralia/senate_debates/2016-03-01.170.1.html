        Tonight, I rise to provide condolences to the family of the late Kevin James Driscoll
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBE" rel="nofollow">
         OBE
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBE" rel="nofollow">
         CBE
        </a>
        , who passed away on 27 February 2016, aged 88. I would like to talk about Kevin Driscoll's larger-than-life character. He was hardworking and had an absolutely sharp intellect. He was a businessman whose individual contributions to the nation can be tracked not only across this great nation but across almost every sector of our industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born on 10 July 1927, Mr Driscoll's childhood certainly remains a bit of a mystery to me. All I know is that he was the son of a Singer sewing machine salesman. Perhaps Kevin learnt a thing or two about business from his dad. In 1955, at age 28, Mr Driscoll went into business and earned his financial stake in the building and construction industry. Specifically, Mr Driscoll's company National Homes Pty Ltd was tasked with building houses in Queensland mining towns. Mr Driscoll worked his way up the building industry and became the founding President of the Queensland Home Builder's Association, which later merged with the Queensland Housing Industry Association. In this combined organisation, Mr Driscoll fulfilled the role as president until he was elected National President of the Housing Industry Association in 1966.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1968, Mr Driscoll's leadership in implementing improved housing standards across the country earned him a life membership of the Australian Housing Industry Association. Mr Driscoll's contributions to the housing industry were then recognised by the federal government, and his expertise was sought to head up the Australian Housing Corporation from 1972. Mr Driscoll's innovative and distinguished contributions to the housing and construction industry led to him being recognised and awarded an Order of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">

        in 1980 and a

        in 1987. Mr Driscoll's knack for making absolutely sound business decisions placed him in very high esteem. Through his membership of the Companies and Securities Advisory Board from 1989 to 1996, Mr Driscoll helped to guide the federal government's business policies of the time. Mr Driscoll held various other board positions over his lifetime, including director of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Expo" rel="nofollow">
         World Expo
        </a>
        in 1988 and deputy of the Lang Park Trust, which some people would know as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncorp_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Suncorp Stadium
        </a>
        , from 1991 to 1995. He was an original member of the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation, and, most commendably, a board member of the Prince Charles Hospital Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, I would like to personally acknowledge for the record Mr Driscoll's contributions to the nation in my own portfolio space, Indigenous Affairs. In 1998, Mr Driscoll became the Chairman of the Business Enterprise Committee of the Indigenous Land Corporation. It was in this role and as one of the longest serving directors of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILC" rel="nofollow">
         ILC
        </a>
        that Mr Driscoll guided the corporation towards a profitable livestock and pastoral investment. He used to delight in being able to say, because of his personal knowledge in the pastoral industry, 'I'm taking these particular types of bulls, I'm going to send them out to the ILC properties in different places.' He was very much a hands-on director. Much of the herd and the infrastructure are there today as a consequence of his involvement—the resulting profits of which are being reinvested into local economies, providing for employment, training and educational opportunities for Indigenous people right across regional and rural Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Driscoll's business expertise and insightful purchase of property led to his own personal wealth creation over his lifetime. Mr Driscoll purchased a total of seven cattle stations and eight hotels across Queensland through his lifetime, resulting in many employment and economic development opportunities for the surrounding communities. However, out of all Mr Driscoll's lifetime achievements I would take a guess that his most cherished were the hearts of his wife, Thelma—the daughter of another distinguished businessman, Sir Leslie Thiess—and their four children. Our thoughts tonight go to Mr Driscoll's family following his recent passing. Mr Driscoll's intellect, capacity and drive were an asset to the nation, and he will be remembered. Vale, Kevin James Driscoll.
