Has the minister or the Minister Assisting the Minister, Mr Combet, met with representatives of the Insurance Council of Australia or the insurance industry to discuss the home insurance crisis facing the 1.1 million Australian homeowners who participated in Rudd Labor’s disastrous Home Insulation Program?

            I thought it might be useful, given I have been asked what the minister has done, to refer to what the minister has done. He has indicated in his statement that there has been some media reporting about home insurance for people who have had their house insulated. The minister has indicated that he is advised that the Insurance Council of Australia is not aware of any cases where an insurer has refused insurance due to the installation of insulation under the Home Insulation Program. In relation to one case, which has been the subject of media reporting today—15 March—suggesting that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRMA" rel="nofollow">
             NRMA
            </a>
            refused to insure houses that had insulation installed under the program, the minister has referred to the fact that an NRMA spokesperson has confirmed it was not the policy of the company to ask questions about the installation policy as part of any risk assessment process.

              That is probably a question, Senator Abetz, that should be addressed to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRMA" rel="nofollow">
               NRMA
              </a>
              . In regards to their own insurance policies, the minister has indicated that households should consider their personal individual circumstances and make informed decisions regarding their personal situation. Obviously, the specific circumstances in relation to insurance will depend on the nature of the householder’s insurance policy, on the circumstances of installation—that is, who did it, whether they did it correctly and according to appropriate standards—and if they provided a warranty. The minister has also indicated that it appears that the case that was reported in the media today was in relation to a household which requested and received a phase 3 safety inspection.

From the discussions that Minister Combet has clearly had with the insurance industry, can the minister give an assurance that no homeowner who participated in the Home Insulation Program will be left without appropriate insurance coverage in the event that they suffer from an insulation related house fire?

                   . I will just repeat what I was saying: as I previously indicated, the minister has advised that the Insurance Council of Australia is not aware of any cases where an insurer has refused insurance due to the installation of insulation under the Home Insulation Program. I think that the advice given by the Insurance Council is clear. I am not sure that I can add to it in terms of what the status is under relevant insurance policies, which appears to be the direction of the question.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. The minister indicated in the original answer, and again in that one, that with individual insurance policies there may be the matter of question as to whether homeowners would be covered in the event they have a home insulation fire. What comfort is there to homeowners who are not part of the ‘lucky’ 15 per cent who will get random audits that their home will still be covered in the event that they suffer from such a fire?

                     , I am not sure how much of a supplementary that is.

As I was saying, in relation to the audit process and inspection process, I have previously outlined in this place the way in which Minister Combet is approaching that issue in relation to both foil and non-foil properties.
