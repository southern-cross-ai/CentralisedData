           Thank you, Mr Deputy President. The coalition supports
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day" rel="nofollow">
            World Mental Health Day
           </a>
           . We tried hard to make this motion a cross-party affirmation of the key principles behind the day, including pointing out that Labor had got the wrong theme, however the motion before us is a cynical, self-promoting exercise by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
            ALP
           </a>
           and their Green alliance partners. Our objection is the paragraph asserting that the so-called mental health reform package has received support from across the parliament. This is simply not the case. There is widespread criticism by mental health experts of the lack of real action by the government and, most especially, of its draft 10-year road map. This is nothing more than a wish list with very little detail and all the hallmarks of the never-never so typical of everything Labor promises.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is not surprising that this road map has been heavily criticised by mental health experts who have gone on the public record to register their serious concerns. The reality is that one in five Australians need help now, not a 10-year timetable which has aptly been labelled as a road map to nowhere.
