        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. Minister, the Independent Communications Committee chaired by Mr Allan Hawke has found that the government's $22 million
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        advertising campaign is in breach of the guidelines on information and advertising campaigns. Mr Hawke's advice of 13 June said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        is concerned that running the proposed national campaign in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        may not fully comply with Principle 4 of the Guidelines, specifically the need for campaign information to clearly and directly affect the interests of recipients.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee considers that the need to run the proposed campaign advertising in Western Australia at this time requires a specific and strong justification given there is not currently a negotiated agreement to co-fund and implement the DisabilityCare scheme in that state.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is the government defying the advice of Mr Hawke and breaching its own advertising guidelines, and will the government now cease the advertisements in Western Australia?

         I thank the senator for his question. When we were elected in 2007, this government committed to cleaning up the taxpayer funded spending spree that was the Howard government's system. We have delivered on that commitment. When we were elected, this government was faced with a system that had next to no independent oversight and no integrity. Before Labor introduced the Independent Communications Committee there was simply no scrutiny of government advertising. Labor introduced tough guidelines which governed the content and presentation of campaigns, removed ministers from an active role in campaigns and significantly reduced costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Advertising is driven by the legitimate need to inform the public about their rights, their entitlements and their obligations, including advertising for: the census campaign; ongoing

          Quit Smoking
         </a>
         and on obesity and illicit drugs; and the digital switchover. We have increased reporting requirements and, unlike the Howard government, we have set out exactly how much taxpayer money is spent on campaign advertising.

                    , I ask a second supplementary question. Isn't the public entitled to be a little cynical about the government's intentions in spending $22 million between now and August, including $7 million over the next 10 days on advertisements with little information about a scheme that will not be completed for another seven years?

                      alone over just three weeks in October 2005. For the fifth year in a row, the government has spent over $100 million less than the $254 million that was the Howard government's advertising spend in 2007. We will continue to spend significantly less than the Liberal-National coalition. When those opposite stand up they do not have any credibility whatsoever. You just have to think back to the outrageous misuse and abuse of taxpayers' funds that the Work Choices campaign represented. Do not just sit there and snigger, Senator Sinodinos. I know you had left the building by then, but—
