        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Just last month, the minister said:

        last week, the Prime Minister warned of 'an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy'. Was the Prime Minister referring to the

         I thank Senator Kitching very much for the opportunity to refer, at some length, to the Prime Minister's speech to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowy_Institute" rel="nofollow">
          Lowy Institute
         </a>
         , because it is convenient, of course, to read selective quotes from a significant set of remarks, but I think it's important to take them in context. If you were to take them in context—which is not convenient for the opposition—the Prime Minister made a number of observations. For example, he observed:

        <p class="italic">
         We have entered a new era of strategic competition—a not unnatural result of shifting power dynamics, in our modern, more multi-polar world and globalised economy.

           The question was very simple. It was whether or not when the Prime Minister warned of 'an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy,' he was referring to the

            I'm listening carefully to the minister's answers. I believe it is directly relevant for the minister to be answering the question by referring to other contents in that very speech. I think that is directly relevant and a narrower construction than the word 'relevant' would imply.

I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing for a Prime Minister to do. He also talked about the changes and the impact they have on Australia on a number of areas—on our jobs, on our environment, on our safety and on our freedom. Our freedom—

They need to be considered together. Selective quoting is convenient for the opposition, but it's not accurate and it's not truthful and therefore it's not unexpected from them.

                                      The Prime Minister warned against 'negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill-defined borderless global community'. Can the minister advise the Senate which international agreements Australia has signed up to involuntarily?

                                       I don't believe there's any reference or implication in the Prime Minister's remarks that indicate signing up to international agreements involuntarily. What the Prime Minister does say is that globalism needs to facilitate. It needs to align. It needs to engage. It needs to do that, rather than direct and centralise, because an approach of that nature can corrode support for joint international action. I think it's fair to say that in 2019 we are at peak commentary from those opposite and from multiple sources around the world. We are at a point or an inflection in time where peak commentary is the way of the world. Trying to navigate a clear path through that in the national interest is what you should expect your Prime Minister and foreign minister to do, and that is what we are doing.

                                          I think the most important thing that the Prime Minister was referring to is exactly what I just said. As the speech says, we need to have institutions and we need to have an approach to globalism that facilitates, aligns and engages rather than directs and centralises. I don't think that is a provocative statement to make. I think it is a considered statement by a Prime Minister who is taking a serious engagement in matters of international relations and foreign affairs.
