        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrell" rel="nofollow">
         Farrell
        </a>
        . I welcome the statement made by both Minister Farrell and the Minister for Finance this week in relation to the stage 3 tax cuts, which was: 'The policy we took to the election was that those tax cuts remain, and our position has not changed.' Can the minister outline to the Senate why the Albanese Labor government is so committed to implementing the stage 3 tax cuts that will cut taxes for hardworking Australians?

         enator FARRELL (—) (): I thank Senator Bragg for his question. I suppose the simple answer, and the most direct answer to your question, is that this issue was discussed in the shadow cabinet before the last election. There was debate about whether we would originally support or oppose the tax cuts. Of course, we took a decision as a shadow cabinet to support the tax cuts and we took that position to the last election. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is nothing if not a person who honours his commitments, so he took that policy—

          No, they weren't looking worried. They're all happy. They're looking very happy there. They're looking happy because it's Friday; it's the end of the week.

          it's Friday! We can get out of here, we hope. Look at all those happy faces. Like me, they know that Prime Minister Albanese is a man of his words and he took that policy to the Australian people, just as he's doing in a whole range of other areas, like child care, aged care—you name it. There's electricity, putting downward pressure on cost of living, of course. He's—

             I thank Senator Bragg once again for his question. I guess it's pretty obvious that, after 10 years of neglect in this area from the then government, this issue of bracket creep continues to be a matter of concern for Australian taxpayers. Like everything that the Prime Minister does, he's all about looking after Australian workers. Of course, in the same way that he's putting downward pressure on electricity prices, helping people with their childcare costs, assisting aged-care workers, this Prime Minister is committed to looking after Australians, making their lives easier, not harder, and that's—

               <p>
                Thank you, Senator Bragg, for that second supplementary question. It is rather self-evident, I would have thought. If an Australian taxpayer receives a tax cut then it's rather implicit in that they'll keep more of the money they earn. I find it difficult to understand why you would have difficulty with that concept. I certainly don't. When a person who's on a particular rate of tax gets that tax rate reduced, that gives them more disposable income. Surely, Senator, you understand that? I can see you're smiling and acknowledging—
