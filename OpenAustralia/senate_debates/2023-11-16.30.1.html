              Trans folks in our community put up with an awful lot. They are attacked on a daily basis. They are attacked for who they are as humans. Their very existence as people is called into doubt by extremist fascists who are transphobes. The amount of rubbish that you see just on social media, on an unprotected platform, is appalling. We are not going to facilitate providing parliamentary privilege to those kinds of people. Trans rights are human rights.

Such inquiries are conducted all the time, because they're essential to the legislative process. The Senate is open to denying a bill due process, so the question must be asked, why?

                     Childhood gender surgery, whether physical or chemical, is not an insignificant matter. It is life changing, often life ending and irreversible. When young gender transitioners realise that it is irreversible and they regret their decision, that can often lead to them choosing suicide, to end their life. Billions of dollars of taxpayer money is involved. More importantly, the lives and health of tens of thousands of Australian children are at risk. There's no room to vote this matter on feelings or fear. We need to get the facts. Gendered identity surgery on children relates to their physical health and to life itself.

                    <p>
                     I appreciate that there are those even on the conservative side who refuse to question childhood gender surgery. That's their right. Australians are increasingly asking why there is a cover up. Who are you protecting? I have received representatives from constituents from many different states approaching this issue from many different perspectives. Whenever

                     has brought these perspectives to this place we have been shut down. That is not democracy. That is not the exercise of Senate powers without fear or favour; it is the complete opposite. It is control and shutting down. It is censorship. I have promised my constituents I will bring their perspectives to this place, and I will never take a step back from doing that fairly and honestly.

                     The public have turned against causing chemical and physical mutilation and harm to children in the name of gender identity. The Senate will have to deal with this issue in the near future, so let us do it now. Let us get on with the job. Send this bill to a committee and let Australia contribute to the debate. Let parents have their say. Let victims of childhood transition have their say. And, yes, let trans people have their say. I point out, that all that is done by this bill that I co-sponsor with Senator Antic and Senator Babet is found mainly in section 8. It prohibits doctors prescribing surgery or puberty blockers to people under the age of 18. That's all it does. A health practitioner—

                        <p class="italic">
                         A health practitioner must not knowingly provide gender clinical interventions to a minor that are intended to transition the minor's biological sex as determined by the child's sex organs, chromosomes, and endogenous profiles.

                          's intervention, I think it's very important to put on the record that Senator McKim refused to engage in any of the actual details that are included in this bill. Senator McKim—through you,

                           Madam President

                          —gave a speech around very broad generalisations of rights without in any way tackling the major issue that Senator Antic is bringing to this chamber, which is a matter of political controversy around the world. That is the simple question of whether minors—children—should be able to receive life-altering surgery or pharmaceuticals before the age of consent. That's all it is. I think that is a perfectly legitimate question to ask, because there is no more important thing we can do in this chamber than to protect children.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We have to be very clear here. I will just briefly go through some of the details of what is actually happening at the moment, rather than making accusations that different senators are reprehensible, deplorable people. What is actually happening right now is that young children in Australia are receiving pharmaceutical interventions that have not been approved or assessed for the use they're being put to. In particular, there's a chemical called Lupron, which is a TGA-approved drug for testicular cancer. It's been approved for use mainly by adult men who are afflicted with testicular cancer. It has not been approved or assessed by the TGA for use by children. There has been no assessment of that, yet in gender transition clinics in our country it is being used for minors. That is allowed to be done because it's an off-label use. It's being prescribed within the TGA's approved limits, but it's an off-label use.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Some observant senators might remember that there's been some controversy about off-label uses in recent years. People who had the temerity to use ivermectin for COVID, for example, were completely and utterly abused, with people saying that it was absurd and that it hadn't been tested for COVID. Here we have a drug that has not been assessed or tested for use in minors but is allowed, with little oversight, to be used on minors in Australia. Given the grave risks involved in it being applied to minors, I think it is only right and proper that we have an assessment of whether or not this is the right path to go down. There are no refunds for the children that might be afflicted by these pharmaceutical or surgical interventions. It's very hard for anyone to reverse the changes that are inflicted by these chemical interventions. I would have thought the Greens political party, more than any others, would understand the notion of the precautionary principle. Surely we should be very cautious about rolling out these types of interventions when we do not know what their long-term ramifications are because they haven't been assessed by a proper medical trial yet. They are being used in an effectively unregulated fashion.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Finally, there is nothing unique about our parliament or Australia looking at these issues in depth, given the controversies we've seen overseas. Many would know about the Tavistock clinic in the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
                           UK
                          </a>
                          , which has been shut down by UK authorities because of the evidence that damaging and life-altering surgeries and other interventions were conducted on children. There was a long assessment of that institution in the UK, and, following that, it was shut down. Unfortunately, because this debate is being hijacked by those who prefer insults to debate, we are not having a similar assessment of the ramifications of what is occurring in our country on this issue. This bill gives us an opportunity to do that. I would encourage other senators to vote for this. Whatever views you have, what is there to hide here? Why are we trying to hide away from any parliamentary assessment or oversight the impacts on our children? It is far time we conduct this inquiry. I commend Senator Antic for bringing this to the chamber, and I hope that we can have an inquiry into a matter that is affecting the lives of children in this country.

                           I want to make a very brief contribution. I want to associate myself with the comments that Senator Canavan has just made and to make this point in addition: this is simply a referral to a committee. Senator

                            McKim
                           </a>
                           raises some concerns about it opening itself up to hurtful and hateful adverse reflections that presumably could come from submitters to that inquiry. The committee has processes and the powers to deal with submissions that would cause harm to people.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I think it is entirely appropriate for this issue to be referred to this committee to be looked at and to be examined. I note that the Greens actually chair this particular committee, the Community Affairs Legislation
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
                            Committee
                           </a>
                           . That committee has the capability to be able to deal with adverse reflections and, of course, provide protection if it was necessary. I think this is a sensible reference of a bill. It's an important bill that's worthy of debate, and this motion should be supported by the Senate.

                            I commend Senator Antic and Senator Roberts for bringing this to the chamber. I've tried on three separate occasions to have a hearing into this, an inquiry into it, and it was blocked every time. The fact is that it is exactly right.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I commend the Greens for standing up and fighting for koalas and fish, salmon, and different things. But we're talking about humans here. We're talking about our children—about protecting them and their rights as well.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            We have seen in television interviews and even on
                            <i>
                             Insight
                            </i>
                            , when they did a story on this, what happened to children—absolutely distraught, sorry that they went through this whole process. We've seen it, as Senator Canavan said, with Tavistock, and we've seen it around the world. This has become a business at the expense of children's lives being destroyed, and that's what we need to consider.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Why I pushed my notice of motion to have an inquiry on this is that a group of mothers, half-a-dozen mothers, went knocking on the doors of members of parliament and senators to explain to them why it was important to have an inquiry into this. These are mothers, parents, who have seen their children go through this process and become—what can I say? They don't lead normal lives anymore. One mother said that her daughter now, who is 21, is in her bedroom for three months at a time. She will not come out of her bedroom. The mother has to leave her food at the door. She doesn't want anyone to see her because she's changed from a female to a male after taking these puberty blockers, the hormones that she needed to change. She's now got hair on her chest and hair on her face, and she's balding. She is absolutely distraught. It's destroyed her life. She said, 'All we need is to let people hear our story and understand what is happening in our community.'
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Another reason why it's important now is that the Labor Party just passed their family law, and, under family law now, you can give all rights to the custodial parent, so the other parent no longer has a right or say in the health or wellbeing of the child. Parents have lost their rights here as well. You've given control of it to only one parent.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I just feel that this is so important. People in the gallery are listening to the debate here. Australians, our job here is to give people the right to have a voice. If it goes to an inquiry, then we can hear what the people have to say and make an assessment of that and how we best deal with this. People are sick and tired of being shut out—that they don't have a say. It's important that we do this. And I am disgusted by those on the coalition side who have not voted on this or who stay out of the chamber because they do not want it to be seen how they vote on this. It is not about an individual. This is about doing what's right.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            In the criminal amendment bill the government wants passed today, they are worried about the drugs coming in from China through vaping. They're worried about the drugs that children may be taking through vaping. What about the irreversible drugs that are being given to children? Puberty blockers are irreversible, and that's what people won't admit. They don't want to say that. That's why it's so important to have this inquiry. I'll tell people: this has become a money-making business.

                            , there was only one clinic. Now there are 300 across the whole country. It's estimated to be a $200 billion industry, at the expense of our children. That's what needs to be discussed here.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            If you really worry about lives and about drugs, let the inquiry happen. What are you hiding? What are the Greens hiding? Why don't they stand up for Australians on this? Why don't they stand up for the children? That's what this is about. I cannot understand Labor's stance on this and why they are so opposed to the people having a voice. That's what it's about: the people having a voice. I will appeal to those on the coalition side, those half a dozen who haven't voted or who voted against this as well. Put it in an inquiry. Let the people be heard. It's no skin off your nose. That's what our job is. You must stand up for everyone in this nation. So I call on people. Let the people have their say. The people should be heard. You know what? Outside this chamber, we went to a referendum on that. The people had their say. We allowed the people to have their say as far as the Voice went, but we're not allowing the people to have their say—

                             I rise to speak in support of referring the Childhood Gender Transition Prohibition Bill 2023 for inquiry by a committee. We have an age of consent in this country for drinking, smoking, driving and voting, because we acknowledge that children are too young to make decisions. The impacts of gender-changing surgery for a child can last a lifetime. I think it's incredibly hypocritical that we have rules for our children to protect them yet we don't have rules and regulations on this and we do not want to scrutinise why we allow these changes to occur on a permanent basis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The other reason why I think it's very important to look at this is the right of parents and how much say they have in regard to decisions that their children make. I've been contacted myself, as I know fellow senators have been contacted, by many parents who are distraught about the changes that have been inflicted upon their children, some of whom later decide that they made the wrong decision. I think we need to give them a voice as well.
