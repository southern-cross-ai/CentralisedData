        shows that Australia has suffered the largest reduction of real household income amongst all developed nations. The Albanese
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_government" rel="nofollow">
         Labor government
        </a>
        has presided over a 5.1 per cent reduction in per capita household income. Not only did this Labor government reduce household incomes by 5.1 per cent; two-thirds of developed nations actually grew their per capita income in the same period. Spain wins the gold medal for economic management, with a six per cent increase in income. Meanwhile, in Labor's 'socialist republic of Australia', the real wages of everyday Australians have gone backwards to the same level as they were in 2009.

       <p>
        Labor governments somehow sell themselves to the electorate as being the party of the worker. Not anymore. Labor is selling out Australian workers with your net zero climate change scam, driving power bills up and driving employment opportunities down. Labor is selling out workers by allowing 2.3 million visa holders into the country, many of whom will cost Australia more than they will ever contribute, while driving down real wages. Labor is selling out the workers with your digital-prison legislation which is currently before the Senate. This will ensure that workers who want to keep a bank account—how novel—won't be able to complain about having no job, no home and no future. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is jetting around the world, enjoying the largesse of nations to which we've surrendered economic advantage. It's the

        world tour of shame, complete with an appropriate and highly patronising canine reference from China that I will not repeat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyday Australians are going backwards while corporate profits are at a record high. This is not the government of the workers. The Prime Minister's billionaire mates are running a government of wealth and advantage for parasitic billionaires who feed off taxpayer subsidies. The workers party is now
