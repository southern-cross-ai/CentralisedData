        My question is to Senator Gallagher, representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care. The Tavistock gender clinic in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , a leading provider of gender dysphoria services, will close in 2023. Britain's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service" rel="nofollow">
         National Health Service
        </a>
        asked Dr Hilary Cass, past president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College" rel="nofollow">
         Royal College
        </a>
        of Paediatrics and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Child Health
        </a>
        , to review the treatment of children with gender dysphoria. The Cass review found that Tavistock gender clinic has failed vulnerable children, and it recommended closing Tavistock. Finland, France and Sweden have taken the same decision for their gender clinics. Here in Australia, Melbourne's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Children's Hospital
        </a>
        has many links with Tavistock. Minister, will you review Australia's gender clinics to ensure that these clinics are not causing the same harm to vulnerable children that the Cass review found at Tavistock?

         As the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, if there is further information I can provide after question time, I will do so. I would say that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Children's Hospital
         </a>
         has an excellent reputation in paediatric care in Australia. It is staffed by world-renowned medical professionals providing first-rate care to younger citizens in the state and also around the country. I don't have close knowledge of the services they would provide to children with gender dysphoria, but I have no doubt that they have the professional standards and the professional skills that are required to provide those young people and their families with first-level advice and health care.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have no information available to the government, to my knowledge, that we should see it any differently to that—that is, that where there are children who require health services they access them through a children's hospital; that those services are accredited, there are professional standards in place and there are appropriate ethics and various advisory bodies that inform the delivery of those services; and that if there are concerns around them they are dealt with through the appropriate channels—not necessarily by politicians, who have particular views about certain things, but actually through the delivery of health services—as we do in a whole range of other areas of paediatric care.

           OBERTS () (): So you can't say whether you will review? Evidence shows that the use of puberty blockers sterilises children, and the impact on brain development is unknown. The

           is currently studying the impact of puberty blockers on children. We are literally offering a treatment we do not know is safe. Minister, when will the Australian government intervene and demand the closure of all gender clinics in Australia until gender treatment in children is proven to be safe, if ever?

            The government has no intention to intervene and ban particular services, health services, that are supporting families and supporting children to access the type of care that they need for their individual situation. If there is further information I can provide—and I would say, as a former health minister, that health services in this country, and we are very fortunate, are heavily regulated. The professionals who provide health services are heavily regulated. There are professional bodies in place, there are complaints mechanisms, and there are a whole range of avenues, if there are concerns about any health service, that those would go through and be dealt with. They are not normally dealt with on the floor of a parliamentary chamber.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many families that need services. The Australian government is about providing health services, not taking them away.

              listens to people and this is what we're hearing, so we speak up for constituents. Minister, a child who has not even reached puberty is incapable of knowing their own mind. Doctors, and sometimes parents, are taking these decisions on the child's behalf. Has the government considered the legal liability it is incurring for the government's part in this medical malpractice?

               Well, I don't agree that it's medical malpractice; nor do I agree with the proposition being put forward in the question, which is that there are professionals and parents making decisions that are harmful to young people. Perhaps, Senator Roberts, it might be good for you to go and ask the health professionals who are providing these services how they provide them and how they support young people, rather than just taking a particular view. I've always found that going in and asking questions and being open-minded—not necessarily just taking one individual's view about it but actually learning from the health professionals—is useful.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also think saying it's medical malpractice goes too far. When we're looking at the vulnerability of the young people and children who are needing this kind of support through the health system, we should be very sensitive in how we deal with it, and as a government we're keen on making sure that we are able to provide health services to anyone who needs them, regardless of their circumstances.
