         (Australian Labor Party, Leader of the Government in the Senate) |
         <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;orderBy=_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;page=0;query=Dataset%3Ahansards,hansards80%20Date%3A1%2F11%2F2011;rec=0;resCount=Default" title="The source of this piece of text">
          Hansard source
         </a>
        </small>
        <p>
         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Navy prepares its fleet units to specified levels of readiness in accordance with guidance from Government through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
          CDF
         </a>
         . Not all units are maintained at the same level of readiness.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Those fleet units held at higher readiness for short notice operational roles are appropriately manned, equipped and trained for the tasks that they might have to perform. Fleet units at lower readiness will also be crewed in a manner that is best suited to their assigned tasking which includes maintaining core skills currency and training throughput. This might mean the reduction in certain trained/skilled positions filled in order to make way for additional trainees. Fleet units invariably go to sea with all available accommodation filled.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To meet and sustain operational, exercise, preparedness and training requirements, fleet units are operated in a cycle of scheduled maintenance, training and operational availability. Planned major maintenance activity periods are a routine element of the operational cycle.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Henceforth, and in order to provide a consistent means of reporting to correctly encapsulate the manner in which ships and submarines are managed as a fleet to meet operational preparedness, Navy intends to apply the following basic definitions upon which future unclassified responses to questions relating to the general issue of operational status of naval vessels.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Within Operating Cycle
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A ship, submarine or unit when conducting assigned tasks and undergoing scheduled maintenance, including external maintenance and docking refits, in accordance with the vessel's designed servicing and support plan: this is referred to in Navy as the designed Usage Upkeep Cycle (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUC" rel="nofollow">
          UUC
         </a>
         ). This includes alongside periods dedicated to planned activities such as crew reconstitution, and maintenance and repair work which was pre-planned for the work package to be undertaken over the period designated as routine maintenance consistent with the vessels UUC.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Outside Operating Cycle
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A ship, submarine or unit undergoing maintenance that is not in accordance with the vessel's designed servicing and support plan, the Usage Upkeep Cycle (UUC). This includes those periods in time when unscheduled maintenance requirements arise either through growth in a refit work package, or through unscheduled maintenance, which requires either an extension to the existing maintenance period, or results in a new maintenance period, for a period longer than that vessel's assigned operational readiness notice. A vessel will also be classified as non-operational where any other issue arises for which the vessel is subsequently unavailable for operations within its ascribed readiness notice. Examples include circumstances where an operational pause has been invoked for safety reasons or where insufficient skilled personnel are available to crew a vessel within its UUC.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Private Briefing Opportunity
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The definitions provided are considered appropriate for an unclassified forum. Providing a more detailed breakdown of this data beyond these levels of fidelity in the public domain is considered inappropriate as it would allow insight into the Royal Australian Navy's overall Fleet preparedness posture. Navy is prepared to provide the Senator with a private briefing on the more specific aspects of overall Fleet preparedness between 1 January and 30 June 2011.
