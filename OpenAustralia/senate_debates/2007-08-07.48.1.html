        released its Report 66 Review of treaties tabled 7 December 2004 (4), 15 March and 11 May 2005 on 17 August 2005.

 The Committee made three recommendations in that Report about the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).

 These recommendations are addressed below.

         Response

       <p class="italic">
        As detailed in the National Interest Analysis, the Australian Government is confident that Australia meets all of the mandatory requirements of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC).

 The Attorney-General’s Department consulted with relevant Australian Government departments and agencies and with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
         States and Territories

        , and determined that no new legislation is required.

        <b>
         Recommendation 2
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Attorney-General advise the Committee in writing that the Australian Government has no intention of using the external affairs power and the United Nations Convention against Corruption to pass legislation which has not been foreshadowed in the National Interest Analysis.

         Response

        The Australian Government does not intend to use the external affairs power to pass additional legislation to implement the UNCAC.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The only domestic change that was necessary to implement UNCAC was to make regulations under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth) and under the

 These regulations give effect to the extradition and mutual assistance obligations in UNCAC.
