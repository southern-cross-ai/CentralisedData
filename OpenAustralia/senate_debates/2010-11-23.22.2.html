        2. President, I ask a further supplementary question. The lease answers the question: the minister did direct the proponents to have this project at James Price Point unless they could show a commercially viable alternative, which was not to be the case. I ask the minister: what is the point of the Commonwealth undertaking to protect national

        On 6 February 2008, in accordance with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act

         LNG
        </a>
        precinct to service Browse Basin gas reserves This strategic assessment requires all potential environmental, heritage and social impacts to be fully assessed including an analysis of technically and economically viable gas processing options outside the Kimberley.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The site selection process was conducted by the

         Western Australian Government
        </a>
        as the first component of the Strategic Assessment. The process considered more than 40 sites and involved consultation with Indigenous communities, environmental scientists, marine experts, the public, environment groups and industry. On 23 December 2008 the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I understand that the Strategic Assessment report is now being finalised and will be released shortly. There will be further opportunity for public comment on the proposed LNG precinct when the strategic assessment report is released.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities will make his decision on whether or not to approve development of an LNG precinct at James Price Point only when he is in possession of a full and comprehensive suite of information and once satisfied that the requirements of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC Act
        </a>
        and strategic assessment terms of reference have been adequately addressed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There will be no Kimberley LNG Precinct at James Price Point unless the proposal meets all of the environmental requirements, including under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The conditions placed on the retention lease renewals are explicit in having the Browse Joint Venture undertake all necessary work as part of the Strategic Assessment to enable that process to be finalised, and the Minister to make his decision, unless an alternative development option is put in place which would not utilise the Kimberley LNG Precinct.
