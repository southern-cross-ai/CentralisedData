         Thank you very much indeed, Senator Muir. That is a very important question. Obviously the government is studying and will study all current and future reviews whether the coronial inquiry, the departmental review or other reviews that have followed in the wake of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Place" rel="nofollow">
          Martin Place
         </a>
         siege. One of the measures that the government has undertaken is the National Firearms Agreement, which does set out a national approach to the regulation of firearms. The Firearms and Weapons Policy Working Group, comprising members of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and policing agencies, is currently considering technical updates to the National Firearms Agreement as a result of recommendations made in the Martin Place siege review. Any recommended updates will aim to strengthen and streamline firearms regulation by addressing technological advancements and changes to the firearms market that have occurred since the National Firearms Agreement in its initial form was signed in 1996.
        </p>
        <p>
         Relevant stakeholders will be consulted throughout the process including those from the firearms community and other appropriate groups and organisations. I can tell you, Senator Muir, that my department has established a firearms industry reference group comprising peak bodies from the firearms industry to provide advice on the update. Ministers, relevant police ministers and attorney-generals from all jurisdictions will consider the updated version of the National Firearms Agreement in November.

          , I rise to ask a supplementary question. I refer you to the recent statements by Senator Fifield to the Senate in response to the notice of motion in relation to firearms on 13 August this year. Does the government intend to trigger a buyback of all lever-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of five rounds or more that are currently legally registered as a category A firearm in Australia?

           The Minister for Justice made some announcements in relation to that a couple of weeks ago. The government does regard lever-action firearms as a serious matter. I will provide you with further particulars of the details of that scheme. But be in no doubt that this government, like the Howard government before it years ago after the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur" rel="nofollow">

           massacre, is determined to take whatever measures are necessary in relation to firearms to keep the community safe. That being said, of course we will have regard to the legitimate and proper interests of all stakeholders including recreational firearms users.

            , I ask a final supplementary question. Should the review of the technical elements of the National Firearm Agreement cause the reclassification of any firearms currently lawfully held by licensed firearm owners, will the government commit to funding a nation-wide buyback of any firearms that are reclassified?

             It is an in interesting issue you raise, Senator Muir. I am not in a position to make that commitment now but we will take into account and consider what you have had to say.
