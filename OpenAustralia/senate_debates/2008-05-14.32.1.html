          I will explain why I think the government should be supporting these amendments. This is a definition issue, and I am a little surprised that the government opposes these. If you look at the integrity of this process, these amendments, which seek to clarify and change the definition from ‘carrier’ to ‘eligible carrier’, make absolutely perfect sense: for only those who are involved in this process to be given the opportunity to participate in the details and the provisions of this particular bill. In my view, it would be totally unreasonable for carriers, in the widest sense, to have access to sensitive commercial information, which they could have quite simply by giving some indication that they were dealing themselves into the process. Were they to do that then they would have the opportunity to get access to that information. I think that for the integrity of the process, and to address and to firm up those matters that the minister is seeking to address in other parts of the government’s amendments and in the bill itself, this would be an entirely appropriate group of amendments to be accepted. I think that it would provide for those that I am sure the minister is hoping will be active participants in this process, to actually enable the tender process to have integrity and a large number of players. I would have thought that, considering the quickest way to ensure that they were active participants in this process and indeed that this matter would be dealt with expeditiously in line with the government’s own July deadline, you would want to maximise the confidence of those who will be legitimately tendering by indicating to them that the integrity of the process will be maximised, not undermined, by the definition of ‘carrier’ versus ‘eligible carrier’. I would encourage the government to review the decision to oppose this because I think it does actually support the integrity of their own bill.

               The opposition opposes these amendments. I am mindful of the time that is left open to us. We oppose amendment (4) because we believe that our amendment (9) is far stronger, superior and comprehensively deals with the voluntary protected carrier information. We are probably dealing with a bit of them together.
              </p>
              <p>
               Had the integrity of the process in relation to the voluntary information been included in the first place, we probably would not have needed this bill because that would, on its own, have provided the integrity of the process that the minister was trying to attain. That is why we have argued from day one that this bill was not necessary to the extent that the minister has himself required a legislative instrument to deal with something that we think could have been dealt with on a voluntary basis, which would have provided the information that his government wanted and the protection for the industry, which then would have willingly provided the information that would have been required by the government and the panel et cetera to make a rational and informed decision.
              </p>
              <p>
               In some respects the government has almost, in a timing sense, fallen on its own sword. I do not want, as I say, to delay the process, but we do oppose government amendment (4). We do not think it goes far enough. We do not think it deals effectively with the effective use application sanction for misuse of information as our amendment (9) does.

                It would be helpful if both the minister and the opposition member could explain the differences between and the reasons for these amendments. I ask this because we have only received them both this morning and have not had the time to work through them adequately. And it is the normal practice in this place, as I understand it, for there to be arguments put for amendments as they are being tabled. I have no idea whether the opposition’s amendment is superior to the government’s, so it would be helpful if the government sold its amendment somewhat.

                 I appreciate the point you are making. The reason for speed at the moment is that, as they have the numbers, the opposition intend to put in some amendments that the government does not agree with. This will require the bill to go over to the other place and then be bounced back. If we do not complete that either now or, at the latest, tomorrow—tomorrow morning will be a difficult time since, as you would know, often there is no government business in the morning—the actual bill will not pass. If this bill does not pass it will seriously jeopardise the capacity for the tender to take place. We do not sit again until quite late in June, and that will seriously derail the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I apologise for the brevity of the discussion here, but we believe our amendments adequately cover the issues that were raised by the Senate committee. We have a genuine disagreement with the opposition about it, but we believe we have crafted amendments which genuinely are strong enough to deal with the issues raised in the Senate committee. Unfortunately, as I said, time is precious. To facilitate the tender process, we need to get this bill through to the other place so that it can then come back for further debate. I am not sure if that truly solves your problem—I suspect it may not—but we are hampered by the timetabling at the moment.

                  I am not entirely sure why I am speaking to the government’s amendment! But from any reasonable reading of the two amendments, clearly the opposition’s amendment in relation to this matter strengthens the integrity of everything that underpins this bill. We have gone further than the government because we did not think the government were providing the appropriate level of protection for voluntary information. If you read our amendment you will see that it strengthens that. And we are a bit surprised that the government have not taken the opportunity to support this amendment which, in a perverse way, will lead to a far greater inflow of the information that they, the expert panel and others require to make a decision. Indeed, if you do not strengthen this particular aspect of it, there is a very real risk that the information will not be provided in a timely sense, or without some considerable stick, because of the concerns of the carriers—now described as ‘eligible carriers’. That is the reason why we believe our amendment strengthens this bill and will speed the process up. We think the government’s amendment, perversely, will actually hinder the process.

                   The opposition amendments are opposed because they are technically flawed; they are unnecessary because they are already covered by a number of government amendments, as I have already said; and they do not actually appear to guarantee provision of sufficient information voluntarily. They actually fall into the trap of some providers. But, then, that is not a surprise.

                    I am a bit surprised that, at this late hour, the minister is making this description of these amendments, because clearly that is not and could not be and will not be the situation. The issue with the government’s amendments from the outset has been that they do not provide the appropriate levels of protection that we believe are fundamental to this bill. Our amendments are well drafted and they achieve what is required.
