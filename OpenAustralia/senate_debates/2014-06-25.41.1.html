             As Senator Fawcett would be aware, the terrorist group ISIL has lately taken over several cities in north-western Iraq as well as some of the border crossings between Iraqi and Syria. ISIL is a listed terrorist organisation in Australia under the Commonwealth criminal code. Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies are working closely with international partners to combat the threat posed by ISIL and other terrorist groups operating in Iraq, Syria and the region.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any Australians found to be members of terrorist organisations or to have been involved in terrorist activities overseas will be arrested, detained and prosecuted in accordance with Australian law. I can tell Senator Fawcett that we estimate that up to 150 Australians are believed to be involved in the conflict in Syria and now in Iraq. They expose themselves to punishment of up to 25 years imprisonment. And those penalties apply as well to persons who affiliate themselves with or provide support to those foreign fighters.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government has also cancelled the passports of individuals who are assessed to pose a threat to our national security. The government will continue to use that tool to detour individuals from travelling overseas to engage in violent conflicts. The government will also shortly be bringing forward additional legislative measures.

               Yes, I can indeed. The government has decided to give effect to important recommendations of the report of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
                Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
               </a>
               in its inquiry into potential reforms to Australia's national security legislation. I might remind honourable senators that the recommendations of that report, which was the work of the last parliament, had bipartisan support. In particular, I will be introducing legislation in the next sitting fortnight to give effect to the recommendations in chapter 4 of that report. They are the recommendations which deal with the powers of Australia's national security agencies. That legislation has been developed in recent weeks and, as I say, I will be introducing it in the next sitting fortnight.

                  Old Parliament House

                 . I told the imams that the Australian government is taking strong action to protect Australia's national security and that part of that approach involves partnership with them to ensure that their communities remain committed and resilient and safe. The imams are committed to working in partnership with the government to raise awareness of these issues, to provide alternative pathways to individuals who might otherwise be minded to take action in response to the conflict and to raise awareness of the dangers of participating—
