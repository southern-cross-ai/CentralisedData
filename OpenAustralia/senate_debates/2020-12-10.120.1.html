          That was a good response, though. My question is for the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, Senator Ruston. Minister, could you please outline how the Liberals and Nationals in government are supporting our agricultural sector through the recent natural disasters: bushfire, drought and now COVID and the COVID recession?

           I thank Senator Davey for her question and also her longstanding interest in all things agricultural. The Australian agricultural industry has a proud history of overcoming adversity. If you want to look at strength in the face of adversity, you don't have to look much further than the subject of Senator

           's book which was launched today, 'Black Jack' McEwen. Like previous conservative governments, the Morrison government will continue to back our agricultural sector. We'll back them through droughts, we'll back them through floods, we'll back them through bushfires, and this year we have backed them through the coronavirus pandemic. By committing to them drought support—$10 billion—

                 As I was saying, conservative governments over the years have had a very proud relationship with our agricultural sector, and this government is no exception. We will stand side by side with our farming sector through tough times to make sure that we continue to roll out programs that will support the huge contribution that the Australian agricultural sector makes to our economy. As an example, through the coronavirus pandemic, the government announced a $328 million Busting Congestion for Agricultural Exporters package to grow our food and fibre exports. From day one of the pandemic, the government recognised the pivotal role that agriculture would play and particularly the pivotal role that agriculture will play in the economic recovery. We've made sure not just that we look after the agricultural sector itself but that our supply chains remain open and safe, making sure that our access to the rest of the world remains in place by, for instance, addressing the airfreight shortages and the disrupted supply chains overseas through the International Freight Assistance Mechanism put in place by Senator Birmingham. We stand side by side with our farmers.

                    Once again, thank you, Senator Davey, for the opportunity to say what a great industry Australian agriculture is and to acknowledge the fact that, despite the headwinds that this industry has been experiencing over recent times, it remains an industry with a great ability to thrive under adversity. In fact, on Monday, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences revised its outlook for agricultural output in 2021. The gross value of agricultural production is forecast to rise by seven per cent to $65 billion this year. Given we've had droughts, fires and the coronavirus pandemic, this is an outstanding result, and it is an absolute testament to the resilience of our Australian agricultural sector. This government, the Morrison government, will stand side by side with our farmers to make sure we work with them to achieve $100 billion worth of agriculture.

                       As we all know, and there will be no argument from anybody in this place, Australia produces the best food and fibre in the world, and that's why our food and fibre commands the premium prices that it does. It's not only clean and green; it's sustainably grown, and it's produced ethically. This festive season, I'd urge everybody in this place and everybody watching—because I'm sure the whole of Australia's watching question time today—to buy local. If you can, have a look and make sure that that little green and gold icon that says
