        Recommendation 1

         Ministerial Council
        </a>
        , seek the support of state and territory primary industries ministers to harmonise national standards for all domestic meat slaughtering and processing establishments. The committee further recommends that, regardless of the model adopted, the harmonised national standard must include maintenance of dentition as the standard for classifying an animal as lamb and must require that 100 per cent of animals classified as lamb are mouthed at slaughter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, through the forum of the Primary Industries Ministerial Council, consider the costs and benefits of applying the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         West Australian
        </a>
        standard as the model for national harmonisation including examination of compliance and enforcement issues.

       <p class="italic">
        Response to Recommendations 1 and 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed in part.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports harmonisation of national standards where possible including for all domestic meat slaughtering and processing establishments; provided these standards are voluntary and at the initiative of industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not agree that a national standard requires 100 per cent mouthing of animals classified as lamb at slaughter as this may prove onerous on some jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the release of the Senate Standing Committee for Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport’s interim report of its Inquiry into Meat Marketing, the Hon. Tony Burke MP, former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry included the issue of meat marketing on the agenda of the November 2008 Primary Industries Ministerial Council (the council) meeting.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The council established a working group which examined whether models used for all red meat, not just sheep meat, may be suitable for national adoption. One of the models considered was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        standard, which requires 100 per cent mouthing of animals at slaughter. The examination of models was undertaken in the context of considering the costs and benefits of adopting each model including compliance and enforcement issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The working group provided a report to the council at its November 2009 meeting. In its report the working group found:

        consider, when available, the findings of the Sheepmeat Council of Australia and the Australian Meat Industry Council's review of Lamb Brand Control and Verification. The committee recommends that, where appropriate and feasible, the relevant Commonwealth agencies assist the sheepmeat industry to implement recommendations arising from the review.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response to Recommendation 3

        The Australian Government’s position is that any decision about the national adoption of the AUS-MEAT system in domestic processing establishments (which are overseen by the states and territories) should be by consensus through the Primary Industries Ministerial Council process, or by the initiation of industry.

        Regulations under the New South Wales legislation came into effect in August 2010 with a moratorium on enforcement to February 2011. The regulations require retailers to label according to the Domestic Retail Beef Register created by AUS-MEAT. If a retail term contained in the register outside of the basic category of ‘beef’ is used then the label must also contain an age-based descriptor.

However, the industry remains concerned about the potential for unfavourable labelling requirements to be introduced in the future given legislation is now in place that enables the prescription of a labelling scheme. The working group also noted that other states and territories do not intend to introduce similar legislation in their jurisdictions.

        Australian Government Response

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has considered the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee report. The government's response to the recommendations is as follows.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senate Select Committee report Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends an audit be undertaken to establish the extent of foreign ownership of commercial agricultural and pastoral land, and ownership of water, in Australia, with particular emphasis on ownership by sovereign and part sovereign-owned companies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government agrees to this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Foreign investment is important to the Australian economy and to support economic growth and creation of jobs for Australians. Investment in agriculture, whether from foreign or domestic investors, helps to stimulate jobs on farms, and supports services such as harvesting, transport, and processing. These jobs have flow on effects for regional towns and communities through local purchases of inputs, machinery, and the general necessities of life. Moreover, new investment can help Australian agriculture to be more efficient, competitive and profitable in world markets, providing increased opportunities in global markets and access to new technologies and practices.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The available evidence is limited but suggests the current level of foreign ownership of Australian agricultural land and water resources is very low. For example, a survey of commercial broadacre and dairy farms, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) in 2007-08, indicates that an overwhelming majority (99 per cent) of these farms are family operated. Of the remaining 1 per cent, it is estimated that only around 0.1 per cent are foreign owned. Broadacre and dairy farms account for around 70 per cent of Australian farm businesses. Further, investment in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector is a small part of overall foreign investment in Australia, ranging between 0.06 per cent and 1.53 per cent of approved proposals, by value, made through the Foreign Investment Review Board in the last ten years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the Australian Government recognises there are concerns about the sale of rural land and agricultural businesses to foreign investors. These concerns are compounded by the limited data available on foreign ownership. The government is addressing these concerns by taking action to strengthen the transparency of foreign ownership of rural land and agricultural food production. The Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Bill Shorten MP, has asked the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">

       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC) report to the Senate on the current level of agricultural research in OECD countries as a percentage of GDP and the trend for investment over the last ten years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not agree to this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As there is an existing body of work in this area, the Australian Government does not consider it necessary for RIRDC to commission a specific study on this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over recent years there have been many studies by ABARES and other researchers that have assessed expenditure on agricultural research and development over the long term. These studies have analysed the relationship between productivity growth in the agriculture sector and the drivers of that growth, including levels of investment in research and development. Agricultural research and development investment is an ongoing area of interest to the Australian Government and ABARES will continue to examine the relationship between productivity growth and research and development investment in Australian and other developed countries and disseminate results as appropriate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Much of the literature agrees that there are significant lags between research and development investments and the realisation of productivity benefits, often occurring over decades, highlighting the importance of taking a long term perspective to research and development funding. Analyses of investment in research and development are generally undertaken over multi-decadal time frames in order to identify investment trends and their impact on productivity growth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A number of international studies cite reduced investment in agricultural research and development as an important element contributing to the slow-down in agricultural productivity growth in recent years. Public sector investment in agricultural research and development in developed countries grew by an average of 1.89 per cent per year during the 1980s. However, this growth slowed to 0.38 per cent per year through the 1990's and has continued at around the same rate through the last decade (Pardey, 2009).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These studies also use research intensity to compare the levels of agricultural research and development in different countries. Research intensity measures investment in agricultural research and development as a percentage of agricultural
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_Domestic_Product" rel="nofollow">
         Gross Domestic Product
        </a>
        (GDP), or the economic size of the agricultural sector, and provides a better basis for comparing relative levels of investment in agricultural research and development than when compared to national GDP.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Pardey (2009) estimates that although public research intensity grew during the 1980's from 1.62 per cent to 2.33 per cent in 1991, it has remained static since (2.36 per cent in 2000). Public research intensity in developing countries has also remained relatively constant over the past 30 years, albeit at a much lower percentage than developed countries—around 0.5 per cent in 2000.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In regard to Australia, studies (e.g. Mullen 2010 and Sheng et al 2010) indicate that public research intensity grew strongly from the early 1950s through to the late 1970s, peaking at between 4 and 5 per cent of agricultural GDP between 1978 and 1986. More recently, public research intensity in Australia has declined to around 3 per cent of agricultural GDP.

        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 10 September 2009, the Senate referred a matter concerning the state of Hearing Health in Australia to the Community Affairs References Committee (the Committee). The Committee sought submissions and undertook extensive national hearings with stakeholders to examine the following issues:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)   the extent, causes and costs of hearing impairment in Australia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)   the implications of hearing impairment for individuals and the community;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c)   the adequacy of access to hearing services, including assessment and support services, and hearing technologies;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d)   the adequacy of current hearing health and research programs, including education and awareness programs; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e)   specific issues affecting Indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over 180 submissions were received by the Committee and published on its website from a wide range of stakeholders. The Committee tabled its report, Hear Us: Inquiry into Hearing Health in Australia, in Parliament on 13 May 2010 making 34 recommendations.The Australian Government welcomes the Committee’s report and thanks the Committee for its considered approach to the recommendations made in the report.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        recognises that currently the prevalence of hearing loss in Australia is estimated to be one in six, rising to one in four by 2050, making hearing health a significant issue for many individuals and also the wider Australian community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hearing impairment affects individuals across their life course, requiring a range of service responses from early childhood to late adulthood, across disability, health, communication and other areas. These services assist hearing impaired people to engage socially and economically in the community and fulfil their life goals, are supported by professional bodies and a number of government agencies at both the Commonwealth and state/territory levels, and are delivered by providers in both the public and private sectors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government currently provides funding for a wide range of services and programs for people with hearing impairment. These include: the Hearing Services Program (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSP" rel="nofollow">
         HSP
        </a>
