         , made an announcement in relation to further refinements in relation to the income compliance program. Those measures were designed to strengthen and improve the program that was introduced by the Labor Party in 2011. The program changes are designed to make it more robust by requiring more information to be provided in relation to people when we are seeking to determine whether a debt has actually been incurred. As you'd be aware from announcements last year, the government is no longer using income averaging solely as a reason for raising a debt. However, as you would also be aware, this matter is before the courts, so any further comment in relation to thisâ€”

            You've reminded the minister of your question. There was an assertion in the question about the legality of it, so the minister is in order and being directly relevant in addressing that. I think there was the word 'illegal'. The minister can be in order in addressing that as well. I have allowed you to remind the minister of the question. I call the minister to continue.
