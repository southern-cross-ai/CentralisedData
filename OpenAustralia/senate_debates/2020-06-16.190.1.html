        I want to pay tribute to Chai Silvery. On Tuesday, 19 May, I was informed that my office manager, Chai Silvery, had tragically passed away. She had only just given birth to her first child. She was a loved member of my team, fiercely protective of us all and someone who always sought to bring people together. Though not from political circles, she was a person of conviction. She believed in social justice, despised discrimination and treated people respectfully, regardless of rank or privilege. But, like many, she would not have used those words to describe her values.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was unfailingly caring. She always asked about our families, often bringing us delicious Indian food for the office, organising staff lunches before we all flew off to Canberra, and making sure we were rested and healthy when times were very busy. In the early stages of this pandemic, well before restrictions had commenced, Chai went to great lengths to protect me and my staff from harm. She never took no for an answer, even when we protested. She was definitely the boss of the office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born and raised in India, Chai and her husband moved to Broome and became an integral part of that place. She represented the best of the rich multicultural traditions of Broome. She loved Broome and contributed to her community. She was proud of her rich cultural heritage, her language, her movies and her food. And she supported fellow new arrivals to Broome, assisting them to navigate the many barriers in front of them as they called a new place home. Many observing the work of this parliament understandably do not see the hard work our staff undertake, and Chai was an integral member of my team, ensuring that things were organised behind the scenes. My office is a small team, and most of us are based in Broome, far away from Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chai's passing is a huge loss not only for my team but for the Broome community as well. She left her mark in a small town, far away from the place of her birth. Chai is survived by her husband, Nembi, and their newborn daughter, Krishna. I'm personally grateful for her support and, on behalf of my team, I pass on my condolences to her family and recognise her great contribution to this place and to our lives. I wish to also thank and express our gratitude to all the Labor colleagues who have expressed their support and concern for us and for her family as well.
