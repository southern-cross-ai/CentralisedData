        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. Can the minister inform the Senate of how many jobs have been created since the government came to office?

         I thank Senator Johnston for his question. Yes, I can. Under this government, more Australians are in work than ever before. I can advise the Senate that, since this government came to office in September 2013, the level of employment has risen by 366,400, or 3.2 per cent, to a record high of 11,838,200 in October 2015. Under this government, employment has been growing strongly and has risen by 2.7 per cent compared to the decade average rate of 1.8 per cent. In terms of employment growth, over the last year it has been higher—

           than that of every G7 nation, and—
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Lines" rel="nofollow">
            Senator Lines
           </a>
           might like this fact—employment growth under this government is more than three times the rate of the last year that Labor was in government. It is more than three times the rate. It is also worth noting—and again Senator Lines may enjoy this fact—that since July 2014, when the Senate changed, the level of employment has increased by 292,100.

           , you may ask: what does that mean? In plain English, it means that, when you get those on the other side out of the way—which is what we did in July 2014—and this government is able to get on with implementing its economic agenda, what you see is that the rate of jobs growth in Australia increases materially. I can also advise the Senate that the Department of Employment's Vacancy Report shows that job advertisements are up by 2.9 per cent over the year to October 2015. Everything we do on this side is all about jobs growth and creation.

             Quite simply, this is a government that has a plan to create economic growth. That is evidenced by our signing of three free trade agreements, with Japan, Korea—and who can forget the China free trade agreement, which those on the other side rallied against for so long?

            <p>
             It is also why we have set up the $5.5 billion Jobs and

              Small Business
             </a>
             package. Why? It is because we know that we need to help employers to hire unemployed job seekers. It is also why we have set up our new employment services system, jobactive. This new services system focuses on sustainable outcomes, getting people into employment and ensuring that they stay there.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is also why, as a government, we remain committed to the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Why? It is because we understand the value of the construction industry to the Australian economy, and we know it should not be held to ransom by militant unions.

               Let us do a quick compare and contrast. This government, unlike those on the other side, removed unnecessary taxation burdens which were a handbrake on growth and the Australian economy. What did those on the other side do when they were in office? They imposed the carbon tax on the Australian economy. They imposed the mining tax on the Australian economy. And what we also know is this. If they are ever re-elected, if the Australian people thought the carbon tax was bad last time, wait till you see the size of the next carbon tax that those on the other side have—the carbon supertax.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have also set ourselves a target of red-tape reduction of $1 billion a year, and we are exceeding that target. We are also working with employers to get people into sustainable employment. We are focused on outcomes. This is a government that has a plan to grow the economy and grow jobs. Those on the other side just want to stifle it.
