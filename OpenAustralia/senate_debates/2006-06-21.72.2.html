        I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement" rel="nofollow">
         Law Enforcement
        </a>
        Integrity Commissioner Bill 2006Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006Law Enforcement (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        Professional Standards and Related Measures) Bill 2006
       </p>
       <p>
        I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The statement read as followsâ€”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important that the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Bill 2006, the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 and the Law Enforcement (AFP Professional Standards and Related Measures) Bill 2006 (the bills) are passed through the Senate prior to 1 July 2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bills will enhance the integrity of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies by creating a framework for investigating and dealing with allegations of corruption.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important that the bills be passed as quickly as possible in order to minimise any period of uncertainty about the new anti-corruption regime.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is concerned that any delay in the establishment of ACLEI could give rise to a loss of public confidence or of confidence among
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        law enforcement personnel. The bills are also of interest to potential State and Territory secondees and their home agencies. Public confidence in law enforcement agencies and the confidence of the staff of those agencies are important contributors to their effective performance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the Government is concerned that any delay in the passage of these Bills will result in resources committed to both ACLEI and the new AFP professional standards regime remaining idle until the legislation commences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The legislation cannot come into effect until the first Integrity Commissioner is appointed. It will not be practicable to make a final selection for the Integrity Commissioner position until the legislation has been enacted and there is likely to be some further delay before the person selected is available to take up duty. If these bills are not passed before the end of these Sittings, these factors could significantly delay the commencement of this important legislation.
