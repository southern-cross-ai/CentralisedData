         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau" rel="nofollow">
          The Bureau
         </a>
         informed Eucla community leaders of the changes during September-October 2012. The service announcement formally advising of the changes was placed on the Bureau's website in early October 2012.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (http://www.bom.gov.au/weather-services/announcements/radar/eucla_tennant_creek_dec2012.shtml )
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The Bureau of Meteorology's weather forecasts and warnings for all regions, including Eucla, are based on a combination of various observing systems, including satellite, radar, lightning, upper air and surface observations together with predictions from advanced computer-based models. The Bureau is continuously reviewing its observations networks to ensure that these services are delivered in the most efficient and effective way possible.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         At Eucla, the radar, primarily installed to track weather balloons, is no longer required as satellites and other observation sources provides the Bureau with information to support the Bureau's forecast, climate and warning services. Streamlining and automation of other equipment at the meteorological office has also reduced the requirement to retain staff on the station. The full time observer based at Eucla has been relocated to another site.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In close conjunction with implementing these changes, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         Regional Forecast Centre switched to the Next Generation Forecast and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_System" rel="nofollow">
          Warning System
         </a>
         (NexGenFWS) on 31 October this year, providing seven-day forecasts for Eucla and extended district and coastal waters forecasts.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The weather and warning service for Eucla was expanded to include 7 day forecasts for Eucla and District from 31 October 2012.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Coastal Waters forecasts for the adjacent Eucla coast have also been extended to 4 days and with the introduction of the Bureau's new information portal "MetEye" in 2013, coastal wind and weather information will be available out to 7 days.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Bureau will continue to issue Severe Thunderstorm Warnings and Severe Weather Warnings for the Eucla District.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Members of the community can continue to obtain current weather, forecast and warning information from the Bureau's website, radio and television, as well as by phoning the Bureau's Telephone Weather Service on 1900 926 113.
