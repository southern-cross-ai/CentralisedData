        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. I refer to the minister’s media release of 23 October 2009, in which he stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the vast majority of claims are being dealt with in about 100 days.
       </p>
       <p>
        Less than a month later, the government offered those aboard the

          Oceanic Viking
         </a>
        </i>
        a special deal of resettlement within 28 to 42 days. How does the Rudd government expect those who are in immigration detention or the Australian public to have any confidence in our immigration system when it appears that the government is making policy on the run, with special deals and fast-tracked processing?

         I thank Senator Back for the question. It is, of course, similar to questions I received all last week and this week, which are based on an assertion that there is a special deal in relation to those who disembarked the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_Viking" rel="nofollow">

         . As I have been at pains to report to the Senate the disembarkation of the
         <i>
          Oceanic Viking
         </i>
         passengers in Indonesia was agreed between the Australian and Indonesian governments as a way of dealing with those persons who were rescued at sea in the Indonesian search and rescue zone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under those arrangements, we agreed with the Indonesians as to what would happen when those people disembarked. We did not suggest they be processed on the ship, as suggested by Dr Stone, the opposition spokesperson. We did not agree to bring them directly to Australia, as suggested by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Barnett" rel="nofollow">
          Colin Barnett

         , the

        </p>
        <p>
         They will be processed in accordance with the agreements between the two governments. Those processes have commenced;

          UNHCR

         is conducting those processes in the normal way, and those processes will find that those who are found to be refugees will be resettled in accordance with UNHCR processes. Those who are found not to be refugees will be returned by the Indonesian government to their country of origin. That is what they have stated publicly and that is the position that the Australian government adopts as well, and I expect that to occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         All those processes are normal processes that are applied in Indonesia, and the treatment of those off the
         <i>

         is part of the arrangements made with the Indonesian government. The processes for those currently found not to be refugees are not dissimilar to those standard ones.

                . I remind the Senator that to develop policy or come to conclusions purely based on what a couple of journalists have written or said is not a very sound approach, because as I understand it, Mr President, all those journalists are agreed on one other matter—that is, that the Liberal opposition are a complete rabble, that they are divided, that they are undermining their leader, that Senator Minchin is in open revolt in defiance of his leader and that they are a standing joke in Australian politics. If Senator Back wants to rely on the combined opinions of certain journalists, I refer him to their views on his and his colleagues’ performance. Senator, none of this is a replacement for development of sound policy and prosecution of that policy.

                  It is, in fact, not an indication of a special deal as claimed. I will remind Senator Back of when these mobile teams were used previously.

                  . Putting that to one side, this is standard practice that has been used on many occasions.
