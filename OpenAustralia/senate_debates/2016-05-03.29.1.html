        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to the report by Cadence Economics, released by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Universities Australia
        </a>
        yesterday, which found that the ability of our nation to expand the knowledge and skills of our workforce to drive productivity growth is vital if Australia is to raise living standards. Minister, why is it the Turnbull government's policy to cut university funding and impose $100,000 degrees on students and their families?

         Senator Dodson, can I take this opportunity to welcome you to the Senate and congratulate you on your maiden question. I feel sure we all expect that you will make a distinguished and important contribution to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Senate
         </a>
         . However, on this occasion might I give you a tip. Do not read out questions that are handed to you by Senator Stephen Conroy, Senator Penny Wong or any of those geniuses who sit on the Labor Party question time tactics committee—because I am afraid that your colleagues have set you up. Far from the cuts of which you speak in the question that you were given, the Australian government in fact continues to be the majority funder of universities in Australia. In 2014, over $15 billion was spent by the Australian government on higher education supporting teaching and research. This is up from $12 billion in 2009 when the demand driven funding system was introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Dodson, I can assure you—and we will hear more of this in the budget tonight I am sure—that the government will continue to make significant investments to strengthen Australia's higher education and research sectors and improve Australia's position as a knowledge based nation. The government's support is important as universities make a fundamental contribution to the future of Australia and our intellectual, economic, cultural and social development. This government is absolutely committed to funding universities so that they can continue to do so. You will also be pleased to know that we are absolutely committed to the principle of equity of access so that the economic circumstances of a student should not stand in the way of their education.

           Universities Australia
          </a>

            Universities Australia
           </a>
           , I completely agree with it. I completely agree with the proposition that a better educated nation, a nation with a thriving and flourishing university sector in both teaching and research is overwhelmingly beneficial, and that is why this government is committed to supporting the university sector. That is why we want to encourage more young Australians into universities. That is why we want to improve the research capacity of Australian universities. That is why, as I said to you in answer to your primary question, we have increased spending from $12 billion in 2009 to over $15 billion in 2014 on the Australian government's contribution to university education. We on our side of the chamber are very proud of Australia's universities and we continue to support them.
