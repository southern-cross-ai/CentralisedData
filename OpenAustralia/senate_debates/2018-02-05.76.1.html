        My question is to Senator Birmingham, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Energy. I congratulate him on his promotion. It's good to finally see a

        On 16 March last year, Minister Frydenberg announced: 'Australia's first virtual power plant goes live in South Australia.' The minister said that the $20 million project, combining solar panels and batteries in 1,000 residential and business premises to build a five-megawatt power station, would 'lower power bills, reduce emissions and provide stability'. How many megawatts of electricity has the project delivered?

         I thank Senator Farrell for his question and his kind words, although Senator Farrell seems to have forgotten that it's not that long since Senator Nick Minchin sat in the chair that Senator Cormann occupies, and that before him Senator Robert Hill sat in the chair that Senator Cormann now occupies. So there is a long history, indeed, of

         However, I'm very happy in the seat where I now am, Senator Wong, to ensure that you don't start any conspiracy theories. In relation to the precise detail that Senator Farrell has asked for, I'll have to take that on notice and seek some information for Senator Farrell to get that precise detail. As Senator Farrell is well aware, the Turnbull government continues to work across a range of levels to make sure that energy is more reliable and more affordable, and, indeed, that we meet our international obligations in relation to energy generation. That's evident through our work in relation to the development of the National Energy Guarantee. We are pleased to see progress and support from a number of state governments, including Labor state governments, but, unfortunately, not from the

               We all look forward to seeing details of Mr Weatherill's announcement and to see what it may or may not do. But I do have some doubts about whether or not Mr Weatherill will be able to achieve all of the things that Senator Farrell has asked about. It was only four years ago, in the last
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                South Australia
               </a>
               n election, that Mr Weatherill was making a promise suggesting that they would provide solar panels for some 5,000 low-income families. Four years later, do you know what's happened in relation to Mr Weatherill's last promise on this matter? Only 400 of the 5,000 have been delivered.
              </p>
              <p>
               What we saw yesterday was Mr Weatherill engage in another stunt with
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" rel="nofollow">
                Elon Musk
               </a>
               to try to get a bit of extra attention and media publicity. But we know that when it comes to these promises they don't deliver at the state level. They didn't deliver on their promises at the last election, they no doubt won't deliver this time, and it is a case of playing catch-up—catch-up with Mr Marshall, who had already announced support for battery—

It is a commitment that we have been working to see implemented ever since, and we are determined not only to see that project go ahead but to see an overall fix across the board in terms of the failings in the energy market, which have been contributed to by the poor policy positions of the
