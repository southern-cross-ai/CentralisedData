        I rise today to commend the work of the Albanese government in the realm of foreign affairs and trade. Many Australians all over the country have seen the images of the Prime Minister meeting with his Chinese counterpart and working to build a more reliable and productive relationship with one of our biggest trading partners. This is most welcome, because we are a trading nation. We are a strong and robust democracy. This is in stark contrast to how the previous Morrison government managed Australia's international affairs. The Albanese government has turned this nation from a pariah on the international stage to a trustworthy member of the international community. While the Albanese government will increase dialogue, it's important also to reiterate that our relationship with China is founded on principles of cooperation where possible and disagreement where that is also necessary. It's a sophisticated, nuanced and important relationship, and we must attend to it with care, in the interest of our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the establishment of this robust trading relationship come new opportunities for Australian exports such as timber, wine, barley and tourism. The whole of Australia has hugely benefited from past tourism from Chinese citizens and tour groups, and, while we're very aware of the beauty that our nation can share with the world, it's very important that we attend to the actual, practical reality of having a robust tourism sector. The flow-on effects for regional Australia, businesses and jobs cannot be shoved into a corner in the darkness. We must remind ourselves of how important this is.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the recent announcements from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang, they welcomed the contribution of people-to-people exchanges in the bilateral relationship, including increases in the exchange of students, tourists and businesspeople following the lifting of border measures. This includes the introduction of three-to-five year multi-entry visas for visitors and businesspeople to create more long-lasting opportunities and connections for trade. Of course, these need to be scrutinised in ways that enhance our own national security at the same time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Within my own duty electorates, there are many opportunities for local businesses who benefit from the hard work of their government, the Albanese Labor government. The Bush Bus and Blueline will, hopefully, have buses of international students coming nonstop, while timber mills such as Newells Creek Sawmilling has a great opportunity for trade. The lush and historic Riverina should see more businesses coming to take advantage of good-quality Australian timber produced at Natural Edge Milling while they bask in the majesty of Kengal Aboriginal Place. Parks and the beautiful rural and agrarian land can see the benefits to users of its primary industry, like Narrabri Farm Centre, and have increased interest while international visitors enjoy the stargazer's dream that is

        continuing to succeed. Visitors to Calare, domestic and international, should look forward to watching the Bathurst race while enjoying a sip of the booming wine business at the base of Mount Panorama Wines. Within the beautiful electorate of Hume, I hope to see wineries such as the Greenwich Park Winery enjoy an uptick in demand for a solid Australian product. This combines with the picturesque vineyards that scatter the region, which would most definitely welcome an increase in holidaymakers.
       </p>
       <p>
        A further aspect of the joint outcome statement was an agreement to practical steps to advance dialogue in areas of common interests, including climate change, trade and people-to-people links. While there are many and important differences to note between Australia and China, the differences should not be the only things that define our relationships. Dialogue is key for all different types of relationships, and Australia's relationship with China is one of the most important to the nation in terms of trade. This is vital for regional stability and security. It's to our shared mutual advantage to have an Asia-Pacific that is peaceful, stable and prosperous, particularly in a time of global headwinds. It strengthens the economy, it supports jobs, it safeguards business, and it helps set Australia up for a safe and prosperous future.
