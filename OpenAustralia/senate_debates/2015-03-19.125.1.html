        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Senator Cash. Given the $3 billion of federal contribution currently committed to the East West Link project, a massive, polluting road which Victorians rejected, my question is: regarding the evidence we now have that the contracted consortium wrote their own side letter ensuring exorbitant compensation if the new government sensibly did not build it, was the government aware that the secret side letter had been drafted by the consortium and signed off by the then Victorian government? Was it perhaps mentioned at a meeting of the steering committee for East West Link that the federal government was represented on? If so, did the federal government approve?

            Apart from the 6,000 jobs that clearly those opposite, including Senator Rice, do not want to create, this takes incompetence by Labor state governments to a whole new level. It is the only government in Australia that actually wants to pay in excess of $1 billion not to build a road.

                    As I said, in relation to this project, this is a government that leaves in building jobs, creating jobs for Australia, and building the infrastructure of tomorrow. It is just a little bit of a shame that the

                     , I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister was not willing to answer the question, in more general terms does the minister believe that it is good practice to booby trap major infrastructure projects for incoming governments by making deals like this with big business?

                      Let me tell you what I do believe. I believe it is good practice to deliver projects that are going to create 6,000 jobs for Victorians, and I do not consider it good practice for a government to pay in excess of $1 billion of taxpayers' money not to build a road. This government has a very, very clear message for the Victorian Labor government, and it is a very simple one: build the road.

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. WestConnex is another massive, polluting tollway that residents do not want, with many of the hallmarks of the east-west tollroad. Residents do not want it and it will not fix congestion. Given the lessons learnt in Victoria, why is the government continuing to commit billions of federal taxpayer dollars? Is this part of what the

                        are going to be, because, again, this is an example of good infrastructure. It is expected to deliver $20 billion worth of economic benefit to the people of New South Wales—$20 billion. It is expected to boost local economies. It is expected to improve travel times. It is expected to create 10,000 jobs. Senator Rice, what are you opposed to—the creation of jobs? Is that what you are opposed to? Are you opposed to better transport? Are you opposed to building the infrastructure that is going to ensure that Australians today and tomorrow are able to travel in an efficient manner?
