        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Today the

         Western Sydney
        </a>
        Aboriginal Medical Service is closing its doors after 28 years of serving the community. I note the financial management challenges this organisation has experienced, but other services have been helped to reorganise, have been partnered with other organisations and have managed to find a way to continue to support the community. Why has the government decided in this instance to essentially push the 11,000 people who were supported by this Aboriginal service into mainstream services?

         say at the outset that the priority is ensuring that we have continuity of services for people who have been using the services provided by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMS" rel="nofollow">
          AMS
         </a>
         . It is very clear that this service has been in some difficulty, and it has been a considerable period of time that that difficulty has been experienced by this service. Of course, the government does not like taking steps such as we have needed to take in this particular instance, but let me be clear that the Western Sydney AMS is in significant debt and has been for some time. In fact, the organisation has been trading insolvent since June 2013.
        </p>

         This government takes the economic responsibility of the organisations that are providing these services very, very seriously. On 5 August the creditors, including the staff, voted in favour of liquidating the organisation. This government has been working very closely with the Ministry of Health in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , with the local health district and with colleagues from both sides of parliament to ensure that there is a way forward that is going to enable the patients who have been using this service to continue accessing these services. We are very cognisant of the fact that retaining the facilities and the building itself will be very important for ensuring that those services are continued. This government takes economic responsibility very seriously, and that extends to services that we fund. That is why the steps have been taken in this case.

          I thank the minister for answering a questionâ€”it does not happen that often in this place! I ask a supplementary question: what has happened to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Health
          </a>
          funding that previously supported these Aboriginal clients? Has this been directed to alternative Aboriginal services, and if not, why not?

           Very shortly we will be announcing some arrangements relating to this particular service. The ongoing funding for the delivery of services will be there. But it is very important to recognise that we have to fund these services in an economically responsible way. With that comes requirements put on these services about how they will operate. That is what we expect, I think that is what the Australian people expect, and I would certainly hope that it is what everybody around this chamber would expect. Rather than trying to drum up some hysteria around this particular issue, it is important that we look at the facts and recognise that the government is taking steps to ensure that we have as seamless a transition as possible. We are very well aware how important the cultural delivery of these health services is and we will be taking steps to maintain that.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I note that if I was trying to drum up hysteria I would not be asking these questions in the manner in which I am asking them. I hear what the minister has just answered, that the minister will be announcing services. I notice that she did not mention whether they will be Aboriginal-delivered services. I am particularly keen to know whether you are working with the community and the services that you have already outlined to develop or support a new Aboriginal medical service or in fact deliver health services from a community perspective?

             Some of that hysteria that I was referring to was not from the senator, if I can clarify that. The community delivery of these services is very important. One of the things that this government is very well aware of is how important local delivery through the Indigenous services is to the people who are accessing services from these Aboriginal medical services themselves. I think that is really important. Certainly that is the intent. We were left in a situation where there was no choice but for the steps to be taken that have been taken by the government. But nobody should be in any doubt as to how much focus and priority the government is putting on making as seamless a transition as we possibly can to ensure that those people in

             have access to culturally appropriate medical services.
