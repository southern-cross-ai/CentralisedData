         Thank you, Senator Green, who, like so many people on this side of the chamber, spent much of her working life before coming here working for the interests of working people—something that I know is a foreign concept for those opposite. As we know, a key component in addressing the real cost-of-living pressure that many Australians are facing is increasing wages, and, finally, we are moving on from a decade of a government that deliberately held down wages.

             the most for any new government on record. After a decade of low wages being a deliberate design feature from people like Senator Cash, the Albanese government is ensuring that every single one of those workers is being paid accordingly. Thanks to long-overdue reforms, wages are finally moving again under the Albanese government. Employers are back at the bargaining table, thanks to last year's secure jobs, better pay reforms. However, loopholes still remain within the Fair Work Act that undermine worker pay and conditions—again, loopholes that existed under legislation we inherited from Senator Cash and the opposition.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first loophole is that, if a worker steals from an employer, it is a crime, as it should be; however, if an employer quite deliberately steals from their worker, in most places in Australia it is not a crime. The Albanese government is closing this loophole by criminalising wage theft. The second loophole was the idea of the forced permanent casual worker. We're standing up for casual workers by giving those who are working like they are permanent a chance to convert to permanent employment. We'll see how much the opposition cares about workers and cost of living when it comes to a vote.

                Thank you Senator Green. Unfortunately, these loopholes that we have inherited from 10 years of coalition government disproportionately affect vulnerable workers like women, young people and migrants. We need a strong new deterrent to ensure workers get the pay they are entitled to. That's why we're acting on wage theft—something the former coalition government didn't do in the 10 years that they were in office.
               </p>
               <p>
                Some casuals work just like permanent employees, but they don't get any of the benefits of job security under the laws we inherited from the coalition government. Closing this loophole will give more than 850,000 casual workers who are working in an ongoing way the option to request permanency if they want it. No-one will be forced to convert from casual to permanent if they don't want to. Labour hire loopholes undermine the integrity of the enterprise bargaining system. Closing this loophole—something the coalition didn't do in the 10 years they were in office—will affect only a small number of workers. But, for the workers this affects, closing this loophole will be life changing. There will be more that we do because we're serious about getting wages moving again.

                  <p>
                   Thank you, Senator Green. Of course, under the former coalition government, there was always a new excuse for why they couldn't deliver a wage increase for workers—'Just wait for low unemployment; if unemployment comes down then wages will go up.' That's what they said. But, of course, unemployment came down and wages were still held down by the coalition government. Then they moved on—'Just wait for productivity increases,' they said. But, of course, they never came under the former coalition government either.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Leader of the Opposition can stand on shop floors and worksites in outer suburban areas and make all the claims that he wants about being for the battler, but workers know that the Liberals and Nationals are not on their side and never have been on their side. They have only ever been on the side of holding back workers' wages. The coalition said no to Secure Jobs, Better Pay, before they even read the bill. Why did they say no to that? They didn't like the name of the bill, Secure Jobs, Better Pay—'Oh, we better vote no against that straightaway.' But what has occurred since that bill has been passed? Stronger jobs growth and higher wages. We're acting; you're opposing.
