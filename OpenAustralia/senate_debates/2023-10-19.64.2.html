        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. In response to a question from Senator Waters yesterday in relation to the explosion at al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, which has resulted in further tragic loss of innocent lives, you correctly at the time noted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are obviously conflicting reports about what has occurred.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overnight, President Biden has stated that, based on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        information, it appears to be as a result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza. A spokesperson for the

        further clarified:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … our current assessment, based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts, and open source information, is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza …
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, what is Australia's assessment or understanding of responsibility for the tragic explosion at al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza?

         I thank Senator Birmingham for the question, and I start first by again saying that we saw devastating loss of life in the heinous attacks on Israel by Hamas and we have also seen tragic loss of life in the explosion at the hospital in Gaza. There has been, clearly, a devastating loss of civilian life, and I want to reiterate what I said yesterday and what the Prime Minister said: every innocent life matters, whether Israeli or Palestinian. We express that our thoughts are with those killed or injured and their loved ones, that the protection of civilian life must come first and that respect for international humanitarian law is paramount, and we join with others in doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
         My response is to the question about the attack itself. Obviously this is a conflict zone. Assessments are difficult. I think it is probably most appropriate, again, to refer to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         National Security Council's words, which Senator Birmingham referenced. The statement that was made was:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         While we continue to collect information, our current assessment … is that Israel is not responsible for the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I would say, however, is that we recognise the great distress that so many in the Australian community are feeling at this time—from the Jewish community, and also from the Palestinian community and the Muslim community more generally. I think everybody looking at what has occurred, and most particularly or most recently the deaths of civilians at the hospital, would agree this is a tragic set of circumstances.

           Minister, are you aware of any progress towards the release of Israeli hostages that continue to be held by Hamas some 12 days after their brutal and bloody assault on Israel? Further, are you aware of any progress to ensure humanitarian supplies, including food, water and medicines, are made available to innocent citizens, civilians, in Gaza?

            Thank you to Senator Birmingham. In relation to the first question, I have no update to provide to the Senate in relation to the situation regarding hostages. I simply indicate that Australia has privately and publicly called for the release of hostages, and I'm sure we are joined by all in this chamber.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to humanitarian assistance, this has remained challenging, as has the related issue of foreign nationals and civilians being permitted to exit Gaza by the limited number of crossings into the

               The first thing that we all must do—the government is doing, but all of us must do—is to recognise that our words matter. This is a moment where feelings and attitudes in our country are affected obviously by the events we are seeing but also by the words of leaders, by the words of politicians. So the government is working to engage with members of the Jewish community and with members of the Palestinian community and the Muslim community more broadly. I think it was very important. I thank the opposition for their support of a bipartisan motion on this. We may have different political views, but there are times when it is very important that the parties of government speak together, because our multicultural community—our diverse community—which is hurting, really need politicians to be able to speak as one on the key issues that matter, and I thank you for that.

                 I thank Senator Smith for her question. I know so many Australians are deeply concerned over the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We welcome the statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's office following President Biden's request that Israel will not prevent humanitarian assistance entering Gaza from Egypt. We welcome the United States commitment to provide $100 million in humanitarian support, and we understand large-scale international humanitarian aid is on standby at the Rafah border crossing ready for distribution once the border is open. This includes the supplies that our trusted partners, such as
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF" rel="nofollow">
                  UNICEF
                 </a>
                 , have been able to ready thanks to Australia's initial $10 million humanitarian commitment. I would also like to acknowledge the generous contribution from the Minderoo Foundation, pledged by Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who have committed a matching donation of $10 million in humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The government is deeply concerned by violent protests across the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
                  Middle East
                 </a>
                 , including in Lebanon. I want to be very clear that the government has serious concerns for the security situation in Lebanon. To Australians in Lebanon: please, please know that we have today upgraded Australia's travel advice for Lebanon to level 4—Do not travel. This means that, if you are an Australian in Lebanon, you should consider leaving now if it is safe to do so. I repeat: if you are an Australian in Lebanon, you should consider leaving now if it is safe to do so. Commercial departure options remain available, but this may change with little notice during a crisis. Again, I encourage people to monitor the Smartraveller website for the latest advice.

                    Thank you, Senator Smith. Overnight, an Australian government assisted departure flight landed in Sydney with 252 passengers onboard, including 126 Australians. A

                    flight landed in Dubai from

                    </a>
                    , carrying 59 passengers. Subject to security conditions, we are planning an assisted departure flight from Tel Aviv to Dubai today. We strongly encourage Australians who want to leave to consider this flight and do not wait for another option. As I've said in this place this week, we have had a lot of empty seats on flights. This will be our last flight for the foreseeable future. I repeat: today's flight will be our last flight for the foreseeable future.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We continue to assist Australians who wish to leave the occupied Palestinian territories, including working to secure Australians' safe passage out of Gaza. I appreciate this is extremely difficult. We understand how dangerous the situation is, and we are working very hard with partners on this.

                       In the context of the crisis unfolding, obviously one of our key priorities is to work with other countries to prevent this conflict from spilling over. Yesterday I spoke about this. That is also why we are so clear in our call that civilian lives must come first and respect for humanitarian law is paramount. That is why our priority is supporting Australians in Israel, in the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                        West Bank
                       </a>
                       and in Gaza and in securing a humanitarian corridor to Gaza for the safe departure of civilians.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Here at home, our role as a government and, I would say, our role as a Senate is to do all we can to keep our country unified and to make sure our community feels heard, and I ask all senators to be part of that effort. There are times when it is important that we put aside partisan politics and differences of views because there is a greater purpose to what we are doing.
