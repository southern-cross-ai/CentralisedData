        My question is directed to the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. When did the minister first become aware of the need for expansion of the Shoalwater Bay Training Area and Townsville Field Training Area as part of the military training agreement with Singapore? Was it before or after the 2 July election?

         The signing of the memorandum of understanding with Singapore that set out the agreed parameters of the increased training access Australia would offer, on 13 October 2016, represented the formal agreement by both countries to the scale of the increased access Singapore would be offered. Following that signing, it was then possible for Defence to begin the process of obtaining a detailed master plan and getting that process underway, through which the precise requirements could be clarified, and to begin engaging with stakeholders.

                                 Order on both sides! It is a timely point now to remind all senatorsâ€”and there is no innocence at any point in this chamberâ€”that interjections are disorderly. Senator Brandis made a key point: that there are times during question time where robustness is tolerated, but to a minimum. Interjections have become a bit disorderly. Senator Cameron's point was that it is not up to other senators to advise senators how their behaviour should be conducted during question time, or other times for that matter. I would just ask all senators to consider their behaviour in the chamber. As I have mentioned before, we have the public watching us, as we do today, during live coverage of question time. We have people in the gallery, and often we have school groups here. I think our behaviour needs to be reflected upon and I ask all senators to consider that.

                                 I thank senators for their contributions to the points of order. As for the substantive point of order raised by Senator Wong in relation to Senator Payne, Senator Payne, in fairness, was only a quarter of the way into her answer. I remind Senator Payne of the question.
