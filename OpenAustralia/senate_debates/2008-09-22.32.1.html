         In respect of the Forward with Fairness policy implementation plan, the Australian government is committed to—let me be clear about this and the Liberals should understand—maintaining the existing arrangements for the building and construction industry including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
          ABCC
         </a>
         until 31 January 2010. After that date, the ABCC will be replaced by a specialist building and construction division of the inspectorate of Fair Work Australia, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FWA" rel="nofollow">
          FWA
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The government are also committed to consult widely with industry stakeholders on the arrangement and the specialist division will apply. On 22 May 2008 the government announced that they would ask the Hon. Murray Wilcox
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
          QC
         </a>
         to conduct consultations with the industry and report on how best to transition to the specialist division of the FWA inspectorate. The Australian government have asked
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Honour" rel="nofollow">
          His Honour
         </a>
         to report by the end of March 2009. The terms of reference for that were released on 24 July 2008. It is important to understand what the key industry players are doing in the sense that His Honour has engaged in close consultation—

           Mr President
          </a>
          . This was a very specific question. We do not want a tour around the

           ALP
          </a>

           ABCC
          </a>

             His Honour

            is highly respected and that he will bring wisdom and balance to the exercise. In addition, this government has no tolerance for behaviour in the building and construction industry that breaks the law whether it is unlawful industrial action or underpayment of employees.

             I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. Under standing order 196 it is within the province of the President to require somebody speaking in the Senate to be relevant. Clearly, a very specific question has been asked and, with great respect, the appointment of

              On the point of order, I contend that there is no point of order. That is the second time Senator Abetz has tried to take that spurious point of order. Senator Ludwig is answering directly on the subject of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
               ABCC
              </a>
              , its power, its future and Labor government policy relating to it. He is clearly on message on the question as asked. While Senator Abetz may be disappointed that after talking up his promotional prospects all weekend they did not eventuate, I am sorry about that. But Senator Ludwig is particularly on the subject matter of the question asked.

                What we do expect is that all parties maintain respect for the workplace relations laws, including perhaps a commitment from the Liberals that they have now abandoned

                 Work Choices

                and gone on to a new fair industrial relations system, including the

This government’s approach is to consult in its workplace relations reform, which is really in stark contrast to the previous government’s approach. We will continue—

The system ensures, of course, that if there are matters that should be referred for police investigation they will be. And of course it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment about those specific matters, but, in general to the broader question what I can say—

                       On the point of order, clearly those opposite want to disrupt question time today to cover for the poor quality of their questions. There is no relevance whatsoever in standing order 196. What is tediously repetitious today is these spurious points of order. I ask you to dismiss this point of order and see if we can get back to answering some questions in the time available.
