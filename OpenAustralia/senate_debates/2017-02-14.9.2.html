        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Mr Ciobo, who says that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        has demonstrated an approach:
       </p>
       <p>
        … reflective of what it is … to govern Australia in a fiscally responsible way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is it the government's position that One Nation's policy of a flat tax of two per cent on every Australian is fiscally responsible?

         Thank you, Senator Ketter; that is a very good question, as I would expect from a fellow Villanova man. I have not seen Mr Ciobo's remarks, but, because I know you are an honest and trustworthy person, I will take them at face value; I would not do that from everyone on your side, but I will from you, Senator Ketter. I find Mr Ciobo to be a very, very wise person. He is a good friend of mine, and I would not disagree at all with anything Mr Ciobo had to say. I dare say that what Mr Ciobo was referring to was the fact that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         , in this chamber, has consistently, as Senator Sinodinos pointed out earlier in the week, voted for the government's legislation—the government's legislation to try, in particular, to repair the wreckage wrought to the budget by the previous Labor government and the previous Labor finance minister, Senator Penny Wong. That, I dare say, is what Mr Ciobo was referring to. But I would be a bit wary about opening that question up, Senator Ketter, because you probably were not in the chamber yesterday afternoon during taking note of answers when it was revealed by Senator Hanson, quoting from documents, that One Nation had received an approach from the Queensland branch of the Labor Party.

         An opposition senator: That is a lie!
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator, you can bawl that it is a lie, but Senator Anthony Chisholm was in the chamber throughout that debate, and time and time again he was called upon to deny it—he being the state secretary at the relevant time—and he was silent. Not a word did he utter. His silence was his consent to that allegation.

            I agree; I think it was a very foolish policy. I do not know if it is their policy now, but it was a very foolish policy then. I do not know if it is still their policy, but, if it is, it is a very foolish policy. I think you would agree with me about that.

You are perfectly at liberty to disagree with them, as I do on many issues, but, at the same time, you ought to respect the decision of the Australian people.
