        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Cash. Can the minister update the Senate on the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on Australians and their mental health and why it's important to ensure support is available to protect the lives and livelihoods of Australians?

         will be aware that earlier today the minister for health addressed the parliament and gave an update on Australia's response to the COVID-19 situation. As at 6:30 am today, Australia has 6,970 confirmed cases of COVID-19. More than 6,257 of them have fully recovered. Fifteen people are in intensive care and 13 people are on ventilators. Sadly, there has been a total of 98 deaths from the virus. The rate of increase in new cases has gone from 25 to 30 per cent per day, at the peak of growth in cases at the end of March, to less than half a per cent a day now. The rate of increase has been below 0.5 per cent for 23 consecutive days.
        </p>
        <p>
         Globally, more than four million cases have been confirmed, with more than 290,000 deaths. This puts the threat we face in the clearest context. As the minister has stated, we need to be clear: our work is not finished, and the virus is not defeated. There is still a long way to go, and we have a long road to travel to protect our national health.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week we saw a very powerful piece of work from Pat McGorry and Ian Hickie, from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          University of Sydney
         </a>
         , highlighting the extent to which Australians' mental health is at risk in a major economic downturn. We know that supporting Australians to get back to work is critical for their economic security and their aspirations but also to help with their mental health. These factors are intrinsically linked. This is a deeply human reminder of the importance of assisting people to get back to work.

            The government's $74 million mental health support package will make sure that Australians have access to the right services and the right support wherever they are around the country. The expanded telehealth program is playing a critical role in providing mental health care and support during the pandemic. About half of all mental health Medicare subsidised services are currently provided by telehealth as well as a significant proportion of general consultations under the $669 million program.

               The Minister for Health today announced the new position of deputy chief medical officer for mental health. Leading psychiatrist Dr Ruth Vine has been appointed—and we extend our congratulations to her—as a deputy chief medical officer with expertise in mental health.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just as the government is modelling the spread of COVID-19 infection to continue flattening the curve, we are also closely monitoring mental health service usage so that we can respond quickly and thus lessen the mental health impacts of the pandemic and the recovery phase. As a next step, a national mental health pandemic response plan will this week be discussed with states and territories through the national cabinet. The plan has been prepared with the support of the National Mental Health Commission in consultation with states and territories and key stakeholders. Again, the mental health and wellbeing of Australians is a priority.
