         I thank Senator McEwen for her question. The most important thing a government can do is assist industry to give people the security and dignity that comes with a job. This government is about jobs and has a proud track record when it comes to job creation. Nearly 30 million people across the globe lost their jobs as a result of the global financial crisis; however, this government saved thousands of jobs with our timely and effective economic stimulus package. Australia's unemployment rate, which is at 4.9 per cent, remains amongst the lowest in the world, the participation rate remains at a high 65.6 per cent, as at May this year, and 7,800 new jobs were created in the month of May. That was despite the challenges facing some key industries in the Australian economy, particularly as a result of the high value of the Australian dollar. The latest jobs figures are testament to the underlying strength of the Australian economy. This is at a time when the United States is recording an unemployment rate of around nine per cent and countries in Europe are recording unemployment rates close to 10 per cent. That means that one in 10 Europeans who want to work cannot find a job—a very sobering reality. Labor is the party of work, jobs and opportunity. Since coming to government we have created 258,000 more jobs than were created by the Howard government over the same period. Labor believes those who can work should work and those who want to work should have the opportunity to gain the skills they need to enter the workforce. Our budget is very much about trying to ensure all Australians get the opportunity to participate in Australia's economic success.

           The budget is very much about helping get more Australians into work, particularly those who perhaps would struggle to enter the workforce. While some parts of the country are crying out for workers there are areas of our economy and our regions that are at risk of being left behind where unemployment is at significantly higher levels. Australians who face disadvantage, many who face multiple disadvantages, are being kept out of the workforce.
          </p>
          <p>
           A key focus of the government's Building Australia's Future Workforce budget package is increasing workforce participation by giving disadvantaged Australians the skills and encouragement they need to get a job. In particular, the package is focused on supporting disadvantaged young people, the very long-term unemployed, jobless families and people with a disability so that they have the best chance of becoming job ready and finding and keeping a job. It is about investing in skills and allowing people the chance to participate in the economy giving them an opportunity.

             The Building Australia's Future Workforce package very much targets each of the areas where people are facing disadvantage. We have encouraged more young Australians into work be it part time or full time by allowing jobseekers on youth allowance to keep more of what they earn through increasing the income area and increasing the working credit. We are providing single principal carer parents on Newstart allowance a more generous taper rate enabling them to earn up to $400 more per fortnight and retain some allowance and there will be 35,000 wage subsidies over the next four years for employers who take on the very long-term unemployed. We are also increasing the number of places in language, literacy and numeracy programs to assist jobseekers to improve their skills. All of these measures are about giving all Australians the opportunity to participate in economic activity, to gain access to employment and improve their life chances and the life chances of their children. I ask that further questions be placed on the
