         I thank Senator Cash for her question. It's interesting to note that it's taken three of the opposition's questions to get to the issue of tourism as it relates to the issues that the opposition have been raising today.

         I'll take that interjection, Senator Ruston, and, no, I won't be filibustering. I'll be answering the question that I—

          President, a point of order in relation to relevance. It is now well over 30 seconds into the answer. It was a very specific question in relation to airfares for Australians and whether or not they would be higher or lower as a result of the government's decision.

           I will remind the minister of his question, but I will also remind all senators in this place that the minister is entitled to take interjections. There was an interjection, which the minister also responded to, but I have reminded him of the question and I would ask all senators to listen in silence.

            The reality is this: there is significant downward pressure on airfares at the moment. One of the reasons for that is that we, as a government, are correcting all of the problems that you created during the pandemic in terms of the ability of Australians to travel in and out of this country.

                President, a point of order on direct relevance. This was a one-sentence question asked by Senator Cash. It went very precisely to a decision taken by the government in relation to
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways" rel="nofollow">
                 Qatar Airways
                </a>
                . As enlightening as it may be for the senator to go through a bunch of other decisions that may or may not have been taken, to be directly relevant to the question asked he should address the decision that he is being asked about, not other decisions.

                  On the point of order: the question was about price, and, last time I looked, supply and demand are relevant to price. The deputy leader and trade minister is going through the ways in which the government's policies are increasing the supply of flights in and out of Australia. It's entirely relevant. I know that economics is no longer relevant to you now you're in opposition. I know you don't want to let economics get in the way of politics—
