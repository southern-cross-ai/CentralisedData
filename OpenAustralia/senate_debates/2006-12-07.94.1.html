        My question is to Senator Kemp representing the Minister for Human Services. Will the minister inform the Senate what action the Australian government is taking to assist people affected by the Victorian bushfires?

         I thank the senator for his question and his ongoing concern for and interest in the welfare of people in regional and rural Australia. The communities of the alpine region in north-eastern Victoria are bracing for one of the worst bushfire weekends ever. With temperatures tipped to reach the high 30s again this weekend, emergency services across the state are hoping to contain fires threatening communities large and small. The Australian government is monitoring the bushfire situation closely and will provide whatever support is needed, should it be required.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday the Attorney-General approved a request from the Victorian government to provide Army fuel tankers in the firefighting effort. These Army fuel tankers will supply diesel for water tankers and engineering plants in the Mansfield-Whitfield region.

         has also activated the Commonwealth disaster plan, which provides a framework for the provision of Australian federal government assistance to state and territory governments when their resources are exhausted by the scale of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian government agencies are also assisting those affected by these bushfires. Centrelink is working with the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment to assist them in providing call centre services to people affected by the Victorian bushfires. In fact, the Geelong call centre is geared up to provide a 24/7 call service if required. Centrelink area offices in Victoria have put in place emergency procedures to enable them to respond to the bushfiresâ€”again, should it be required. This includes staff, particularly social workers, being on call to attend state evacuation centres to speak to people affected by the fires. I am advised Centrelink is ready to act if the Australian government makes a disaster declaration, in order to assist citizens to claim the Australian government disaster recovery payment.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am sure I speak for all senators and the Australian government in expressing the hope that emergency services can contain these bushfires in the north-east of Victoria soon and that no lives will be lost. The reality is that communities and residents will need to activate their fire plans and prepare for a tough weekend ahead. This is already one of the worst bushfire seasons on record and our thoughts are with all those fighting these fires and particularly those affected. The Australian government stands ready to respond and assist any state or territory in need of additional resources or support.
