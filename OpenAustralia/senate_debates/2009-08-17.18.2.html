           To take the interjection from my colleague Senator Abetz, we have said that it will be a four- to five-year rollout. But, in terms of the first connections and the first services to be provided, we have said that that will be by, I think, July next year. I do not think I can be clearer than that, Senator Abetz.

They relate to the equity contribution and the take-up assumptions by the government. The minister has not addressed either of those questions. I would ask you to draw his attention to the questions.

                   , on the point of order, what we now have is the opposition restating their question rather than going to the substance of the issue. The minister has over half a minute left to provide an answer to the question. Again we are in this position where the opposition are just jumping up midway through the answer to a question and arguing that it is not directly relevant. My submission is that the minister is being directly relevant to the question and that there is sufficient time to continue to be directly relevant to the question and provide all of the information that the opposition have asked for.

                     Let me be clear: the Tasmanian and the national governments’ broadband rollout in Tasmania is currently the subject of a tender process. We are actually seeking to purchase the fibre. Depending on the outcome of a ‘live’ tender process, we will potentially be able to answer all of that question. There are many parts of the rollout yet to be tendered for.

                       That entire question is based on a string of assumptions that are fundamentally incorrect. It is impossible to answer a question that is based on hypothetical assumptions that were in the newspaper this morning and that have nothing to do with the project. It could not be clearer than that. ‘If there is only this take-up’—how can one possibly answer a question that is based on a hypothetical? So let me be clear: Tasmania currently has the worst and most expensive broadband in this country. That is your legacy—yours and yours and yours. You can put out all the press releases you want—

                         , I could not possibly blame you, though. But those opposite from Tasmania have left the state of Tasmania in a state of disrepair when it comes to broadband.

                           , that that question is based on facts; it is just based on a simple assertion. You have no basis to make that assertion whatsoever. I think the answer to the factual part of your question—and I am happy to come back and add to this—is that the directors of the T

                           Co. will be paid around $40,000. I am not sure that that has been absolutely finalised at this point in time, but it is around $40,000. The TNBN Co. executive chair, Mr Doug Campbell, is being paid, I think, $210,000 to be the chair and the
