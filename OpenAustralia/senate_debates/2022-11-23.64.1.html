        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Watt. The regulatory impact statement for the government's industrial relations legislation says that the department has costed marketing consultants by using an article entitled 'How much should I charge as a consultant in Australia?' from a website called authentic.com.au. The author of that article is described on the website as:

            I am aware of this incident, and I'm also aware that a departmental spokesperson from the department has already addressed this point by saying that the link was used as part of an internal desktop review which used a range of online sources to determine an indicative cost as part of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS" rel="nofollow">
             RIS
            </a>
            . This included websites such as the

              AFR

            </i>
            . Do you have an issue with that one? It included Payscale. Do you have an issue with that one? It included Talent.com and

             LinkedIn
            </a>
            . Do you have issues with those as well? The departmental spokesperson has gone on to say that it was incorrect to use the link as being the only source referenced in that section of the RIS. The department apologises—

              and Talent.com and Payscale and things like that, but apparently they do. The truth here is that the opposition—what they really object to is any change to an industrial relations system that has kept wages low, kept productivity low and impeded economic growth. That's what—

                   Thank you. As I say, there is nothing that gets the coalition going more than the prospect of keeping wages low. That's what they did for the 10 years they were in government, and that's what they're determined to do—even though they lost the last election, even when our government got a mandate to get wages moving again. This mob over here are so determined to hold workers back from getting a pay rise that they will continually oppose it. They will come up with scare campaign after scare campaign, anything at all, to keep wages low. And why? Because it was a deliberate feature of their economic policy, and they're determined to pursue that in opposition just as they did it for 10 years in government.

                  <p>
                   Do you know what will actually make our economy stronger? It is higher wages and higher productivity. Do you know how we're going to do that? By delivering these industrial relations reforms that the people of Australia voted for and this mob still haven't woken up to, and they're pursuing the old fights and the old conflict to hold wages low.

                     The same regulatory impact statement on page 46 references an article entitled 'How much do payroll services cost?' on a website called bark.com, which lists its most popular services as dog and pet grooming, dog training, dog walking, life coaching, limousine hire, magicians and private investigators. Is this an acceptable source for a government department to use to calculate bargaining costs for businesses?

                             I would have sat Senator Birmingham down, but there was so much disorder in the chamber he could not hear me. I would once again ask all senators to refrain from shouting out. It's not a football match; it is the Senate chamber, where a little bit of rowdiness is fine but not the pitch at which it is currently being delivered.
