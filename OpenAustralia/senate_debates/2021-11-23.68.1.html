        and the Pacific, Senator Seselja, who, I note, is freshly returned from a successful trip to Fiji. With Australia's border reopening as part of the government's national plan, can the minister update the Senate on how workers from the Pacific and Timor-Leste are contributing to Australia's rural economy, helping to secure jobs and supporting economic growth both in Australia and across our region as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic?

         I thank Senator Scarr, who is a champion of Australia's relations with the Pacific. I'm pleased to advise that we have almost 19,000 Pacific and Timorese workers in Australia—the most ever. Since our Pacific labour initiatives recommenced in September last year, more than 14,000 Pacific workers have arrived from seven participating Pacific nations and Timor-Leste. Between now and Christmas a further 2,000 Pacific workers will arrive to assist with the harvest period and a further 55,000 Pacific workers are ready and waiting to come to Australia. This is immediate action to address critical workforce shortages across regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pacific labour mobility is also expanding, and is now involved in more sectors. Pacific workers are helping to bring in harvests, process meat, care for our elderly and staff our hospitality venues as we look to bounce back after COVID-19. The government recognises the outstanding job Pacific and Timorese workers have done in critical industries in Australia throughout the pandemic, particularly in agriculture. These workers have played a vital role in many rural industries, including: Samoan aged-care workers in Katherine in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         ; Fijian meat workers in Inverell in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         ; and

          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         horticultural workers in Clifton in Senator Scarr's home state of Queensland. On average, a longer-term Pacific worker will send remittances of more than $40,000 home over a three-year placement. This is an economic stimulus that directly allows our workers to support family, educate their kids and build homes, and it serves as a life-changing economic investment in our region. This makes Pacific labour much greater than just a win-win initiative within the region. It's essential for our Pacific family, and we're committed to its future.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, as Christmas approaches we should also take a moment to pause and express our gratitude to these Pacific workers who will be away from family and their communities at this important time of year. I thank our Pacific family for the invaluable contribution they're making—

             I thank you, and I'm looking forward to the second as well. Today we have announced the next stage of reforms to the Pacific-Australia Labour Mobility scheme. The changes follow extensive public consultation with Pacific island countries and our domestic industries, which will see a consolidated, improved and more efficient Pacific worker scheme benefitting employers, workers and participating countries. From 4 April 2022 the Seasonal Worker Program and Pacific Labour Scheme will be consolidated and replaced by an improved

             scheme, simplifying administration and reducing duplication. The new single PALM scheme will be managed by the

             and its provider, the Pacific Labour Facility.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're also enhancing our commitment to skills and training as part of these reforms, with more opportunities for PALM workers to access job-specific training. These reforms will benefit employers, workers and participating nations, marking a new era of growth and success for Australia and the Pacific.

                scheme will enable rural and regional businesses to engage the right workers more easily, where and when they need them, alleviating critical workforce shortages. Visa arrangements will also be simplified with a single PALM visa stream offering an extended length of stay of up to four years, and the option to recruit workers for seasonal roles or longer-term positions. We're also introducing more flexibilities for workers to move between employers in response to workforce demands, improving productivity and workers' earning capacity. The PALM scheme will further improve the high standards of program integrity and worker wellbeing that are central to the ongoing success of Pacific labour mobility. This is an exciting new era in Pacific labour mobility. These programs are win-win for Australia and our Pacific family. We look forward to welcoming more Pacific workers and the invaluable contribution they make in Australia.
