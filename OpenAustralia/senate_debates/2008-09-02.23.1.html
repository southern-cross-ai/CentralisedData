        My question is to the

         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        , Senator Faulkner. I refer to the minister’s answer yesterday where he informed the Senate that the government staffing committee has suspended its investigation into the CMAX affair and his undertaking that the government would fully cooperate with the Auditor-General’s investigation. Given that in his correspondence of 20 August 2008 the Auditor-General wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The audit will have regard to the outcome of the review being undertaken by the Government Staffing Committee in respect of the engagement process—

        I ask the minister: has the government deliberately suspended the inquiry to frustrate the Auditor-General’s investigation?

        </small>
        <p>
         The answer to that question of course is no, and it is a very offensive suggestion. The reason the Government Staffing Committee has suspended its inquiry is that that is absolutely the proper and appropriate thing to do in these circumstances. It is absolutely appropriate that the Auditor-General be able to conduct his inquiry and all his deliberations in relation to this performance audit without any suggestion of interference or ongoing process from the government at all. I am very surprised that an experienced senator like Senator Fierravanti-Wells would not understand that extremely important principle.
        </p>
        <p>
         The principle here is very simple: the Auditor-General should be able to do his work on this performance audit, which is something that the opposition itself has supported—the opposition wants the Auditor-General to do this performance audit—without any suggestion that there is any interference at all from anyone involved in the political process, whether it be on the government’s side of the chamber or the opposition’s side of the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         I happen to think that that is an important principle. I am disappointed that the opposition does not support that important principle, but reinforce what I said to the Senate yesterday in relation to this matter and I said also to the Senate last week: it is the view of the government that the—

          , I rise on a point of order. I was very specific, and perhaps I should repeat it for the minister. My quote was very specific, and it was: ‘The audit will have regard to the outcome of the review being undertaken by the Government Staffing Committee in respect of the engagement process.’ The question was very simple. I ask the minister: have you deliberately suspended the inquiry to frustrate the Auditor-General’s investigation?

           , I think the senator is confused. I thought she was taking a point of order, not asking a supplementary question. I think she got confused while she was on her feet, but I would like you to rule as to whether that was a point of order or a supplementary question.

             I do not accept the slur that is insinuated in the question that the government would not fully cooperate with the Auditor-General’s inquiry. I have said it will. I do not say ‘it will’ lightly. The government will fully cooperate with the Auditor-General’s inquiry and I say again to the opposition, through you,

             : it would be inappropriate for those government processes to continue and conclude while the Auditor-General is conducting his performance audit. I repeat the commitments that I gave to this chamber in relation to the questions that were asked of me previously.

                 What we need here is a full and unfettered inquiry by the Auditor-General. The opposition needs, before it asks silly supplementary questions like this, to remember whether Mr Vaile or Mr Nairn were stood down when the Auditor-General investigated the Regional Partnerships program. Of course they were not. Was Dr Wooldridge asked to stand down when the Auditor-General investigated the
