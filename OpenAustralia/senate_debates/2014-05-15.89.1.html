        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. I refer the minister to the legacy left by Labor of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        that has been hollowed out by a defence budget that has been gutted to the tune of $16 billion. Can the minister inform the Senate of how the budget reaffirms the coalition government's commitment to defence?

         I thank the senator for his question and his longstanding interest in defence matters. The task to restore the defence budget is, as we all know on this side of the chamber, monumental. Those on the other side have been talking about deceit. Well, the architects of deceit—the people who wrote the book on it—are sitting over there when it comes to the defence budget. They had absolutely no qualms in ripping $16 billion out of the last four years of the defence budget. They told everybody they had a plan. They gave us a white paper in 2009. They had no plan and they had an unfunded white paper. In terms of finance the defence portfolio was an unsustainable mess. The first thing I was told in coming to the portfolio by the department was that the Defence Capability Plan is in financial disarray and the 2009 white paper aspirations are unaffordable. There is deceit for you. There is a monumental lie perpetrated on the Australian people. Labor left this important—

            Australian Strategic Policy Institute
           </a>
           as 'an unsustainable mess'. In fact, the previous government slashed 10.5 per cent from the 2012-13 budget, the biggest cut since the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" rel="nofollow">
            Korean War

           , taking us back to a share of

           for defence to 1938 levels. They moved 119 programs—programs often relating to men and women in the field in Afghanistan and their protection—to the right, delayed another eight and cancelled another 48 whilst we were fighting a war.

                GDP

               at 1.6 per cent—not seen since 1938 levels. We took that figure on Tuesday night to 1.8 per cent of GDP, on the road to the two per cent that we promised. The numbers are there for all to see. We on this side of the chamber are dinkum about Australia's defence. We are serious about protecting the men and women and the vital energy industries that go to East Asia into the future, come what may.
