        My question is to Senator Conroy, the Minister representing the Treasurer. In light of today’s updated Treasury forecasts, will the government direct Treasury to conduct further modelling on the impact of Labor’s proposed

          IMF

         forecasts which have been released in the last few days have indicated the magnitude of the worldwide recession. The government is also, unlike those opposite, facing up to the climate change challenge and is going to press ahead with its

         . We have modelled it, we have worked through these issues and we are completely confident that the world economic recession will not allow us to be deflected—unlike those opposite, who are torn between those wanting to support their leader and those who want to support their leader in this chamber. Those who are climate change sceptics, those who are non-believers in climate change, let us be clear—

            The Treasury engaged in the largest modelling exercise that we have ever seen in this country before we released the paper. Let us be clear about this: those opposite can choose to put their head in the sand and continue to be deniers or they can get on board.

              Unlike those opposite, I know Mr Howes well, and I have a very high regard for Mr Howes’s skills. But, when it comes to economic analysis, forecasting and Treasury modelling, I will stick with Treasury—no disrespect to Mr Howes, whom I consider a friend. When it comes to the impact of the scheme, I will go with Treasury any day of the week—any day of the week when it comes to the modelling. I am very confident that Treasury know a little bit more about this than Mr Howes, and that is no disrespect whatsoever to Mr Howes, a man for whom, as I said, I have a high regard.

                The Treasury modelling released in October 2008 demonstrated that economies that defer action face long-term costs that are around 15 per cent higher than those that take action now. So those opposite who want to defer, delay and deny will be putting a greater cost on this economy and Australian workers and families by the position that they are taking and now advocating—once again, inconsistent with Mr Turnbull’s position. Those opposite who want to try and argue that they have some—
