        Tonight I rise to acknowledge the impending 80th birthday of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rt_Hon" rel="nofollow">
         Rt Hon
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Fraser" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Fraser
        </a>
        , who was born on 29 May 1930. This is a celebration of an impressive birthday milestone, but it is also the celebration of a man who has been an outstanding figure in Australia’s history as a nation. Of Malcolm Fraser’s eight decades, 28 years were dedicated to parliamentary service, with eight years as Prime Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        At their core, Malcolm Fraser and the Australian psyche share a common blend of traits: grit, humility, determination and aspiration. Neither one’s genesis predestined greatness; both emerged from adversity stronger and greater nonetheless. Malcolm Fraser’s creed is wrought in perseverance, and it is because of this that history records the restoration of responsible government in 1975. It is because of this that the Australian economy was able to thrive once again. It is because of this that Australia turned to a leader with an intense commitment to integrity in public administration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we look back on a government that wrote into the pages of history some of Australia’s greatest environmental protections. The cessation of sand mining on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Fraser Island
        </a>
        and the prohibition of whaling in Australian waters are among them. We look back to a time when Australia’s 22nd Prime Minister became the first to adopt a migration program that was truly multiracial, when government policies were inspired by an indomitable belief in the Australian fair go. The trajectory of the Fraser government is something to behold in the index of this nation’s history. Malcolm Fraser has not merely lived history; he has made it, changed it and charted us a better course for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1975 Australia was in the throes of a national heart attack. While prepared to inflict short-term pain to avert impending disaster, the spirit of Malcolm Fraser’s intent was that of a healer and a builder. With the balm of confidence and the tonic of optimism, he reached out to all Australians with hope and assurance. He continued to instil reassurance and stability throughout his government, recruiting other healers like

        Fraser immigration ministers set the course for non-discriminatory migration programs. It was that government that loudly resolved the recently abolished

        policy would never again blot any page of legislation passed in our federal parliament. It was their government that organised the calm and orderly arrival of 100,000 Indochinese. They were welcomed to Australia where their future citizenship would never be questioned and their dreams could be boundless. As

        Imagine a time when there was a bipartisan national discussion on immigration that appealed to our best hopes and not our worst fears. Imagine a time when the immigration minister conducted a national tour to explain multiculturalism and was often joined by his opposition shadow.

        Malcolm Fraser has had a lifelong aversion to communism. Given the times in which he reached adulthood in 1950s Australia, it is easy to understand why. As Prime Minister, he backed the United States in its condemnation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. But he also swam against the prevailing international tides of the time which included the more relaxed attitude of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Jimmy_Carter" rel="nofollow">
         President Jimmy Carter

        ’s administration towards the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Soviet Union
        </a>
        . Fraser argued this stance weakened the position of the West which was critical during the Cold War period, and that was a view later endorsed by

        Throughout all of this time, the member for Wannon was an outstanding local member of parliament. During Malcolm Fraser’s prime ministership, I served on my children’s local kindergarten committee in his electorate. I once wrote to him about an issue concerning our kindergarten, unsure whether I would receive a reply. Two weeks later the member for Wannon responded with care and concern. I remember being very impressed by his attention to a minor detail while attending to the great challenges of an entire nation. There are those today who would do well to heed such an example.

        In 1981, Ronald Reagan said that it was Malcolm Fraser who preceded both him and

        who was a Treasurer and an early champion of liberal markets? Alexander Downer was a former staffer to Malcolm Fraser. In his words, Fraser ‘was one of the most dedicated and patriotic people I have ever met.’ The Fraser government received a majority in both houses, but Australians remained bitterly divided over the events that led to that moment. Alexander Downer’s view is that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some Liberals say Fraser should have reformed the economy more radically than he did. But all prime ministers operate in a context and the context of post November, 1975, is important to understand.
       </p>
       <p>
        After more than a century of Federation, Australia has five living former prime ministers. They should all be celebrated and respected for the service they gave with all of their might and to the best extent of their abilities that the challenges of their times allowed. Malcolm Fraser was not a perfect prime minister. He is not a flawless human being. Who among us is? But it was the aspiration to better, to develop and to refine his abilities and to progress from a beginning that was not predestined for greatness that also speaks to his qualities of determination and aspiration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some may say that Malcolm Fraser let the opportunity of radical reform slide, but with the wisdom of hindsight they may now concede that legislating for the sake of opportunity has its drawbacks too. It was a time for calm, reasoned progression, not for legislation that sought to reach beyond what the public was prepared to grasp.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Fraser is a person of remarkable consistency, without lacking in adaptability. His established views on the importance of federalism are now more relevant than ever. When Malcolm Fraser left the Liberal leadership, he left our party in capable hands and I want to pay tribute to him tonight.
