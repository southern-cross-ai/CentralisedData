        , my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities—which, surprisingly, is Senator Conroy. Minister, can you please explain the varied positions of the Labor Party. Senator Wong stated on 1 June 2009:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the final decision on the Basin Plan rests with the Commonwealth Minister for Water alone..
       </p>
       <p>
        Then, on 10 August, Prime Minister Gillard said they were ‘determined’ to do what was necessary to implement the Murray-Darling Basin plan. Then the most recent minister, Minister Burke, said on the 26th:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The guide is not government policy, it is not my document, I have deliberately made sure I did not launch it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Who are we to believe: minister 1, Minister Wong; minister 2, Minister Burke; or the Prime Minister?

         I thank Senator Joyce for his question. It gives me the opportunity to answer the question. The key is that, Senator Joyce, you are factually wrong. Senator Joyce was talking about different things. He was trying to compare apples with oranges—comments about apples compared with comments about oranges. But that is no great surprise. This is a senator who yesterday stood up and offered to table a document he was given in confidence. He was given an advance copy of a document and he wanted to wave it around pretending it was a public document.

          , this has to be, if ever there was, an issue of relevance. There is not one thing in this answer that is addressing this question. In fact he is going on to something entirely different. Please pull him into line.

            . As I was saying, Senator Joyce is attempting to take comments about a guide and comments on a plan and pretend they are the same thing. They are separate things; one came before the other. They are completely consistent with each other. The fact that Senator Joyce is now going to have to explain to Senator Abetz and the tactics committee that he has been sprung misleading the chamber by trying to pretend they were the same things is something Senator Joyce will have to deal with. The whole premise of his question is completely false. It just shows the desperation of those opposite that they would try—

                        , Senator Joyce continues to try and verbal Minister Burke, Minister Wong and the Prime Minister. It is a complete verballing. The whole premise of his question is wrong. We have been very consistent in our view. We have taken legal advice and now we are going to table it, as I think Minister Burke has indicated. So let us be clear about this: we have been completely consistent in our statements on these matters and we, like many others, like many stakeholders, are concerned. Minister Burke visited Griffith just recently and they are very concerned there about this report as it stands at the moment. Let me be very clear about this. We have been entirely consistent.

Senator Joyce has attempted three times now to verbal not only Minister Burke and Minister Wong but the Prime Minister. He should be ashamed of himself for that.
