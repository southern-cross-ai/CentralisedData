        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_McCarthy" rel="nofollow">
         Senator McCarthy

        . The government has said that it is committed to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, state and territory governments and the Coalition of Peaks to close the gap on a range of outcomes including health, education, justice and jobs. Can the new minister please explain how the government's approach will help to close the gap in employment outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Australians?

         I thank Senator Ghosh for the question. I look forward to getting over to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         in the near future. Certainly as the new Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , I'm deeply committed to work in partnership with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         communities and organisations and state and territory governments to improve outcomes for First Nations people.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the 2022 election we promised to get rid of the failed Community Development Program, or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP" rel="nofollow">
          CDP
         </a>
         . It failed individuals and communities and left people stuck in cycles of poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had my first meeting as minister with our First Nations Reference Group for the Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program, continuing the important work of my predecessor,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Burney" rel="nofollow">
          Linda Burney
         </a>
         . The group has incredible knowledge and experience in remote employment and economic development. And it's providing important advice to the government on the implementation program which will help close the gap in employment outcomes and boost economic opportunities in remote areas.
        </p>
        <p>
         It will be tough. We are doing this, though, in partnership with First Nations people. We know that, by working together, we will get better outcomes. The remote jobs program will create 3,000 jobs in remote communities. It is the first stage in meeting our commitment to replace the CDP with real jobs, proper wages and decent conditions, including superannuation, annual leave and sick leave. The new remote jobs program will mean Indigenous Australians can have access to the benefits and dignity of work no matter where they live. This will be life-changing for many people in remote communities. We believe that those in remote communities deserve, like all Australians, to access the benefits and dignity of work.

            The remote jobs program will initially create 3,000 jobs with proper wages and decent conditions. It is the first stage in the transition to replace the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP" rel="nofollow">
             CDP
            </a>
            . The program is about self-determination through economic and community development, jobs that local communities want and need to grow remote economies. The new remote jobs program will build up local skills for the local care economy, services and maintenance.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know that the old CDP program was a failure, and it simply didn't deliver for remote Australia. We've been trialling and testing new approaches to job creation in remote communities to help inform how we best replace CDP. We're working with Indigenous communities to design and implement the programs communities want. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             Productivity Commission
            </a>
            highlighted the importance of listening, and that's what we're doing. But we're also putting communities in the driver seat to create local jobs and businesses.
