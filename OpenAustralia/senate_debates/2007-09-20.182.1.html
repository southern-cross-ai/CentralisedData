        This is our standard amendment, which would remove the discrimination against same-sex couples, which is inherent in this bill—and, I might say, as we found in the inquiry that was conducted, the report of which was tabled today, is inherent in 58 acts. That was discovered by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">

        and

         Equal Opportunity Commission
        </a>
        . It is our view that it is time to end the discrimination against same-sex couples, and this amendment would have the effect of doing that.

         I indicate that the Labor Party, consistent with practice, will be supporting this amendment. Whilst we have had the view over the question of discrimination against same-sex couples that we wanted to have a comprehensive response to that issue—and we would do that if we were fortunate enough to gain government in this country—in this case we will support this amendment from Senator Allison. While I have the opportunity, I ask the minister: where is the logic that says that the teeth of an individual are the responsibility of the state and yet the health of the rest of the body of the individual is the responsibility of the Commonwealth?

          I will address both issues. Firstly, the same-sex couples issue: Senator Allison, I understand the amendment you are trying to move. I do not think this is the time or the place to address that issue again. There are no plans to change current government policy at this time. I will just leave it at that. I suspect that at some other time there will be a debate on the issue. In relation to Senator McLucas’s question about the responsibility for health, since Federation the primary health care of Australians has been, primarily, the responsibility of state governments.
