        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Women, Senator Wong. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance—who is helpfully also the Minister for Women—have told us that this budget will have a focus on addressing the cost of living. We have also heard the Minister for Women tell us many times that women's economic equality is a core economic imperative and a central focus of the Albanese Labor government. Ahead of tonight's budget, can the minister tell us how the Albanese government has so far supported women's economic security and helped them manage the cost of living?

         I thank Senator Stewart for her question. We are fortunate on this side to have so many women gracing the Labor ranks and in this chamber. We are also fortunate to have the Minister for Women and the Minister for Finance, Senator Katy Gallagher, who has made clear the importance of ensuring women's economic security. That is what our government has been doing—working to ensure women have economic security through both our policies and our investments.

         Our tax cuts will provide greater relief to low- and middle-income taxpayers, who are disproportionally women. From 1 July, women will receive—

        <p>
         The senator opposite might like to know that the women who perhaps voted for her will receive bigger tax cuts under the tax cuts we proposed. Women will receive an average tax cut of $1,649, nearly $400 more than they would have received under those opposite. Treasury modelling suggests Labor's tax cuts will also boost participation, which is an important thing for women across this country and the economy.

             I do wish to continue, and I would hope Senator Hughes would be happy at the improved economic position of women as a consequence of the government's policies. I would hope that she would think it is a good thing to increase paid parental leave. I would hope she thinks it is a good thing to make paid parental leave flexible and accessible. I would also hope—it is a good thing—that all of us would support the government's work to tackle gender based violence. The strategy for gender equality which was set out last year had this as one of its key priorities.

               We know that there is not one simple solution that will deliver women's economic equality. While the gender pay gap in Australia is at its lowest since recording began, at 12 per cent, there is a persistent gender pay gap and much work to do. Can the minister outline how the government is working to close gender pay gaps?

                In February the Workplace Gender Equality Agency published employer gender pay gaps for the first time. I know Senator Canavan was not particularly supportive of the fact that the gender pay gap data was released, but it is important for greater transparency. That is in part what helps reduce the gender pay gap. In every industry in Australia, the median of what a woman is paid is less than the median of what a man is paid, both for base salary and for total remuneration. That is why it is so important that we continue to press for greater transparency to help close the gender pay gap.

                demonstrate that continued action is required to close gender pay gaps and advance gender equality in our workplaces. Key to this is valuing the feminised sectors. That is why we are committed to funding increased wages for aged-care workers, child education workers and early childhood workers.
