         I thank Senator Moore for the question. The government is deeply concerned by yesterday’s artillery attack on the Republic of Korea.

         of Korea is, of course, a close friend and partner of Australia and has been for many years. As senators will be aware, yesterday afternoon
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         shelled
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          South Korea
         </a>
         n territory, killing two
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean" rel="nofollow">
          South Korean
         </a>
         soldiers and injuring military personnel and civilians. The Australian government absolutely condemns this act of provocation. It is an act which breaches all international norms and obligations. It is a violation of the 1953 armistice agreement. The government also offers its condolences—and I am sure this is supported by all senators—to the people and nation of the Republic of Korea. Yesterday’s events follow the March attack by a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean" rel="nofollow">
          North Korean
         </a>
         submarine on a South Korean navy vessel that saw 46 lives lost. They also follow recent reports that North Korea is developing a sophisticated uranium enrichment program in defiance of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          UN Security Council
         </a>
         resolutions. This series of events is obviously deeply troubling and threatens stability on the Korean peninsula and, more broadly, in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asia" rel="nofollow">
          North Asia
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         In the face of these provocations the Republic of Korea has acted with restraint. We commend
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Lee" rel="nofollow">
          President Lee
         </a>
         for his calm and capable leadership but, in such a tense and heavily armed environment, the risk of miscalculation and of escalation is ever present. The consequences of such miscalculation could be enormous to our friends in the Republic of Korea and, more broadly, for stability and prosperity in North Asia. I am sure all senators share the concern of the government. We condemn this act of provocation and call on North Korea to cease this sort of provocation.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
            North Korea
           </a>
           to abide by international norms of behaviour and to cease its hostile acts. We call on North Korea to abide by the 1953 armistice agreement and we call on North Korea to make a genuine commitment to abandon its nuclear program. The Australian government is closely monitoring the situation, including reviewing travel advisories for the region. All Australians in

           should continue to monitor developments carefully through the local media and follow the advice of local authorities. The government will make further advice available as the situation develops.

              Korean War

              South Korea

             of Korea, the United States, Japan and the European Union have all condemned the attack. We are urging China and others in the region and beyond to use their influence on
