        I rise tonight to acknowledge the life of Ms Dhu, a young 22-year-old Yamatji woman, a woman described by her mother as 'bubbly', 'family oriented' and as her 'beautiful baby'. Her grandmother said Ms Dhu was 'full of life', 'a happy-go-lucky spirit' and that she would give you the last thing which she had. But sadly and distressingly, Ms Dhu will be remembered as the woman who died an agonising death after being locked up in a police cell in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        for just over $3,000 in fines. Here is the chronology of Ms Dhu's death:

       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p>
        This was a young life cut way too short. Ms Dhu was the victim of a brutal system, a system which is racist at its core—a racist system which means Aboriginal people fear the police; a system which clearly failed to show due respect and care to Ms Dhu; a racist system which ended Ms Dhu's life. May Ms Dhu's spirit rest in peace.
