        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

        </a>
        , Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Yesterday the minister was forced to correct her misleading statements made in the Senate on Tuesday and Wednesday about the impact of Labor's sensible reforms to dividend imputation cash refunds. Given it is the government's entire argument that is misleading and not just her confusion between earnings and taxable income, when will the minister withdraw her misleading statement in its entirety?

The question is entirely within order, as ministers can be questioned about their statements.

                   I gave a statement to the Senate yesterday. That statement deals with the issue. Go and have a look at my statement, Senator Sterle.

                  <p>
                   Now I will deal with that part of your question that is pertinent to my portfolio, and that is that Labor's policy will take money from the pockets of 230,000 pensioners and part-pensioners. It is clear from the way Labor has designed this policy that it is to take money out of the pockets of pensioners. We know this. When the policy was introduced by the Howard government, with the support of those opposite, it was deliberately designed to put money into people's pockets. Pensioners with shares who will be negatively affected by this policy include age pensioners, war widows and war widowers, veterans, disability support pensioners and carers.

                   , there are 21,011 pensioners who are affected by this. So you go and explain to them the money that you're taking out of their pockets, Senator Sterle—21,000 of them!

                     Yes, I do. While making the misleading statement on Tuesday, the minister claimed in relation to Labor's proposed reform of dividend imputation cash refunds, 'It's a bit like

You are taking thousands of dollars out of the pockets of pensioners at the same time as you are exempting groups associated with your union mates. That shows your priority, Senator Sterle.

                                  I rise on a point of order. It relates to debate yesterday, and we've heard that behaviour from those opposite again today. Several comments from those opposite taken in isolation are one thing, but we've heard again an exchange about 'cats' and 'she'—the discussion about the 'cat's mother' and 'she'. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate referred repeatedly, in a very derogatory way, not to 'the minister' but to 'she'. The

                                  will show that you've also made comments about the minister being a joke. Again, this is a pattern of behaviour and language that I find highly insulting and inappropriate. It is very reminiscent of the shameful behaviour from those opposite towards

I will however remind senators of the rules around parliamentary language, particularly around language that other senators find offensive, and also imputations.

                                            The Turnbull government appreciates that, when investors are making decisions about where to invest, there are a number of factors to consider, and corporate tax rates are a significant one. We know the global economy is very competitive. It's clear that the

                                            Investment in Australia not only drives economic growth but drives job creation. We know that reducing company tax rates will make Australia a more investable proposition. It's disappointing that those opposite refuse to back Australian workers and back Australian jobs by supporting the government's proposed company tax cuts. Given their previous positions, it is a very perplexing situation.

                                               We are absolutely focused on delivering policies which support economic growth and create jobs for Australians. We've already delivered tax relief for small and family businesses around Australia, giving those businesses the freedom to grow and to invest in their own success.

They recognise the importance of investment in creating jobs and raising our standard of living. The government's enterprise tax plan will deliver policy certainty for companies that are looking to invest, and it will consequently increase our attractiveness as a destination for investment.

                                                  It happens that I am aware of risks, unfortunately, and they come in the form of those sitting opposite: the
                                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                                                   Australian Labor Party

                                                  . They're standing in the way of company tax cuts, which means that they're standing in the way of more jobs and more investment in Australia.

                                                  But it's not just their opposition to the government's tax plan that poses a risk to our global reputation as an investment destination; it's their absolute policy inconsistency. I don't often quote Mr Shorten, but let me have a go at this one from the Leader of the Opposition, who said:
                                                 </p>

                                                  Reducing the corporate tax rate … sees more capital flowing into our domestic economy, which will then flow on to workers in the form of higher wages - thereby improving standards of living.
