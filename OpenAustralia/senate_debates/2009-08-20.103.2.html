        I seek leave to incorporate further information in relation to an answer to a question by Senator Bob Brown about the treatment of women in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The answer read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Brown asked a question with respect to the Shia Personal Status Law and its impact on the rights of Shia women. Australia and other members of the international community made our concerns known to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Afghanistan" rel="nofollow">
         Government of Afghanistan
        </a>
        when the law was first considered in March 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At that time, the draft law contained a number of articles which were unacceptable as they severely undermined the rights of Shia women in violation of the Afghan Constitution, which guarantees gender equality, and also Afghanistan’s obligations as signatory of a number of international human rights agreements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        therefore welcomed President Karzai’s decision to ask the Afghan Ministry of Justice to amend those articles which contravened both the Afghan Constitution and international human rights agreements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am advised that the revised law was gazetted on 27 July 2009. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Independent_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission
        </a>
        said the law was a step forward, but despite improvements, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        is concerned that the law still does not meet Afghanistan’s international human rights obligations. This concern is shared by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
         USA
        </a>
        and the European Union.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is monitoring developments in relation to this law. The Government will continue to press the Afghan Government to meet its international obligations, including respect for the equality of women before the law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Brown also asked a question with respect to the practice of men voting on behalf of women in Afghanistan. I am advised that, according to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, no Afghan person can vote on behalf of another.
