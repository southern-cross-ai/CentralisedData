         The Bills
        </a>
        make important reforms to the regulation of occupational health and safety in the Commonwealth. Specifically, they will repeal the current Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 and replace it with model provisions developed by Safe Work Australia and agreed by Workplace Relations Ministers' Council. There will also be provisions specific to the Commonwealth to ensure that the legislation interacts appropriately with existing Commonwealth laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bills have been subject to extensive consultation at a national level, including with employer and employee organisations and state and territory governments. They are informed by the outcomes of an independent expert review which concluded in 2008 and also reflect the stakeholder comments made on an exposure draft released in May 2011 for a three week period.
