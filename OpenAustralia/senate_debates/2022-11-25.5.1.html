        <i>
         Supply Act (No. 1) 2022-2023
        </i>
        and the Supply Bill (No. 3) 2022-2023 currently before the Parliament, this Bill presents a complete view of the proposed annual appropriations for the ordinary services of government for the 2022-23 financial year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill provides appropriations that support the following significant measures in the October 2022 Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Health and Aged Care will receive approximately $3.4 billion across a large number of programs, including around $810 million to support older Australians and the aged care sector with managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and around $314 million for the expansion of eligibility for a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccines to additional people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Services Australia will receive approximately $1.1 billion, of which over $900 million will be provided to support Services Australia's role in emergency responses. Services Australia will also support other lead government agencies to deliver the Government's election commitments such as Abolishing the Cashless Debit Card, Cheaper Child Care, and Fixing the Aged Care Crisis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Industry, Science and Resources will receive approximately $657 million, which includes $344.6 million for the Modern Manufacturing Initiative and the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative. Funding is also provided to support Australian industry to develop domestic manufacturing capabilities and upskill the manufacturing sector workforce, including through supporting local industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        , Energy, the Environment and Water will receive approximately $600 million. The appropriation includes funding for programs such as: Saving Native Species, to support actions to slow the rate of environmental and native species decline; the Driving the Nation initiative to establish the Driving the Nation Fund to invest in cheaper, cleaner transport; and Increasing Security for the Diesel Exhaust Fluid Market. Funding is also provided for the Sustainable Rural Water Use program, Clean Hydrogen Hubs Investment and activities that strengthen Australia's capabilities and presence within Antarctica and Support Australia's scientific leadership and international collaboration amongst Antarctic nations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also contains an Advance to the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFM" rel="nofollow">
         AFM
        </a>
        ) provision of $2.4 billion to provide the Government with the capacity to allocate additional appropriations for urgent and unforeseen expenditure: $2 billion of the AFM provision is set aside for COVID-19 and natural disaster or other national emergency response related expenditure and $400 million for other general urgent and unforeseen expenditure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These AFM provisions are similar to those currently included in the
        <i>
         Supply Act (No. 1) 2022-2023
        </i>
        , except to expand the current provisions that are statutorily limited to COVID-19 related expenditure to also support natural disaster and other national emergency response related expenditure. The expanded AFM provisions would enable the Government to make funding available to events, such as flood and fire, in a timely manner, should the circumstances require. Once the Bill commences, the AFM provisions in the
        <i>
         Supply Act (No. 1) 2022-2023
        </i>
        would no longer be available for allocation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In light of the size of the AFM, the strong accountability and transparency arrangements that have been in place March 2020 will be continued, including a regular media release in weeks when AFMs are issued, which reports and reconciles the use of the AFM provision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the Schedule to the Bill, the Explanatory Memorandum, and the updated 2022-23 Portfolio Budget Statements tabled in the Parliament in relation to the October 2022 Budget.
