         It is the case that the government is pursuing a range of tenders both in the northern and southern basin and the timing of those is determined in terms of administrative efficiency. The fact is—and I understand Senator Joyce’s position on this; he has a concern about water purchase—we were elected with a very clear position in relation to this and, I have to say—

           a very clear position on water purchase. I will take Senator Abetz’s interjection because what he is actually criticising is Mr Turnbull’s policy, which, of course, is not unusual for Senator Abetz. He is actually criticising the concept of water purchase. It was Mr Turnbull who put forward a plan—and I acknowledge this—that included $3.1 billion for water purchase. We are implementing that plan because, of course, Mr Turnbull was unable to deliver on it. We will continue to purchase water. The reason for that is that unlike those—

                As I was saying, it is because we recognise that we have to address the issues of drought, overallocation and climate change, which is the problem we face particularly in the southern part of the basin. In relation to the issue, I assume from Senator Joyce’s question—

                  I was saying that we have closed one tender and reopened another. I assume from the question about finalisation that the good senator refers to the actual finalisation of contracts and transfer arrangements. He asked these questions in estimates and I think he will recall that that can often take some time. My view was that we needed to progress the purchases in both the northern and the southern basin. It is not necessary to await all of the contracts being finalised and all of the trades being registered. As the good senator knows, that can take some time. In fact, our experience of the initial purchase round held last year—the $50 million—was that it did—

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. I admit the minister started answering the first question during the second answer. Now maybe we will get an answer to the first supplementary during the further supplementary. I still want to know how much water they intend to buy from the Lower Balonne. My further supplementary question is this: given the government’s position on the Lower Balonne, what is the target amount of water to be purchased?

                      We have not identified a target for that catchment or any other. There are some environmental groups who have suggested that. There are some communities who have suggested that. That is a matter the government will consider. In relation to the finalisation of purchases, we will release that information, Senator Joyce, when that information is available. As yet the purchases from that tender round, as I understand it—I will check—have not been finalised.
