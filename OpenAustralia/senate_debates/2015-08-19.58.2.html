        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Attorney-General's confirmation that he spoke with Commissioner Heydon about his planned address to the Liberal Party fundraiser, the

And would next time you do pick up the phone to the commissioner, will you ask him why he did not ask a single question on the brief of evidence provided to him of the $1.4 million that

          They are getting a little sensitive, aren't they? Senator Conroy is now using the opportunity to wage his own vendettas in the fratricidal ugly world of Labor Party politics. In relation to the first part of the question, I would have to check but I would do recall communicating with Mr Heydon on the occasion when the government approached him to request that he extend the life of the royal commission. Obviously as a matter of courtesy it was necessary to make that request of him. I cannot immediately call to mind at any other occasions when I have spoken to Mr Heydon during the currency of the royal commission, but I will check.
         </p>
         <p>
          In relation to the second part of Senator Conroy's question, if I understood it correctly and I am sure I did, I am being chastised for failing to interfere with the operation of the royal commission, being chastised for not suggesting to or insisting that the commissioner pursue a certain line of inquiry in a certain way. Well, of course I would not. Anybody who sought to interfere with a royal commission would be committing a crime.

            Mr Heydon was selected by the government on my recommendation because I was looking for somebody with a reputation so stainless, so perfect that nobody could possibly criticise him without making themselves a fool, and you have fallen ride into the trap, Senator Conroy. Anybody who inquired into corruption in the trade union movement was bound to have mire and dirt and sleaze thrown at them by the protectors of the organised criminals in the trade union movement on the opposition benches.

             , I rise on a point of order: direct relevance. I would ask you to draw the attention of the attorney to the specific questions asked about the shortlist and criteria. The attorney has talked about the fact that it was his decision and that is fine, but I would like to see whether you could draw to his attention those particular points in the questions.
