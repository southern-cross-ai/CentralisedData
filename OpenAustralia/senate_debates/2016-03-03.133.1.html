          Despite the interjections from those on the other side, I can assure you, given Senator O'Sullivan's background, that he is fundamentally committed to gender equality, in particular to reducing violence against women and girls.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government is committed to promoting gender equality across the Public Service and private sectors. One of the initiatives that we have recently instituted is that we have relocated the BoardLinks program into the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
           Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
          </a>
          to ensure that a whole-of-government approach is applied to promoting more women onto government boards and into leadership roles.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am pleased to say that there are already a number of examples across the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Public Service
          </a>
          where departments are taking the lead to increase gender diversity within their workplaces—for example, Treasury's Progressing Women Initiative. Treasury made it a strategic business priority to achieve gender equality, particularly in senior leadership.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recently launched with Minister Bishop the gender equality and empowerment strategy. What this strategy is aimed at is driving progress in three areas, and those three areas are fundamental to gender equality. They include ending violence against women and girls, something I would hope that all of us in this chamber are committed to; women's economic empowerment; and women's participation in leadership and, of course, peace building.
         </p>
         <p>
          And, of course, there is Defence's Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. I note that the Minister for Defence herself is fundamentally committed to gender equality. Her department has a gender diversity strategy to ensure that Defence becomes an employer of choice for men and women alike.

                   I am delighted, and I would hope that all of us in this chamber recognise, that in December 2015
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
                    COAG
                   </a>
                   really for the first time ever made landmark decisions in relation to a collective approach to reducing violence against women and girls. They have agreed on a standard of perpetrator interventions to ensure that interventions with perpetrators are based on evidence, effective and implemented consistently around Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   COAG has also agreed to introduce a national domestic violence order scheme. Anybody who has worked with victims of domestic violence or worked in the sector would know that this is something that the sector have been crying for for years and years and years. COAG has finally agreed to implement such a system, and I am pleased to say that every jurisdiction will introduce laws within its parliament in the first half of 2016 to make this happen. Again, these are landmark decisions, and I would hope that all in this chamber appreciate that.

                     will be aware that in September 2015 the Prime Minister announced a $100 million Women's Safety Package. The package was developed in conjunction with the expert advisory panel to
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">

                     , which included, of course, the inspirational Australian of the Year Rosie Batty. The package very much focuses on practical, immediate action items to keep women and children safe in their homes; improved training for front-line workers; trialling innovative and integrated service delivery in critical areas; and providing the best educational resources to parents, teachers and children to change the attitudes of people in terms of disrespecting women. As the Prime Minister has said, not all disrespect against women ends in violence against women, but all violence against women began with disrespect. As a parliament, this is something that we actively have to tackle.
