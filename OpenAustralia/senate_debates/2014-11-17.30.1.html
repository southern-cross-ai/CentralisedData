        , my question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. Can the minister confirm that sugar has been excluded from the recently concluded China-Australia Free Trade Agreement? When was the National Party informed of this?

         , we are hopeful that later today the President of China and the Prime Minister of Australia, and, indeed, their trade counterparts, will be signing off on an historic trade agreement. This is, without doubt, good news for all Australians and for the largest market in the world—namely, the people of China. Over all, it is a very, very good deal for both countries that will strengthen our capacity to grow jobs within this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         The President of China will be addressing a joint sitting of this parliament later on today and, in relation to the specifics of that free trade agreement, it seems only appropriate that no comment be made until such time as the matters are fully disclosed. But having said that, it stands to reason that with any free trade agreement negotiations a country will not get everything it wants. It would, therefore, be fair to say that Australia has not achieved everything that she would have liked; similarly, China has not necessarily achieved everything that China would have liked in these negotiations. But the question has to be asked—

           , my point of order is on direct relevance. Allowing for the minister's position about not releasing detail to the public, it would be useful to know whether the National Party has been advised of the detail of the agreement.

                    , I repeat my initial answer for the benefit of the honourable senator. I have indicated that I will not be going through chapter and verse of the free trade agreement until it is publicly announced. Having said that, as I indicated before: is everything that we wanted in the agreement? No, it is not. It is similar from the Chinese perspective.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Mr President, I indicate this is going to be an agreement, when announced, that will overwhelmingly be a good deal for Australian workers, for the Australian economy. Indeed, I indicate that these agreements are as a result of excellent work by Chinese and Australian bureaucrats and ministers and first ministers determining that it is within the interests of both the countries and their peoples.

Will the government now release the full text of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement—not a glossy pamphlet, not a one-page press release, not a photo opportunity, but the full text?

                      , Senator Wong would well know how these agreements are undertaken and how they are rolled out. Today an announcement was made that agreement had been reached. There will then be a signing ceremony later on today between the relevant trade ministers. After that, there will need to be a comprehensive agreement signed in the two languages—word for word, chapter for chapter—to ensure that everything is as both countries had agreed so as to ensure that the legal document reflects that which had actually been agreed. Will we release it beforehand? Of course not. Exactly like Senator Wong's Labor government did not do either. There is an established practice here. Senator Wong knows it, I know it, and she should be honest with the Australian people.

                            This morning the Prime Minister and President Xi announced the conclusion of negotiations for a tree trade agreement after more than 10 years. The signing of the landmark China-Australia free trade agreement today reflects a new high in the Australian-China relationship. Minister for Trade and Investment,

                            For Senator Wong's continual interjections, I am only making overarching comment, not talking about specific elements. Importantly, it positions Australia to benefit from China's growth and economic transformation over the coming decades. The China free trade agreement complements those that have already been entered into with

                              Our services sector, apart from the agriculture and resources sectors, will benefit. Senator Back, being the distinguished chair, as he is, of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, has a good understanding of the issues involved and therefore it is not surprising that he shows such a great degree of interest in this historic agreement.

                              -Australian free trade agreement will provide many Australian service industries an unmatched position in China's economy. This will create historic opportunities for Australians and Australian workers. Labor needs to decide whether they support trade or whether they remain slaves to their perverse protectionist philosophy. That is going to be a real challenge for Labor in the days ahead.
