        [by video link] I want to comment about the state and federal governments' lack of a plan. It's costing people enormously, sometimes costing people's livelihoods and lives. I checked with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Medical Officer
        </a>
        in Senate estimates and the secretary of the federal health department and they confirmed seven strategies for a plan. No. 1 is health and fitness. We have heard very little. No. 2 is personal behaviour and hygiene. We have heard very little apart from handwashing. No. 3 is proven treatments, cures and prophylactics like Ivermectin—not only have we heard little from the government, it has been suppressed and kept from the people. No. 4 is vaccines. I will come back to that in a minute. No. 5 is restrictions such as masks and social distancing. There is serious questioning now about the validity of these masks. No. 6 is testing, tracing and quarantining. There is very little done properly on quarantining. No. 7 is lockdowns. They have been used capriciously. These together show that the governments at the state level are relying on lockdowns which are capricious and ineffective—even the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" rel="nofollow">
         World Health Organization
        </a>
        says that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government relies on vaccines so let's look at vaccines. The senior health officials won't say that the vaccines are safe. They admit the dosage is not known. They admit the frequency of injections is not known. They admit the number of injections is not known. They admit that it won't stop us getting the virus. They admit it won't stop the spread. So why get it? In addition, we find that efficacy is plummeting dramatically. These things are basically useless after a short time. Now Pfizer itself is applying for the third booster shot. How many will there be? We don't know.

        , Nationals and Labor have been pushing this, and this is the first time in history that governments are injecting healthy people with something that can kill and actually is killing some people. Parliaments have abandoned the people. We need to get parliament back to serving people.
