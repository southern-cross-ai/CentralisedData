        . How can it be in Australia’s foreign policy interests for Mr Rudd to snub Japan in his 17-day worldwide tour? Why does Mr Rudd consider Romania and Belgium to be higher foreign policy priorities than Japan?

         I thank Senator Minchin for the question, but I am not sure he meant it all that seriously. Clearly the government values our relationship with Japan highly. They are a very significant trade partner and a very significant partner in our defence arrangements. They will continue to be central to our foreign policy into the future.

         The Prime Minister is travelling overseas during the parliamentary break, visiting a number of countries to pursue Australia’s national interest. On the one hand, critics from the other side want to suggest he is travelling too much by undertaking such a journey, and now we hear that somehow it is a snub to Japan because he is not going there. I do not think that is right at all. I think the Prime Minister has organised his travel on this occasion to pursue Australia’s national interests. He will pursue those very competently: as all Australians would be aware, the Prime Minister has a unparalleled background in foreign affairs, having served as opposition spokesman and previously as a member of Australia’s foreign service. There is no snub to Japan by him taking on this particular itinerary. He has made Australia’s commitment to the Japanese relationship very clear on a number of occasions and that will continue. I am sure at some stage on a future visit the Prime Minister will visit Japan.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Unlike the days when Mr Rudd’s constant trips to China were funded by various businessmen, including a gambling tycoon, Mr Rudd will have a government jet at his disposal during his four days in China. Why doesn’t Mr Rudd change his itinerary and make the 3½ hour flight from Beijing to Tokyo, even just for a day?

           I thank the senator for his question, I am sure the Prime Minister will take on board his travel tips. The reality is that on this occasion the Prime Minister is not visiting Japan. As I understand it, the Japanese embassy last night released a statement confirming our strong and growing relations. I also understand up to four of our ministers have already visited Japan—we have a very strong relationship with Japan. I understand that the Prime Minister has also accepted an invitation to attend the G-8 summit in July. These are questions of importance to Australia. The Prime Minister will continue to pursue Australia’s national interest, and his engagement with Japan will continue to be at a very senior and serious level. But on this occasion—on this trip—he is not visiting Japan.
