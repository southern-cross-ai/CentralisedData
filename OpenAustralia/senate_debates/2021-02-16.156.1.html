        When I first came into this place, in my first speech I spoke about the values that my parents instilled in me and how they would be my touchstone through my time representing the people of Victoria. One of the most important lessons they taught me was that there is enormous dignity in work. Work helps contribute to a person's sense of self, their purpose. It brings the opportunity to make a contribution to the community, the knowledge that you're doing your bit. Work is one of the things that bring stability, routine and inclusion. And, importantly, it brings an income. That income can support a family. It goes to the purchasing of local goods and services, supporting small businesses. It provides food, clothing, warmth and a roof over one's head. With work, you get to have a go, as our Prime Minister has reminded us in the past. When you have a go, you get a go, or so the Prime Minister says.

        The workers at the Opal Australian Paper mill in Maryvale, in my home state of Victoria, are trying to have a go. Despite the rhetoric of the Liberal and National parties, there's no go for them, because the Commonwealth is importing paper instead of buying quality, Australian made paper. In the three months from July till September last year the federal government only purchased around one-third of Australian made copy paper. This is nothing short of outrageous. At the height of the pandemic the federal government ditched paper made in Maryvale in favour of cheap imported paper. I thought we were all in this together, but clearly not. Clearly the workers at the mill couldn't even count on the federal government to be on their side.

        manufacturing division is calling on this government to commit to purchasing 100 per cent Australian made paper. A commitment like that will provide workers with stability and job security at a time when it is so badly needed. Australians in regional communities are already experiencing higher levels of instability and unemployment compared to Australians in major cities, so why would this government—and the National Party claims to be the party of regional Australia and to have regional Australians' best interests at heart—put the jobs of these workers at risk? It beggars belief.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regional Australians deserve a government that puts their interests first. They deserve a government who is on their side. Instead, they have a government that has taken no serious action to arrest the decline of manufacturing jobs and no serious action to support and invest in regional jobs. It has put the jobs of Maryvale paper mill workers at risk. My message to the coalition is: commit to procuring 100 per cent Australian made paper. Do more to support and invest in regional Australia.

        With the 1½ minutes I have left on the clock I want to turn to another matter. Recreational hunting in Victoria contributes $356 million to Victoria's economy, with almost three-quarters of this going directly into Victoria's regions. In my home state, recreational hunters take, on average, six hunting trips per year. They visit regional towns, patronise local establishments and purchase goods from local stores. In total they are estimated to support over 3½ thousand jobs, either directly or as a result of flow-on activity. These benefits are particularly felt in towns like Mansfield, Wangaratta and Traralgon, where recreational hunters and the economic benefits they offer are significant contributors to the local economy.
       </p>

        I know that, for some, duck hunting can be a sensitive issue. There are those on both sides of the divide who feel very passionately about the sport and its place in our community. Looking beyond these emotive arguments, the recent changes to the arrangements for the 2021 duck hunting season are quite disappointing. Whilst I'm certain that the decision has been made this year on the basis of the very best advice, I'm sure many country towns in Victoria would say it is regrettable.
