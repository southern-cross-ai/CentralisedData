        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Senator Cash. How does the Morrison government's JobMaker budget build on our record to support infrastructure delivery, create jobs and rebuild the economy following the economic impacts of COVID-19, particularly in regional Australia ?

         I thank Senator Askew for the question. The Morrison government understands that if you invest in infrastructure you are investing in the creation of jobs. That's why, through our budget 2020-21, we continue our record investment in job-creating, economy-boosting infrastructure. The recent budget also sees additional critical funding for transport infrastructure across all states and territories in Australia. The government's transport infrastructure program has now increased to a new record $110 billion over 10 years, from 2020-21. The new projects that we have announced in the budget are expected to support 30,000 direct and indirect jobs over the construction lives of the projects, at a time when we know Australia needs job-creating policies. This further investment builds on the significant investment that the Morrison government has already made in infrastructure, with projects already under construction supporting around 100,000 direct and indirect jobs over the life of the projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our infrastructure program is making a difference right across Australia. We now have had more than 60 projects starting construction in the last financial year, and more than 50 projects have been completed. Not only that, but our investment in our regions extends to every one of the 537 local government areas across the nation. In fact, the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program delivers a benefit to every council, no matter where it is. If you invest in infrastructure, as this government continues to do, you invest in jobs for Australians.

            Since the commencement of COVID-19, the government has committed to investing an extra $14 billion in new and accelerated infrastructure projects over the next four years, supporting the creation of around 40,000 jobs. This includes $1.5 billion being provided for shovel-ready projects and targeted road safety works right across Australia. We're working closely with state and territory governments to rebuild our economy and, of course, to support more jobs being created.
           </p>
           <p>
            The budget has also provided $2 billion for easy-to-deliver road safety treatments to be provided to state governments on a 'use it or lose it' basis. This will ensure that this funding is rolled out quickly and the benefits can flow to communities as soon as possible. Senator Askew, there is $150 million for the Midway Point Causeway and the

               The government is investing in the reopening of Australia. In fact, just this weekend, the government announced a $50 million partnership with the Tasmanian government to upgrade
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart_Airport" rel="nofollow">
                Hobart Airport
               </a>
               —which I know is such welcome news to our Tasmanian senators—so that it can take around 30,000 international travellers each week, beginning with three flights a week from
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                New Zealand
               </a>
               . It's these types of investments and deals that offer hope to businesses and workers in the airline and tourism industries that have, of course, been devastated by COVID-19. More planes in the sky, of course, means more jobs on the ground, in this case, for Tasmania and, of course, for our entire nation. The new arrangement that we've announced realises the vision set out in the Hobart City Deal. More jobs for Tasmanians is what we are now going to see.
