        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. Today, 11 November, marks
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        . Can the minister please advise the Senate on the importance of commemorating those who have served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations?

         I thank Senator Scarr for his question. As he has reminded us, today we mark
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Remembrance Day
         </a>
         , the day on which we acknowledge the more than 102,000 men and women who tragically died during or as a result of warlike service, non-warlike service and through peacekeeping operations. Originally known as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Armistice Day
         </a>
         , today marks the day those guns fell silent on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
          Western Front
         </a>
         during the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          First World War
         </a>
         on 11 November 1918.
        </p>
        <p>
         We had a population of around 4.5 million people at the time, and some 416,000 of those enlisted for service in the First World War. Tragically, over 60,000 of them would not return from the war. The allied nations first observed two minutes silence in honour of those who died and suffered during the war at 11.00 am on 11 November 1919, a hundred years ago today. From villages, towns and, of course, our state capitals, no corner of Australia was untouched by this war or those that have followed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The names of our war dead are listed on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_of_Honour" rel="nofollow">
          Roll of Honour

          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         . We have all seen them. We have all touched them. We're one of the few countries in the world that know the names of all our military personnel who died in war. The freedoms that we enjoy, the confidence we have that we can peacefully pursue our lives have not come without cost. We must remember those 102,000 always, not just to honour them but to fully appreciate what we have. Lest we forget.

           Australians in communities around the nation commemorate
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
            Remembrance Day
           </a>
           each year, from the young to the old. I, with other ministers and senators, the Leader of the Opposition and members of the House, the Minister for Defence, the Governor-General, ex-service organisations, current serving defence members, veterans and their families, and members of the community joined today to mark Remembrance Day and at the national cemetery at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
            Australian War Memorial
           </a>
           . We know that these Remembrance Day ceremonies occur across every state and territory capital, and in communities right across the country, where people gather at their local cenotaph—now 100 years old in many, many cases—and show their respect for those who have served and died in our defence forces. As we all paused for a moments silence today and displayed, as we do in the chamber this afternoon, our red poppies, I know that we all reflected on a time that military service has affected our own lives in one way or another and we honoured those who have given so much for us.

             services on bases and at public shrines and memorials around Australia, as well as around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have more than 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel serving on operations around the world who will also pause at that moment. They're deployed to operational theatres where they will be involved in commemorations either conducted by Australian contingents or, indeed, as part of coalition forces. They are immensely powerful experiences as coalition forces come together to join in acknowledgement of the Armistice and now of Remembrance Day. Our personnel are serving Australia's national interests around the world, whether it is across the sea, the land or the air domains. I know that all those in our chamber join me in acknowledging the men and women of the ADF on this day and thanking them for their service.
