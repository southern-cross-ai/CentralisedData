        I'd like to use this opportunity on behalf of all of the senators in this place, I'm sure, to acknowledge our appreciation—indeed, the appreciation of many, many, many Australians—of Professor Brendan Murphy's stewardship of our country's health response in what we all hope will be the final stages of a short pandemic. Professor Murphy is familiar to some senators who have spent their time on the community affairs committee. At the Senate estimates hearings, Professor Murphy sits from the very beginning of the community affairs Senate estimates hearings to the very, very end of them. Those people who are avid watchers of the estimates process—and I notice that Senator Siewert is here—know that Professor Murphy's contributions, when they're called upon, have always been tremendously insightful. They've been concise, which is a virtue at Senate estimates proceedings.

        It has been good that the whole country has been able to see Professor Brendan Murphy's immense talents and his health expertise, and I wanted to use this brief opportunity on behalf of all senators and on behalf of my
