         Act 2006
        </i>
        (OPGGS Act).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first measure is in response to a lack of functionality in section 54 of the OPGGS Act, which provides for apportionment of petroleum for revenue purposes between Commonwealth and State/Territory jurisdictions. Section 54 applies where a petroleum pool straddles a jurisdictional boundary, and the relevant Commonwealth and State titles on either side of the boundary are held by the same titleholder.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Petroleum in the seabed and subsoil tends to migrate towards an area of lower pressure, most commonly a producing well, so once production commences in either the Commonwealth or State/Territory jurisdiction, petroleum may move from one jurisdiction into another. Section 54 of the OPGGS Act is intended to ensure that the respective proportions of petroleum in each jurisdiction are determined before any such migration takes place.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Section 54 provides for the proportion of petroleum that is taken to be recovered on each side of the boundary to be determined by agreement between the titleholder, the Joint Authority and the responsible State Minister. The purpose of the apportionment is to provide certainty for the titleholder and government parties, into the future, as to the revenue regimes that will apply to the petroleum once it is recovered. In the case of a titleholder whose resource straddles a Commonwealth-State boundary, an up-front apportionment between jurisdictional tax and royalty regimes may be a key factor in the titleholder's commercial decision whether to commit to further investment in the project at that point in time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This was the case with the Browse Joint Venture's decision in 2015 to proceed to the next stage of investment in the Torosa gas field, a very large resource that has the potential to be significant for both the national and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        economies. The apportionment agreement that was negotiated prior to the making of that investment decision cannot come into force until the amendments now proposed are made to section 54 of the OPGGS Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, section 54 contemplates that an apportionment agreement relates to a single discrete pool that straddles a boundary. However, this assumes that there is a greater level of knowledge about the particular pool than is often available at the early stages of a project, which is when section 54 agreements are negotiated. As section 54 currently stands, if it subsequently became apparent that the area specified in the apportionment agreement in fact contained multiple petroleum pools, as may be the case when fuller technical information is obtained during the development of the resource, the apportionment agreement would fail. This would negate revenue certainty for both Commonwealth and State governments and commercial certainty for the titleholder. Yet the number of pools involved is not necessarily of any great significance. What matters is that an area of potential migration of petroleum across a boundary is the subject of an agreed apportionment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments in this Bill will therefore expand section 54 to ensure the ongoing validity of apportionment agreements if it becomes apparent that an agreement relates to an area which in fact contains multiple petroleum pools, rather than a single pool. The amendments also enable the making of a section 54 agreement about a specified part of the seabed that contains a common pool, but where connectivity between jurisdictions is not necessarily confined to the pool. This will ensure greater certainty and flexibility in relation to the development of an apportionment agreement, to support investment decisions. The amendment will apply equally to existing and future agreements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While these amendments have been prompted by the need to give legal efficacy to the Torosa agreement, they are not limited to the circumstances of that agreement. In the Torosa case, the apportionment followed a change in the maritime boundary between Commonwealth waters and Western Australian coastal and inshore waters. Similar boundary changes are in progress in other offshore areas. These also may result in blocks containing petroleum deposits becoming wholly or partly located in a different jurisdiction and an apportionment agreement may then be required.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure underscores this Government's ongoing commitment to investment in the Torosa gas field and the offshore petroleum sector more broadly, and to the facilitation of sufficient certainty in relation to apportionment agreements developed in the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's upstream petroleum sector is experiencing significant investment through several new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
         LNG
        </a>
        projects which have recently commenced production and further projects under construction which are due to come online over the next year or two.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These new projects combined represent around $200 billion in capital investment and will deliver significant economic and employment benefits over their multi-decade lives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They will see Australia's LNG exports more than triple from 25 million tonnes per annum in 2014-15 to around 75.2 mtpa in 2020-21 making Australia the world's largest LNG exporter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Beyond this, intensifying competition, project cost pressures and uncertain market conditions will have implications for further investment in new projects, like the proposed Browse project to which this Bill relates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        is working with industry on a range of reforms and other measures to ensure the ongoing competitiveness of Australia's oil and gas sector in an increasingly global market.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is critical that the appropriate legislative and regulatory frameworks are in place. This provides a level of certainty and removes any undue impediments to support the significant and long lived investments which characterise Australia's oil and gas sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This underlines the importance of this Bill to future investment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill also makes amendments to ensure there is a clear regulation-making power to support regulations that provide for the refund and remittal of environment plan levies in certain circumstances. The environment plan levy, imposed by the
        <i>
         Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003
        </i>
        (Levies Act), allows cost-recovery of environment-related regulatory functions undertaken by the national offshore petroleum regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA). To ensure effective cost-recovery, as well as fair and equitable application of the levy to titleholders, the
        <i>
         Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Regulations 2004
        </i>
        (Levies Regulations) provide for the refund and remittal of amounts of the levy in certain circumstances. NOPSEMA has been refunding and remitting amounts of environment plan levies on this basis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will insert a regulation-making power in the OPGGS Act to ensure there is a clear legal basis for the regulations to provide for the refund and remittal of environment plan levies. Retrospective commencement of the amendments will ensure the validity of refunds of amounts of environment plan levies previously given to titleholders in good faith and in accordance with the Levies Regulations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A further amendment made by this Bill will clarify that regulations may provide for remittal
        <i>
         and refund
        </i>
        of safety case levies imposed in relation to offshore petroleum facilities under the Levies Act. Currently, the relevant regulation-making power in the OPGGS Act refers only to
        <i>
         remittal
        </i>
        of safety case levies which can potentially be interpreted in a narrow way. This amendment will provide clarity and fully deliver on policy intent of the Australian Government that the offshore industry is not paying levies for regulatory services that it is not receiving.
       </p>

        I commend this Bill to the Chamber.

        ) Bill 2016, amends the
        <i>

        </i>
        to require foreign persons to register certain water entitlements and rights with the

         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill builds on the significant reforms the Government undertook last year to modernise and strengthen Australia's foreign investment framework. Those reforms represented the most significant overhaul of the
        <i>
         Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975
        </i>
        since its introduction 40 years ago.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a large, resource-rich country with relatively high demand for capital, Australia has relied on foreign investment to meet the shortfall of domestic savings against domestic investment needs for over two centuries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Foreign investment has enabled Australians to enjoy higher rates of economic growth, employment and a higher standard of living than could have been achieved from domestic savings alone.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Foreign investment has other benefits beyond injecting new capital. By bringing in new businesses with connections in different markets, it opens up additional export opportunities, boosting our overall export performance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While acknowledging the value and contribution of foreign investment to our national prosperity, it is important to strike a balance between maintaining an attractive and welcoming environment for foreign capital on the one hand, and maintaining community confidence in the foreign investment regime.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians must have confidence that there are clear rules that protect the national interest and that these rules are being enforced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why our Government has acted to strengthen the controls we place on foreign investment and are following through with improved enforcement to pursue those who break the rules.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of last year's reforms, the Government introduced the Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land Register. This was in response to increasing community concerns about the level of foreign investment in Australia's agricultural sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Agricultural Land Register and the first report, which I announced the release of last month, has for the first time given the Government and community a picture of the overall levels of foreign ownership of Australian agricultural land.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Similar to the Agricultural Land Register, the proposed Water Register will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive and reliable picture of the level of foreign investment in Australian water entitlements which meet the definition of registrable water entitlement or contractual water right.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill requires that from 1 July 2017, foreign persons who hold certain water entitlements and rights must notify the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        of their existing holdings and any subsequent acquisitions.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        will be able to establish a baseline picture of the level of foreign ownership as well as monitor changing trends over time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill requires the Commissioner of Taxation to administer the Register and provide a report for tabling in Parliament each year. The report on the Water Register will contain aggregated data about the water entitlements and rights that are foreign-owned by volume, state and territory, water source and country of investor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         The Commissioner
        </a>
        of Taxation is also required to publish aggregated statistical information derived from the Water Register on a website, to provide to the Australian people an understanding for the first time of the foreign interests in Australia's water entitlements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Regardless of the debate about what level of foreign ownership is ideal, the benefit of the Water Register will be to provide greater transparency and understanding of the actual levels of foreign ownership in water.
       </p>
