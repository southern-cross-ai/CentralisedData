Especially concerning is Schedule 5, which will remove a requirement for telcos to divulge the number of warrantless metadata requests they receive from law enforcement agencies. In order to ensure regulatory stability in the telecommunications industry and transparency of warrantless requests, the industry and consumers must be able to provide feedback on this bill in detail.

          do not agree that that bill should not be referred. We did refer it. We think that the Senate committee should be looking into that particular bill on provisions.
