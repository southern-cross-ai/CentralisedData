        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. I refer to yesterday's statement by the minister that he made no direction to the Indigenous Land Corporation to change its 2014-15 annual report, and had no conversations about delaying tabling until changes were made. I also refer to notes prepared for the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILC" rel="nofollow">
         ILC
        </a>
        chair, Mr Fry, ahead of an ILC board meeting which state that the minister said he would 'not consent to table the report while these inaccuracies stand.' Which statement is correct?

         Senator, I thank you for the question. I did not refuse to lodge the annual report under the circumstances that your question would indicate. Perhaps, if you are looking through the

           . I have spoken very clearly about this matter lately, in a statement on the record. I pointed you to the statement yesterday. At no time did I refuse. The documents that they are selectively quoting from were documents between

             to amend the report. I did ask the ILCâ€”I brought to their attentionâ€”about significant inaccuracies both by omission and statement in the report. That is what I did, and I have to say congratulations to the ILC for neither redacting any of the report but for adding information that very importantly put the context for people who receive and read such reports, to ensure that those inaccuracies were ameliorated by facts.
