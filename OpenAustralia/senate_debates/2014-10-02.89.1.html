        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. Can the minister confirm that in May this year officials from the minister's department and the

         Defence Materiel Organisation

                    , in terms of your answer to Senator Conroy, the question in fact did go to a member of the Prime Minister's staff. The answer that the schedule of meetings of officials is not something the minister recalls is not relevant to that aspect of the question. So I would invite you to consider that in light of your ruling.

                     Thank you, Senator Wong, but the question did ask whether the minister could confirm that a member of the Prime Minister's staff attended. The minister directly answered that question at the commencement of his answer by saying he did not have a schedule of all the visits to all countries. I thought he was quite conclusive with his direct response—and he is enhancing his answer. Minister, you have the call.
