       <p class="italic">
        (15)   What is the difference between the dumped National Funding Authority and the National Funding Pool, and can an outline of the parameters of each be provided, including:

       <p class="italic">
        (a)   management structures;

         Heads of Agreement
        </a>
        – National Health Reform document; if so, can details be provided.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (17)   Given that, in the health and ageing incoming brief to government, there is a reference to the Health Expenditure Working Group which has been established under the deputy heads of Treasury structure to quantify the costs of services agreed for transfer to government under the agreement (the first agreement) which will inform the amount of goods and services tax (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        ) revenue to be withheld in the Commonwealth forward estimates for dedication to health and hospitals:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)   did the department prepare any advice on the amount of GST required;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)   was it quantified; if so, what was the amount;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c)   was it the case that the amount of GST to be recovered under the 30 per cent clawback would not have been sufficient to cover the health and hospitals costs that were going to be needed over the forward estimates; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d)   if this is the case, was the dumping of the 30 per cent GST clawback a hollow decision.

          Western Australia
         </a>
         ) have signed the Heads of Agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Treasury provided advice to Government throughout the process in the lead up to the Heads of Agreement being signed as they would on any area of policy under consideration by Government.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The National Health Reform Agreement has now been signed by all states and territories as announced on 2 August 2011. The new agreement will provide better access to services, improved local accountability and transparency, greater responsiveness to local communities and a stronger financial basis for the health system into the future.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Additional funding under the new agreement will meet the costs of around 2.0 million more admitted patient episodes of care, 2.9 million more services in emergency departments, and 19 million more outpatient consultations based on current patterns of hospital expenditure, than the Commonwealth would have funded under the previous health care agreement.
