        I rise to speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (

         Bourke Street
        </a>
        Fund) Bill 2017. This bill will provide tax deductibility for donations to the Bourke Street Fund, which has been established in the wake of the terrible loss of six innocent lives on 20 January this year in Melbourne's CBD. Labor wholeheartedly supports the Commonwealth and Victorian governments in their efforts to support this fund and to ensure that all those affected by this tragedy receive every support they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fund itself will be overseen by an independent panel that will make decisions on how money donated to the fund should be spent, in consultation with the Victorian government, with a focus given to the families of the deceased. The bill will make the necessary changes to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to add the Bourke Street Fund to the list of deductible gift recipients. This will allow members of the public to claim donations to the fund as tax deductible, as is wholly appropriate. The specific detail of how that will function is available in the explanatory memorandum.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to also put on the public record my and the Labor Party's appreciation for the excellent work of our professional emergency services personnel in responding to this tragedy and also to note the courageous actions of many bystanders who were witnesses to the incident and offered their own help to the injured. Even when they are confronted with utterly senseless tragedy, it is always heartening to see the way in which Australians respond with characteristic empathy, generosity and resilience.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have no doubt many Australians were as inspired as I was by the stories of those bystanders who demonstrated selfless courage in rushing to the aid of injured strangers or drew solace upon seeing the overflowing floral tributes and letters that grew into an impromptu memorial around the steps of Melbourne's historic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPO" rel="nofollow">
         GPO
        </a>
        . And, of course, many Australians have shown tremendous generosity and donated to the fund, which has now raised in excess of $1 million. I thank those who have donated, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourke_Street_Mall" rel="nofollow">
          Bourke Street Mall
         </a>
         , in the heart of the city, was full of shoppers, workers on their lunchbreak, holiday-makers, parents and their children. In a few short minutes, one person managed to wreak havoc in the heart of the city, and lives were ruined forever. We wish these moments when lives are taken needlessly and many others are injured would never arise, but sadly, tragically, these events do occur. They disturb our sense of who we are, our sense of order and our sense of reality, and we ask ourselves: why?
        </p>
        <p>
         Our sympathies and love go out to the families and friends of those who passed away on that fateful day, and our strength goes out to those who were injured and are still fighting to recover. We acknowledge the bravery and resolve of those people who rushed to care for the dying and injured—ordinary civilians who showed courage in the face of adversity. We also thank the emergency services personnel who responded so bravely and so quickly in the line of duty.
        </p>
        <p>
         It happened just a short month ago. There was an immediate outpouring of emotion and grief in Melbourne and around the country. Now our job is to ensure that those families—those people involved in this tragedy who were so devastated by the event—are remembered and supported through our actions. I encourage all Australians who are able to do so to support the Bourke Street Fund, to open their hearts and to honour the memory of so many lives taken far too soon.

          </a>
          on 20 January this year. The despicable, unspeakable actions of one man that day claimed the lives of many Victorians and indeed injured many more. One man drove his car into crowds of pedestrians who were innocent bystanders to his acts of selfish, senseless aggression and violence. Many of the victims of this tragedy were on their lunch break, travelling between meetings, running errands, looking after their children or were children themselves.
         </p>
         <p>
          The appalling events of that day showed us all the very best of the Australian spirit.

          like taxidriver Lou Bougias rushed to the aid of the injured and spoke softly and reassuringly to those in shock and in pain until the emergency services could arrive. I commend the actions of Mr Bougias and all of those who helped that day. I thank them sincerely for their service to our state in a time of great darkness.

I stand tonight amongst all my Victorian colleagues in this chamber. We have different political views and come from different backgrounds but on this issue we are Victorians first and foremost. Like all Victorians, our hearts are broken but our resolve is strengthened. On behalf of senators Fifield, Ryan, Paterson and

           and had a minute's silence, surrounded by floral tributes, teddy bears and excruciatingly emotional cards and tributes to the fallen, and reflected on what had happened. I said on that day that at 1.39 pm on 20 January we saw Melbourne at its worst and in the minutes, hours and days after that we saw Melbourne at its best. I had my say earlier this week; I just wanted to say that it was a most ghastly time for Melbourne but, in the aftermath, it proved its strength, character and bravery and what a wonderful city it is.

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGR" rel="nofollow">
             DGR
            </a>
            s in division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 only in exceptional circumstances and where they do not fit within the general categories available under the tax law. Obtaining DGR status helps the listed entities attract public financial support for their activities as taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts of $2 or more to DGR entities.
           </p>
           <p>
            On 20 January 2017 a vicious and senseless attack took place in Bourke Street and elsewhere in the central business district of Melbourne. On 21 January 2017 the Victorian government announced the creation of a fund to provide financial support for the immediate families of the deceased and those injured as well as their immediate families. On 22 January the Prime Minister and the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services announced that the Australian government would work with the Victorian government to ensure that the fund received deductible gift recipient status and confirmed that the Commonwealth would contribute $100,000 to the fund. This is an appropriate way for the Commonwealth and this parliament to make a contribution and to support arrangements that will be of assistance to those injured and their immediate families. I commend the bill to the Senate.
