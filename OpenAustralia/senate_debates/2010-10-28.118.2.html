         It is a great mystery to me that I keep getting asked this question. We have completed stage 1 and we are in the process of starting up stage 2—something that has been mentioned in the chamber already. It is supported by the Tasmanian Liberal Party. But what I find comical is that Senator Barnett turned up at estimates and asked me a string of questions that had actually been answered many months before.

            , it distresses me to have to take a point of order on relevance. It is quite clear that the minister has not addressed the one issue raised by Senator Barnett. He only raised one issue: what is the cost. Talking about what Senator Barnett might or might not have done at estimates cannot be anywhere near the requirement of ‘directly relevant’ to the question of the cost of the rollout in Tasmania. Mr President, can I ask you to say to the minister that if he does not know the question he should sit down. He should not be allowed to prattle on about what opposition senators might have done at estimates or elsewhere. If he cannot answer the question, Mr President, you have an obligation to sit him down.

             , on the point of order: what the opposition have clearly not been doing is listening to the answer that Senator Conroy has been giving. Senator Conroy has been answering the question. The answer was, if you recall, that it was on the public record. That is clearly within the definition of being relevant to the question. The minister has been answering the question. Those opposite, if they do not read all the public editions, clearly read the
             <i>
              Australian
             </i>
             , as the first question provided. Nevertheless, the minister is being relevant to the question and there is no point of order.

              The standing orders allow two minutes for the answering of the question. The minister still has one minute 25 seconds remaining of that two minutes in which to answer the question. I cannot instruct the minister how to answer the question, although I am listening to the minister’s answer to the question to ensure that the question is addressed.

               As I was saying, Senator Barnett came and asked this very question at estimates. If he had bothered to read the
               <i>
                Hansard
               </i>
               from the previous estimates he would have found the entire contractual price: $37 million. As Mr Quigley has repeatedly said, for stage 1 at $137 million we came in under budget and on time. The reason I cannot answer that specifically is that there is a range of contracts that are currently about to be finalised. So when you say ‘to date’ do you mean at five o’clock today? I am not sure if it was signed yesterday. It may have actually been signed yesterday, Senator Brandis, but I am not managing it on a day-to-day basis. It is actually run by

                NBN
               </a>
               Co. So, if you want to know what stage 1 costs, it has already been put on the public record, and despite Senator Barnett not wanting to bother reading

                , a point of order on relevance: Senator Conroy has referred to a $37 million contract. I asked the question of the total cost to date of the rollout in Tasmania. The senator refused to answer this question at Senate estimates. He is refusing again today. He knows the answer and he is refusing to advise the Senate of the answer. I would ask you to ask him to answer the question or sit him down.

He was directly answering the question, indicating what stage 1 had cost and describing the contractual arrangements that would incur further costs. He could not have been more direct if he tried. So I would suggest Senator Barnett listen to the answer, given it is his third go at it.

Now that he has told the Senate that he cannot answer the question, what further he has to say can have no bearing on the question.

                            As I have indicated many times, subject to any commercial-in-confidence issues, we will be releasing a raft of information around the business plan. The reason that we are not going to waste Australian taxpayers’ money is that there are hundreds of cost-benefit analyses around Australia about the benefits of broadband to productivity. There are hundreds of them. All you have to do is stop being lazy and actually do it. But the premise of the cost-benefit argument is that you start off with a loss in the business case. As McKinsey made clear, it is financially viable and delivers affordable broadband. I am confident that the business case we are going to be receiving shortly will absolutely reinforce the business plan.
