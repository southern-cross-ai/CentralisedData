        My question is to Senator Abetz, the minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the threats made by the Minister for Education, Christopher 'the fixer' Pyne, on Sunday's

        program, when he said:

        … there are consequences … for not voting for this reform … The consequences are that potentially 1,700 researchers will lose their jobs …

        Was this threat authorised by the Prime Minister?

          Let us get one thing very clear: no threat was made. But what I would remind the honourable senator opposite of is his record and the Labor government's record. Indeed, Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt said on ABC radio:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I think this is an incredibly important reform. The current university funding model is … broken.
         </p>
         <p>
          He then went on to say:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This has been a bit of a train wreck for the last five years. In 2011, on the day I won the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize" rel="nofollow">
           Nobel Prize
          </a>
          , I brought this up as a challenge for the then Labor government that this was being done on a year-by-year basis, it was being done very poorly …
         </p>
         <p>
          So that of which Senator Carr speaks is a Labor legacy. When we got into government, we found that there was no money left for research and science, or NCRIS, I should say. The money ran out as of 30 June 2015. And, as my good friend the Minister for Finance assisted me with yesterday, on page 88, if I recall, of budget paper—

                 This was a lapsing program, using the words of Senator Wong herself just then. Just then, in a very ill-disciplined interjection, the leader of the Labor opposition in this place acknowledged it was a lapsing program. Which was the government that provided the money to ensure that it was no longer lapsing? It was the coalition, it was us, that restored the funding. So, please, Senator Carr, you who cut science and research in this country by hundreds of millions of dollars have no credibility in this area.

                   There was no humiliating backdown, so once again we can dismiss the Labor Party rhetoric. The only backdown that has occurred is in fact that the Labor Party that stopped funding for this program as of June 2015 now, all of a sudden, want to be the champions of it, after we restored the funding on page 88 of Budget Paper No. 2 in the last budget. We restored the funding. We provided the funding for a program that, out of the mouth of the leader of the opposition in this place today, we have heard, was a lapsing program—a program that the Labor Party thought was so unnecessary it could simply lapse. And today they come in here pretending to be the champions of NCRIS! Labor's actions in government speak so much louder than their words in opposition.

                    Can the minister confirm that this would result in $100,000 degrees for four-year courses in law, accounting, veterinary science and business administration—or has Mr Pyne fixed that too?

                     has dismissed that completely. But, in relation to university reform, can I refer to the Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt, who said:

                     I think this is an incredibly important reform. The current university funding model is, in my opinion, not very good. I would say it's close to being broken.

                               , on the point of order: the question was clearly about the false assertion about $100,000 degrees and then whether I agreed with somebody else's quote. So, in response to that, I am providing other quotes absolutely rejecting the assertion of Senator Carr. Clearly, that is in order.

                                In relation to the point of order, the minister did answer up-front that he rejected the assertion of the question. The minister—as all ministers have and continue to do—can elaborate on the answer. Minister, you have the call.
