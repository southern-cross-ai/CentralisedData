        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Yesterday the minister refused to say whether Mr Morrison agrees with coalition Senator Rennick's use of social media to undermine a TGA approved COVID vaccine which his own government is encouraging Australians to take up. Does Mr Morrison agree with Senator Rennick, yes or no? If not, what action will he take?

         I can't say that I've reviewed the specific comments of Senator Rennick, and I won't always take Senator Watt's word for it. What I can confirm, well and truly, is the government's very strong support for the vaccination rollout and very strong encouragement for all Australians to get vaccinated at the earliest opportunity and for all Australians to heed the advice in relation to the safety of vaccines and the efficacy of vaccines. The evidence shows very clearly that both vaccines available in Australia, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
          AstraZeneca
         </a>
         vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, reduce the rate of death when somebody acquires COVID-19 by some 92 per cent and 90 per cent respectively. That is the prime abiding reason and incentive for why anyone should get a vaccine. The number one incentive to get vaccinated in Australia: because it could save your life; because it could save the lives of family members.

             , obviously it was the fact I was talking about the real incentives to get a vaccine that perhaps drew the point of order from Senate Watt. The real incentives to get a vaccine being the fact it will save your life, save the lives of your family members and save the lives of your fellow Australians. You know what? Australians know that's the real reason to get a vaccine. They know that the real reason to get a vaccine is those lifesaving properties. It's why Australians participate overwhelmingly in childhood vaccination programs. It's why Australians are turning out in record numbers to participate in this vaccination program. It's why demand is very strong. That's why the Labor Party policy in relation to handing out $6 billion of cash is so horribly misplaced.

              A point of order on direct relevance. It is the case that there was reference to what Senator Rennick was doing, but the question goes to whether the Prime Minister agrees, and, if not, what action he will take.

               On the point of order: I believe Senator Birmingham addressed, at the commencement of the answer, his lack of intimate familiarity with the alleged comments referred to by Senator Watt in his question. I will say however that I made it clear I was reluctant to rule material about the vaccine rollout generally as being not directly relevant. I will say that I do not think that commenting on opposition policies meets the direct relevance test.

                . There was no direct quote in the question. As I said at the outset, I've not seen whatever the comments are that Senator Watt is referring to. But I'm very clear, the Prime Minister is very clear and the government is very clear in our continuous advocacy around the science, the efficacy and the encouragement of Australians to get vaccinated, as they are doing in record numbers.

                      Coalition senator Matt Canavan has criticised public health measures as, I quote: 'Doing much more damage to our love of liberty and our political system. That's the real threat to us now'. Does Mr Morrison agree with Mr Canavan? Importantly, what action will Mr Morrison take to ensure that his MPs back in the government's own public health message?

                       No. Indeed, in a debate only earlier today in this chamber, I responded to Senator Canavan, acknowledging that we did not agree in relation to some of those statements. We have been very clear in that regard. Senator Watt wants to ask about whether or not people agree. I would love to know whether they all agree with Mr Albanese's policy, because it didn't go to shadow cabinet, apparently. Apparently they didn't get a chance to say in their senior levels and their executive levels whether they agree. I can assure you that every member of the cabinet of this government agrees with our approach.

That high and growing demand is something that we will continue to encourage. Australians are responding to that message, and we—
