        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Within days of the Prime Minister and Minister Birmingham announcing the so-called Gonski 2.0 package, Deputy Prime Minister Joyce indicated there would be tweaking, and the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, Mr Sukkar, suggested the government would have to modify its plans to ensure schools were satisfied. What changes does the government intend to make to save its unravelling education package, announced only a short week ago?

         Senator Kitching, honestly! Senator Birmingham announced last week the most fundamental reform of school funding in Australia that we have seen in this nation for many decades. It is a comprehensive package. It restores what your government failed ever to comply with, and that is the principles of the 2011 Gonski report, as Mr David Gonski himself said last week and as Senator Birmingham quoted him in his answer to an earlier question. Senator Kitching, as I said to your colleague Senator Sterle, what is the Labor Party's problem with the principle of equity in funding?

           The point is on direct relevance. One question: what changes does the government intend to make to save its unravelling education package announced only week ago? We have inconsistent quotes from members of the cabinet as to whether or not the package is up for changes. I invite the

             , I thought I had dealt with that in my opening words. But the package, as announced by Senator Birmingham, is the package. It is a complete and comprehensive package, and we are not proposing to make changes to the package. The package is a complete and self-sufficient package, and it has the support of every member of the government. I said a moment ago that this package has been endorsed by Mr Gonski, and I was, by interjection, contradicted by your colleague Senator Jacinta Collins. Let me read you what Mr Gonski had to say at his media conference last week:

                find it very hard to swallow, but the fact is that you commissioned Mr David Gonski, a most highly respected Australian, to conduct a review. You traded upon his name and reputation, and in his name and reputation you then ushered forth a series of policies that bore little or no resemblance to the principles of his report. You left a hodgepodge of 27 inconsistent special funding deals. I cannot tell you how pleased and relieved Mr Gonski was, as he was last week, when he was able to stand shoulder to shoulder with a Prime Minister and an education minister who respected the integrity and the principles of his report.

                   Senator Kitching, I am not going to be a commentator on what Mr Abbott may have to say from time to time. He is perfectly entitled to his view. Senator Kitching, the fact is that, when Senator Birmingham made the announcement he made last week, that was a historic day in the history of Australian education, because, as a result of that announcement, the principles that Mr Gonski espoused have been reclaimed. I know you find it difficult to deal with, but they have been reclaimed by the Turnbull government and by a much better education minister than any education minister the Labor Party, during the Gillard and Rudd governments, ever put into the portfolio. And, as a result, there will be needs-based funding.
