         I thank Senator Sterle for his question. I know that he understands just how important trade is to the great state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         The Albanese Labor government has committed to building strong economic ties with our trading partners to deliver practical outcomes for Australia's exporters and to create more well-paying jobs for Australians. That's why earlier this month the Prime Minister and I travelled to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" rel="nofollow">
          San Francisco
         </a>
         to attend
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
          APEC
         </a>
         meetings. APEC has long been at the forefront of pushing the trade liberalisation agenda. This year's APEC priorities included advancing the digital trade agenda; ensuring inclusivity and sustainability; and mainstream intertrade and investment policies. While in San Francisco and Shanghai, I met with the Chinese Minister of Commerce, Wang Wentao. Engagement with China has proven effective—just ask any Australian exporter of coal, cotton, copper, concentrates, timber, logs, oats, hay, barley or stone fruits. Think of all the jobs created as a result of the considered approach the Albanese government has taken to restoring market access for these products.
        </p>
        <p>
         A ministerial meeting also took place in San Francisco to advance the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework negotiations. IPEF, as it's known, is designed to promote workers' rights; to lift and align trading standards; to build supply chain resilience; and to promote clean energy investment so that trade flows more freely and more fairly in the Indo-Pacific region—our region. More trade, not less, means more well-paying jobs, more national income and, of course, more opportunities for businesses and for workers.

            agenda and the IPEF outcomes were complementary. Both help to build a more resilient and interconnected region, promote an innovative environment for the sustainable future and strengthen an equitable and inclusive future for all. In

            </a>
            I was pleased to sign Australia up to the new IPEF supply chain agreement. This is a practical agreement that will help fix future supply chain crises fast, easing cost pressures on households by getting more product into the market. Prime Minister Albanese also announced the creation of an IPEF critical minerals dialogue, which will enhance Australia's role as a renewable energy superpower. Outcomes such as these will strengthen Australia's ties with our trading partners.

               is the gateway to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley" rel="nofollow">

               , and Silicon Valley is the home of global tech innovation, including artificial intelligence. I was pleased to meet with representatives from Google, Salesforce and innovative Australian startups using satellite technology to improve winegrowing around the world. The Albanese government is actively supporting Australian innovation as well as attracting foreign investment in technology to create more well-paying jobs at home. For example, Microsoft recently announced a $5 billion investment in Australia as well as new artificial intelligence partnerships with the Digital Transformation Agency. This investment helps to support the government's commitment of creating 1.2 million tech related jobs by 2030.
