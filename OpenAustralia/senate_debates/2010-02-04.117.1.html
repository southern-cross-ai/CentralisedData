        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Minister, will the impact of the government’s

         I thank the senator for this question. The government has supplied the information on the modelling of the impact on households and on prices. The government’s commitment was that it would structure the compensation package to meet those costs. That modelling was released when we debated this legislation twice in this parliament—I do not quite understand how it is that the opposition now wants to debate it again before the bill actually comes back to the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I say, the opposition have had two chances to debate the bill, to seek to amend it if they thought it needed improving and to pass the bill, but now it seems they are more interested in discussing it, having already defeated it twice. The parliament will get the chance to vote on this legislation again and I hope the interest they are now showing in our legislation will be represented in their approach to it when it comes back. The package of compensation was announced by the government, it was made clear that it was focused on—

          , I rise on a point of order on relevance. Sessional orders require that the minister be directly relevant to the question. There was no mention of compensation in the question, it was simply whether the

           ETS
          </a>
          on prices would be a one-off event or would it vary with changes to the carbon price. The answer is either that, yes, it is a one-off event, or it will vary—just tell us. The compensation is nowhere near the issue.

                In announcing the compensation package, the government committed to an annual review of its household assistance package, so the compensation is ongoing. The government committed to an annual review of its household assistance package to make sure that it was meeting the needs outlined by the government in terms of the compensation targets.

                       I am trying to assist the senator by giving him the answer. As I said, the government committed to an ongoing compensation package and the figures were calculated according to the Treasury analysis to provide that compensation. The government has already committed to the annual review of its household assistance package which I understand from Senator Wong will be adjusted in the budget context. So there is ongoing compensation that will be adjusted as part of an annual review. The key point is this: the Rudd Labor government will compensate families and put the costs on polluters; the Liberal Party will not put a cap on pollution and will make taxpayers carry the cost.

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. Minister, if, according to the Prime Minister, there is only a one-off adjustment to the price, why is an annual review needed? If the Prime Minister cannot understand his own scheme then how can he expect the Australian public to understand it, let alone support it?

                          I can only repeat to the senator that this whole package was released late last year, that the Treasury analysis that supported it was presented and that we have provided for compensation to Australian families and pensioners. We also committed to an annual review of the household assistance package so it would be adjusted in the budget context. That is how the compensation scheme is designed to work. We have had two attempts to get this legislation passed by this parliament and you have refused to support it. Quite frankly, a debate about the detail could have occurred then, but the key point is this: under the government’s scheme we seriously tackle climate change, we compensate Australian families and we make the polluters pay. Mr Abbott’s scheme does not cap pollution and does not compensate families; it makes taxpayers carry the burden.
