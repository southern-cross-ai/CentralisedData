        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         At the last election, the Government promised to take a hands-on approach to the commemoration of the Centenary of Anzac. We said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <i>
          The Centenary of Anzac will be a period of national reflection, remembrance and commemoration for the service and sacrifice of so many Australians in defence of our way of life, our values and our freedoms.

          </a>
          will ensure that communities right across Australia have every opportunity to commemorate the deeds of local people in the service of their nation.
         </i>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We have delivered this commitment.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Since coming to office, this Government has delivered the nation's most significant national commemorative event in history. The 100th anniversary of the landing of Australian and New Zealand forces at Gallipoli was commemorated on 25 April 2015 in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          Australia and New Zealand
         </a>
         , as well as locations around the world, including the place of the landing at Gallipoli in Turkey.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Australians actively participated in the commemoration of this watershed moment in our nation's history. In the biggest cities and the smallest towns and farming communities, Australians gathered in extraordinary numbers to pay their respects to all those men and women who have served our nation in all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations over more than a century of service.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Why commemorate a Centenary of Anzac and a century of service
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Commemoration is a vitally important component of the support we provide returned men and women.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Providing financial and health care assistance through our world-leading repatriation system is a fundamental way of acknowledging service and sacrifice. Similarly, commemorating veterans' service is a nation's obligation to those who have served.. As a society we owe it to veterans, and their families, to recognise their service and to provide validation and acknowledgment that their service and sacrifice was worthwhile and is respected.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Centenary of Anzac is not just about commemorating those who fought in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          First World War
         </a>
         . The Anzac Centenary program is about a century of service: it commemorates and recognises the service of all those who have served in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         over the last one hundred years.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is a mistake to think that commemoration is somehow not important in validating the service of veterans. It is a mistake to think that the Anzac Centenary program is not recognising the service of contemporary veterans either. As I have said previously, it is most important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, such as the appalling way our Vietnam veterans were treated. The Centenary of Anzac is about commemorating service in all theatres in which Australians have served in war, conflict or peacekeeping operations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The taxpayer support for the Centenary of Anzac, spread over more than 10 years, is consistent with the community's desire to honour those who have served our nation. Spending is measured – it is not excessive. Annually, government spending on commemoration represents less than 0.1 per cent of the entire $12 billion Department of Veterans' Affairs' budget for pensions, compensation and health care treatment for veterans and their families.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Within Australia, funding for the Centenary of Anzac has included up to $125,000 per Federal electorate for community-based commemoration through the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. It funded the curtain raiser for the Anzac Centenary - the Albany Convoy Commemorative Event and included funding three quarters of the National Anzac Centre in Albany.

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Our support for the Centenary of Anzac is in not at the expense of our ongoing support for veterans and their families. For example,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
          DVA
         </a>
         's annual Budget of around $12 billion includes more than $6 billion in financial assistance to veterans, and more than $5 billion in health treatment costs. Further, every year we spend at least $179 million on dedicated mental health treatment and support for veterans and their families. This funding is demand driven and is not capped.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Since the last election, the Government has issued two Ministerial Statements about the Centenary of Anzac. This statement, the third, looks back at events of Anzac Day 2015, but also forward to the remainder of the commemorative programme until the 100th anniversary of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_Day" rel="nofollow">

        <p class="italic">
         The Centenary of Anzac captured the interest and imagination of communities right across Australia. Consistent with the Government's pre-election commitment, community-based commemoration was at the heart of the Centenary of Anzac commemorations.

         's Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program provided up to $125,000 per Federal electorate to support community-based commemoration. Across 150 electorates almost 1,800 individual projects sought funding. Applications from local groups have shown a high level of community engagement, innovation and educative value.

It is a rare thing indeed for two nations, once enemies, to be such firm friends. It is even rarer for the nation who was once our foe to welcome us so warmly to the place where the landing took place in 1915.

         Consistent with the Government's pre-election commitment, the Budget also extends Deductible Gift Recipient status to the Boer War Memorial Project and the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project until 31 December 2017. I encourage both of these organisations to use this extension to actively seek financial support for the establishment of their memorials. This extension comes at a cost of $1.4 million to the Commonwealth, and is on top of $200,000 in seed funding provided to each organisation.

         Australian involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has been complex and long-running, and is of sufficient magnitude and complexity to warrant an official history.

         The Centenary of Anzac is far from over. As the Prime Minister has said: "Gallipoli was a splendid failure; the Western Front was a terrible success and we should recall our victories as much as our defeats." Our focus will soon shift to the commemoration of these events.

           I rise to take note of the ministerial statement on the Centenary of Anzac and the Anzac celebrations at Anzac Cove this year. Last night I was very fortunate to be able to share with this place my story and my family's story of our pilgrimage to Gallipoli as four of the very lucky ballot holders to go and join in the ceremonies there. I shared a little bit about my own family journey and the family story of our experience in learning more about my grandfather, who never talked about war and never valued any of his mementos or anything that reminded him of his four years in war.
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the most wonderful things that I think has happened very organically now is that, through the Centenary of Anzac activities, we are capturing more and more of the individual stories of the men and women who served in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
            World War I
           </a>
           . While the stories of many of these servicemen in particular are now lost to time, save a family's note to them on their gravestone or their service records, wonderfully, what I have experienced myself now is that, through historians and the increasing work of families, people are going back and trying to recover and preserve as much of the family history of their World War I veteran relatives as they possibly can. How that is now evolving is truly a wonderful thing.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, before I went to Gallipoli, I attended several
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
            RSL
           </a>
           Anzac Day ceremonies. One of the things that was very clear is that, even at the local community level, not just through RSLs but through schools and other community groups, people are now looking very carefully and closely at who served in their local community. They are capturing the stories of very ordinary Australians who did extraordinary things in the service of their country in World War I.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, in the RSL in my local area of Kalamunda in Perth I found the story of Sister Agnes Tait, who was from Carmel in the hills. She was the only woman on the Kalamunda and districts RSL honour roll. Sister Tait, against her parents' wishes, trained as a nurse at the Perth public hospital and joined the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Army
           </a>
           Nursing Service on 23 August 1915. Sister Tait served in Egypt, at a casualty clearing station in France and at base hospitals across Europe and England. She spent years tending to the dead, dying and critically injured. She spent the last two years of the war on a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
            Red Cross
           </a>
           hospital ship, comforting those who were finally returning home. Like everybody else, she eventually returned home—in this case, to Kalamunda—where she remained for the rest of her life, serving the community as a nurse. Sister Tait is just one of the thousands of examples of local community members who are being remembered.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was also very fortunate to launch in Fremantle on behalf of the Minister for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
            Veterans Affairs
           </a>
           a wonderful book called
           <i>

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
             Great War
            </a>
           </i>
           . This was an astonishing achievement by Mr Pittaway and the Army historical society. They discovered that over 3,000 young men left the Fremantle community for the Great War and nearly a third of them never returned home. It is a wonderful book that captures what it was like at the time in Fremantle. The historians spent many years working with families, going through their records and pulling out family oral histories. It is a most remarkable record of the Fremantle community.

           , the member for Fremantle, was also at the launch. Interestingly, by sharing my story of my grandfather and her sharing her story of her great-uncle, we realised that the two of them served together at Gallipoli. In fact, they were both in the 3rd
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Ambulance" rel="nofollow">
            Field Ambulance
           </a>
           , my grandfather leaving from Albany and her great-uncle leaving from Fremantle. They must have known each other and served together, tending the wounded and the dying at Gallipoli. You just never know quite where these linkages are going to come from.
          </p>
          <p>
           My story that I shared last night and the thousands of other stories that are now coming to light not only help families preserve the memory of their family members, sometimes three generations ago now, but also make sure that these men and women are remembered. When we come together as a nation to commemorate all those who have served—not just those in World War I but in World War
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
            II
           </a>
           , all the other conflicts we have been involved in and those we are involved in today—it gives families the understanding and ability to make sure that they capture the stories when they can. That is one of the many wonderful things that the Centenary of Anzac program is delivering to this nation.

            I rise to speak on the ministerial statement on the Centenary of Anzac and to reiterate the sentiments of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and, hopefully, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, when he is able to get back from the War Memorial.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Centenary of the Anzac landings on Gallipoli have given all Australians the opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices that our service men and women have made for our country. While the centenary recognises time passed since that conflict, the commemoration of Anzac has a much broader meaning. It is important that we as Australians remember that Anzac Day is a commemoration and a time of reflection. It is a time not only to reflect on the actions of the Anzacs 100 years ago but also to recognise the sacrifices and commitment of our men and women who are currently serving overseas far from home and their families. While the Anzac legend is firmly rooted in the shores of Gallipoli, the values that the Anzacs represent have been practised by Australian service men and women ever since.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anzac Day is our opportunity to recognise and thank all of those who have given themselves to protect our country. Many of my colleagues have spoken about the Anzac Centenary in past weeks. I share their admiration for those who have served, but I take this opportunity to make particular mention of the men and women who are currently serving overseas and the families who support them. There are approximately 2,750 Australians serving in 14 different operations globally. They are working in places like Iraq, Sudan and across the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
             Middle East
            </a>
            as well as closer to home. These people exemplify the best qualities of our military and community. They operate under challenging circumstances with dignity, compassion and professionalism. As they uphold the honourable values that we associate with the Anzac spirit, their families at home bear the heavy burden of an absent loved one. Service to our country puts immense distance between parents and children, husbands and wives, and brothers and sisters. We as a community have an obligation to those service families. While our loved ones are representing our country far from home, we must ensure that these families are appropriately supported. Provision of housing, health care, education and other essential services helps ease the burden of having a loved one away while on service related duties. Furthermore, this support must extend to our veterans once their service is complete. The spirit of Anzac demands that we stand by our people. Their service has earned are respect and our gratitude.
           </p>
           <p>
            On behalf of this side of the chamber I sincerely thank all of the courageous people who have served our country throughout its history. The Anzac commemoration has been an opportunity for all Australians to thank you for your service. I congratulate the minister for overseeing an excellent program and an excellent centenary. It is a credit to him.

             I thank Senator Conroy for his very generous comments. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Australians actively participated in the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings on Anzac Day this year. In the biggest cities and the smallest towns and farming communities, Australians gathered in extraordinary numbers to pay their respects to all those men and women who have served our nation in all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations over more than a century of service.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since the last election, the government has issued two ministerial statements about the Centenary of Anzac. This statement, the third, looks back at the events of Anzac Day 2015 but also forward to the remainder of the commemorative program until the 100th anniversary of

             Community enthusiasm for Anzac Day is arguably at its highest level in a generation. Crowds at dawn services in Australia continued to increase. There were huge crowds in capital cities, including here in Canberra. Major regional dawn services, such as at Torquay in Victoria, Albany in

             , for their work. I know that many RSL subbranches were responsible for working with local government, police and other services to coordinate community commemorative events involving large numbers of Australians. To the RSL, in particular, and other ex-service and service organisations who took on this responsibility I say a most sincere thankyou on behalf of the Australian government.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also wish to place on the record how proud I am of the staff from my department and across the government who worked tirelessly to bring events in Gallipoli together. The people responsible are part of a small, dedicated and highly professional team of staff who bring together these services on Anzac Day. I echo the words of the Prime Minister when he said their planning was 'meticulous'. I add to this by saying, 'Thank you—you have done your nation proud.'

             The Gallipoli dawn service was attended by 10,043 people at the Anzac Commemorative Site in Turkey on Anzac Day.

             Funding in this year's budget will deliver the government's commitment to honour not just events on the Western Front and Be'er Sheva, but key anniversaries throughout the century of service.

             . Attendance at this ceremony will not be balloted. The attack at Lone Pine began in the early evening of 6 August 1915 and it is appropriate that, 100 years on, we mark this event at this time.

             The August Offensive, which this ceremony will commemorate, was the last great push by the Allies against Turkish forces. Four days of intense fighting cost more than 2,000 Australians killed or wounded. This ceremony will particularly honour them. The service also provides those Australians who were unable to attend Gallipoli on Anzac Day with the chance to visit and participate in a commemorative event.
