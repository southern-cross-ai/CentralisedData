        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Canavan. I refer to the opinion piece of the minister's close colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells in
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">
          The Sydney Morning Herald
         </a>
        </i>
        today titled 'Good work damaged by minister on L plates, but here's how to help our neighbours'. Senator Fierravanti-Wells writes that our relationship with the Pacific was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        â€¦ recently damaged by an Environment Minister on "L-plates" through the unfortunate incident with former President Tong of Kiribati.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the minister agree with this assessment of her performance by the former Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development" rel="nofollow">
         International Development

        and the Pacific? And, if the environment minister is still on her L-plates, who is supervising?

         I thank Senator Kitching for her question. No, I disagree with my colleague's assessment on that matter. We have a very strong relationship with our Pacific neighbours. Indeed, it's a relationship that this government is continuing to invest in. In the past week, we have made very significant announcements and investments in regard to strengthening that relationship with our Pacific neighbours, including by establishing funds for infrastructure in Pacific regions. This week, of course, the Prime Minister will be visiting
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         to meet with other leaders in

         </a>
         and also announcing further important investments in Papua New Guinea. We take our relationship with the Pacific extremely seriously, and Minister Price is part of a government that is progressing all of those relationships in a detailed, considered and substantive way. We will continue to work with our Pacific neighbours to make sure we strengthen their economies, along with the relationships and contributions they make to our country. I look forward to continuing to work with Minister Price on those matters.

            As Senator Kitching has outlined, Minister Price has answered questions on this matter in the other place. I know that, like me and other members of this government, she supports and continues to work towards better relationships with our Pacific neighbours. As I outlined in answer to the earlier question, just in the past week the government has announced further funding to strengthen that relationship with our Pacific neighbours, including a $2 billion infrastructure financing facility, which the Prime Minister says will focus on energy, water and transport needs for our Pacific neighbours. We're also, of course, committed to helping our Pacific neighbours tackle challenges around climate change, and we've supported programs in that area as well. We will continue to work to strengthen our relationship with our Pacific neighbours, as we have done the whole time we've been in government.
