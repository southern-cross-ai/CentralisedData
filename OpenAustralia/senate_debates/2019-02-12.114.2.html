          I know all Queensland senators and, indeed, I suspect, all senators will agree with this motion. I just mention that it's times of calamities like what happened unexpectedly and unusually in Townsville last week that bring out the best in people. The way neighbours got in to help each other and people they didn't even know—I particularly want to again mention the huge work the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Army
          </a>
          did. Many of its members themselves had been affected by the floods, but they were out helping others. There are all sorts of people that are mentioned in the motion and there were more besides.
         </p>
         <p>
          My motion deals particularly with Townsville, but I also do acknowledge, as we did in question time, that there is an unfolding drama and tragedy happening in north-west Queensland as the unprecedented rain out there also takes effect.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question agreed to.
