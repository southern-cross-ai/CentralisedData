         I thank Senator Brockman for his question on defence industry. I acknowledge his commitment to defence industry in our home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         —a true champion. There is no senator or minister prouder than I am today of this government's record on supporting defence. Over the last six years the Liberal-National government has worked to recover and rebuild defence following six years of Labor failure and utter neglect. On this side of the chamber we made a commitment to increase defence spending to two per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         . We're sticking to it and we are on track to deliver that in the 2020-21 financial year. In 2016 the Liberal-National government released the
         <i>
          2016 Defence white paper
         </i>
         and committed to invest over $200 billion into defence capability. Through that we are already supporting over 30,000 jobs right here in Australia. There are now over 3½ thousand
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p>
         All this is possible because of our economic plan to build a stronger economy and a more secure future for all Australians.

            Thank you very much, Senator Brockman. Our government is securing Australia's future by creating a sovereign defence industry to deliver on vital capability for the ADF. That will keep Australians safe and create new, multigenerational jobs for Australians. We are maximising the involvement of Australian defence industry
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
             SME
            </a>
            s to deliver this capability. As I've just said, over 3½ thousand SMEs are now providing support to the ADF through the supply chain. We are maximising their involvement. Just last week I visited Joe and Joel Nevin from Blacktree Technology's brand new facility in Belmont,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Western Australia

            , and announced our government's defence policy for industry participation. Their business is an outstanding example of how a competitive, local SME in WA and right across this nation can thrive in defence industry. Blacktree Technology's innovation and communication technologies are—

               I thank Senator Brockman for his question and I can certainly see, right across this chamber, the greatest threat we have to our defence capability in Australia. You only have to look at their past record. I know they don't want to talk about this, because what was their record? First of all, how many new ships or vessels did those opposite commission in six years of government? Absolutely zero. Not only that; when Labor are at the helm, they pose a real threat to our defence industry and capability. Guess how many defence projects those opposite cancelled when they were in government.
