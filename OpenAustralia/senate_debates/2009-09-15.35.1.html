          I was asking what action the joint venture has taken to maximise these opportunities. Also, what support has the Commonwealth provided to facilitate the joint venture’s engagement with local suppliers? How does this relate to the government’s wider agenda to increase Australian industry participation in major projects?

               The project will create some 3½ thousand ongoing direct and indirect jobs throughout its life. It will deliver around $300 billion in export earnings over the next 20 years. It will generate $40 billion in government revenue, which can be used to fund schools, hospitals, roads and other infrastructure for decades to come. It is a pity the opposition is not concerned about these matters. Critically, it will also use $33 billion worth of locally purchased goods and services. Our aim is to get more people buying Australian at home and abroad.

               joint venture development is an Australian Industry Participation Plan project, which will see that in early stages of the project there will be opportunities given for local firms to establish their competitive positions. It is working with the Industry Capability Network to identify Australian suppliers for the project, and the Commonwealth has granted the network $159,000 to support this work. The Gorgon project is also advertising upcoming program procurement contract opportunities on its website.

                , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister please inform the Senate on further measures to support Australian industry participation through reform of the Enhanced Projects By-Law Scheme and the Tariff Concession System, as recently outlined in the Australian Government Procurement Statement released in July? What is the purpose of these programs and why is reform necessary? How will these reforms foreshadowed by the government increase transparency and accountability? What benefits can be expected to flow from the reform process, not only for industry but also for project proponents and consumers?

                 and I started consultations on the proposed changes to both these import duty relief programs. These changes will ensure that clearer Australian industry participation plans are developed upfront when projects are being designed. They will ensure that people only apply for import duty concessions after making a genuine, and I emphasise the word ‘genuine’, attempt to establish that no Australian producer can supply suitable goods. We want to ensure that these programs give Australian industry a fair go and reduce costs for project proponents, for businesses and for consumers.

                       , is if you would call Senator Cormann to order. His behaviour is, I think, unparliamentary. I have always been in favour of robust debate in this chamber but I think making signals to ministers when they are in the middle of their answering questions or a question is disorderly and I ask you to bring Senator Cormann to order.
