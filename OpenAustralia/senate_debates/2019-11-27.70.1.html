        This is not my last question. My question is for the Minister for Youth and Sport, Senator Colbeck. The federal government peak sports body, Sport Australia, is proposing that directors of Australia's national sporting federations have a maximum term of eight years. Can the minister state if the government supports that proposal and, if so, explain why the government feels it necessary to mandate term limits on sporting bodies but not in other areas of public interest like politics and corporate boards?

         Thank you for the question and some advice as to the general topic of the question. Ten years is currently regarded as the general acceptable minimum period for board membership under the principles dictated by Sport Australia; however, it is up to individual sports to determine if a shorter period would be more appropriate. Sport Australia's mandatory governance principles, first released in March 2013, then updated in June 2015 and currently online, are that national sporting organisations should have a staggered rotation system for board members, with a maximum term in office of 10 years. There are no constitutional changes proposed by Sport Australia for eight years at this point in time. I do note, however, that, since April 2019, Sport Australia has been leading a process to review and co-create evolved governance principles. The process has included consultation with state offices of sport, all state sport federations, national sporting organisations,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSO" rel="nofollow">
          SSO
         </a>
         s and academic experts. The term of board members is one of the many principles being considered under this work.

           I thank the minister. In response to the chairman of Sport Australia's comments that an eight-year term limit was appropriate, former Sport Australia board member
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Masters" rel="nofollow">
            Roy Masters
           </a>
           has raised concerns that these proposed limits would impact the ability of Australian sporting officials to get on international sporting federation boards, thereby reducing the influence of Australian officials on the world stage. Does the minister agree with this assessment and, if not, why not?

            I support the words of Mr Masters in his desire that Australians have the opportunity to represent sports on global forums, such as Mr Coates currently does on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee" rel="nofollow">
             International Olympic Committee
            </a>
            . I think it is important that Australia is involved and representative on these international boards, so we should have in place processes in Australia where the experience required to make those representations is appropriately gained through involvement in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSO" rel="nofollow">
             NSO
            </a>
            s and other organisations such as the

             Australian Olympic Committee
            </a>
            . I support that concept, because I think it's really important. I might point out though that it is not a requirement for Australians to hold board positions or chairmanship positions in NSOs at an Australian level to represent Australiaâ€”

             <p>
              I'm interested in hearing the minister conclude that answer, but I also add that Masters reports that Australia now has its lowest representation on international sports boards, with 10 representatives across 40 international federations. Under the proposed reforms, all but four would be subject to mandatory standdown from these roles. Is this correct? If so, how can this be good for Australia's sporting system?

               As I indicated previously in response to the first supplementary question, there is no requirement being considered at the moment by Sport Australia, as I'm advised by Sport Australia, for an eight-year term. As I was saying in the conclusion of my last response, there is no requirement for those representing Australia or participating in international boards to hold an
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSO" rel="nofollow">
                NSO
               </a>
               position here in Australia, so I'm not sure that the circumstance that has been described by Senator Bernardi with respect to those who currently hold those positions would apply. I know that, for example,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Allen" rel="nofollow">
                Matt Allen
               </a>
               , Sarah Kenny and current world sailing champion committees sit on the world sailing executive, and their recent resignations from NSO executives due to term limits would not affect international limits.
