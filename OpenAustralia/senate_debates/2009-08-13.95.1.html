           . Yes, it is correct that today the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           board had its first constituted meeting of the recently appointed members. One of the first items on its agenda was to formally confirm the application. So the NBN board has today confirmed it. But the work that has commenced in Tasmania was commenced by our partner in Tasmania, Aurora. They have already put ducts up on bridges. As I indicated for you earlier in the week, we will be digging trenches by October, we will be connecting fibre to homes by December and we will be switching on services by July of next year, as we have consistently said.
          </p>
          <p>
           I look forward to your supplementary question, Senator Barnett, but let me be clear: the rollout in Tasmania has commenced. There is fibre currently being put in the ground by Aurora to a number of institutions—hospitals and the like—which will be rolled into the

           . They are currently assets of Aurora and negotiations are taking place. We welcome your ongoing support, Senator Barnett. We welcome your ongoing interest and we look forward to more of your press releases supporting Tas NBN Co.

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
             Doug Campbell
            </a>
            as chairman of the Tasmanian company, why has the minister failed to appoint remaining board members? Isn’t this further evidence that he is simply making it up as he goes along—policy on the run? When will these board members be appointed, if they have not already been appointed?

                    I think this afternoon there will be four names. As I said, I would rather leave it up to the board to put those names out. That is properly their role. There will be a second tranche next week. In total I think there will be seven. I am comfortable to leave both the Tasmanian government to appoint and the board to announce them this afternoon.
