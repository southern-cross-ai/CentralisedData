        My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Senator Birmingham. The Leader of the Opposition,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        , says that Labor will renegotiate the worst parts of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
         TPP
        </a>
        once Labor form government. We know from leaked caucus minutes that the member for Shortland,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Conroy" rel="nofollow">
         Pat Conroy
        </a>
        , said, 'It will be easier to block than to renegotiate later if in government.' Senator Gallacher said, 'There's difficulty in civilising it after it has passed.' Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAllister" rel="nofollow">
         McAllister
        </a>
        said, 'Amendments won't be good enough after the fact.' Can the minister confirm whether or not it is possible to renegotiate the worst parts of the TPP after it has passed or, indeed, will it have to be withdrawn and started all over again?

        <p>
         I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her question. The point that I would make to Senator Hanson-Young is there is no need to renegotiate the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
          TPP
         </a>
         . The TPP is an outstanding agreement that provides sound opportunities for Australian farmers and Australian businesses to be able to increase their opportunities to get into some of the world's largest markets. The TPP will provide, for the first time ever for Australian exporters, preferential access into key markets such as Canada and Mexico, where we currently don't have agreements. The TPP is estimated to provide benefits to the tune of some $15.6 billion to our annual income as Australians by 2030—$15.6 billion! As Senator Cormann rightly says, 'What does that mean for Australian businesses when they can access further markets?' It means they can access more jobs or create more jobs to support higher wages and deliver better opportunities for all Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, the benefits are very clear. The benefits are clear in seeing the complete elimination of tariffs on sheepmeat, on cotton, on seafood, on horticulture, on wine and on manufactured goods. There are large benefits across the board. That of course is why organisations such as the Winemakers' Federation of Australia or the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers'_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          National Farmers' Federation
         </a>
         all fully support ratification of the TPP. They support the deal because they recognise that there are benefits to Australian winemakers, to Australian farmers, as indeed to so many business groups. The question you have to ask when you hear the negativity from some—particularly those on the crossbench—is: why don't they listen to Australia's farmers? Why don't they listen to Australia's winemakers? Why don't they listen to the people who create export dollars and export jobs? One in five jobs are supported by export industries in Australia. Why don't they listen to them?

             This government wants to ratify, not withdraw. This government wants to see the deal that was carefully negotiated to provide benefits to Australians but, indeed, to all

              TPP
             </a>

              Australian Greens
             </a>
             will come in here and they will often ask in estimates and elsewhere about international development assistance. We know full well that, through trade activities, millions of people around the world have been lifted out of poverty. We know that the opportunities will be there for other TPP nations such as Vietnam to see strong growth and benefits realised by them having access to other countries and other markets as well. Yes, there will be benefits for Australia, which is why we should pursue the TPP and why we should deliver it as negotiated, but, indeed, there are benefits for other partners as well, and they are benefits you would have thought those on the crossbench would welcome too.

                    is a good deal. Whatever promises Mr Shorten makes to his caucus are between him and his caucus. I do know when it comes to the promises that Mr Shorten makes to the Australian people that many of them are very hollow indeed, when you think about the fact that Mr Shorten wants to dig deep into the pockets of the Australian people and tax them more when it comes to their income tax and take the savings of Australian retirees.

                       Senator Hanson-Young, you're asking the minister for an opinion on a matter of someone else in another place. If you ask a wide question, you get a wide answer. You have reminded the minister of the question. I note he has 30 seconds remaining. Do you wish to add something, Senator Whish-Wilson?

                             , I noticed during that question from Senator Hanson-Young that the Leader of the Opposition was referred to as

                              You are quite right. That did slip past me. The nature of questions will be addressed in the break, and I will be enforcing the standing orders rather more strictly upon my return, because there has been some slippage about the nature of questions asked. I ask you, Senator Hanson-Young, in the future to use people's appropriate titles.

                               . We were talking about the hollow promises of Mr Shorten, the hollow promises that come from the hollow man who is Mr Shorten. When it comes to Mr Shorten, my firm advice to the Australian people is not to believe a word he says and certainly not to trust him when he says that he can look after the economy or their money. We know that, when it comes to their money, they will end up paying more for taxes on their income and wages, on their housing, on their savings and on their retirement. Ultimately Australians will be worse off under a Shorten government.
