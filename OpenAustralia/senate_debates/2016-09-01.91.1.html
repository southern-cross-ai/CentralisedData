        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. As you are aware, toxic chemicals used in firefighting foam have leaked from the Williamtown
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base at Salt Ash, near Newcastle. The toxic chemicals have been found in water and fish and they have leached into the soil. Residents have been told not to drink bore water or eat any fish or eggs produced in the contaminated area, called the 'red zone'. As well as Salt Ash, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        is investigating 18 sites throughout Australia for contamination, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakey_Army_Aviation_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Oakey Army Aviation Centre
        </a>
        , in Queensland. During the election campaign the Prime Minister promised $55 million for blood testing in epidemiology studies in areas across the country adversely affected by firefighting foam contamination. Given the acute threat to residents—that is, the chemicals found at Salt Ash and Oakey have been linked with kidney cancer, testicular cancer, ulcerated colitis, thyroid disease, hypertension and medically diagnosed high cholesterol—when will the blood testing epidemiology studies begin?

         I thank Senator Burston very much for his first question in this place.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
          If I
         </a>
         am not mistaken, I know that this is a matter of significant interest to him as a local resident, as it is to many people in the broad Williamtown and Salt Ash community. Senator Burston is correct when he says that the government has made a commitment in relation both to voluntary blood testing and the commencement of an epidemiological study. The arrangements for those are underway with the Primary Health Networks, in particular, because there needs to be a proper health based framework through which they can take place, with the support of general practitioners. If individuals have already procured blood tests for their own purposes, then they will be reimbursed. If they wish to do that now, then they will also be reimbursed. The development of the epidemiological study is being done—largely directed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health
         </a>
         , as is entirely appropriate—and the reference points, the outlines, for that are almost complete. The minister for health is awaiting receipt of those.
        </p>
        <p>
         If individuals who participate in the blood-testing process, or who seek blood tests, wish to voluntarily be part of such an epidemiological study, then that would of course be a matter for them. Nobody will be forced or compelled to do that. But in terms of the health information and data that is available on the tracking of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFOS" rel="nofollow">
          PFOS

         and

          PFOA
         </a>
         , or contaminant levels, this will be, if it is participated in by a good number of people in these key areas, one of the leading health studies available in the world. It will assist us in formulating policy in the context of a department such as defence, which finds itself in this position, a department such as health or a department such as environment. We are taking a whole-of-government approach—

           Does the minister agree that because this toxic chemical contamination cannot be neutralised the government should commence a buyback program of affected properties in the red zone so that residents can relocate to a safe environment? If so, when will the buyback begin?

            (—) (): This is a pressing issue for the residents not just in Williamtown, but I would also acknowledge residents in Oakey in Queensland, because there have been some decisions taken by valuers, by financial institutions in relation to land values, in the context of perhaps the current heightened debate. The government has been involved in the process of a very complex series of environmental, ecological and human health assessments. Once the interim health reference values are established by that testing process, once the detailed environmental investigations are concluded and they are underway in both of those areas, then we will be in a much better position to look at the legal implications in relation to land values. This is a very complex issue for those who live in these local areas. I have met with a number of them, and I understand their very, very serious concerns.
