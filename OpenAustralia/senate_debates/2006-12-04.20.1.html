        My question is to Senator Santoro, the Minister for Ageing. Is the minister aware that a review ordered of Greenmount Gardens Nursing Centre, in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , last month found that it was failing to meet critical care standards including clinical care, medication and pain management and nutrition and hydration? Doesn’t the audit team’s report conclude that: residents were being incorrectly administered medication; residents at risk of dehydration were not being identified; and, due to staff shortages, staff did not have the time to ensure appropriate care was provided and documented? Can the minister explain to families and residents why no sanctions or penalties have been imposed on this facility, when it was clearly failing to deliver appropriate care to frail elderly residents?

         I have just sought to consult my briefing notes for specific aged-care facilities. I do not have a briefing note on that in my folder. I undertake to look into the issues that have been raised by Senator Webber and I will make a statement if necessary as early as possible.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I appreciate the fact that the minister is going to come back to the Senate with some information but does not this case follow that of Elizabeth House Private Nursing Home earlier this year—one I know the minister is aware of—which failed 30 of the 44 care standards but was not sanctioned like the facility that my grandmother lives in, which he is also aware of? Is the minister able to provide the same personal guarantee to the residents of Greenmount Gardens that he gave on 18 October this year, when he promised that every resident in the Elizabeth House Private Nursing Home was receiving top quality care?

           I wish to note today that my personal guarantee to Senator Webber has not been called into question since I gave that personal guarantee. As I said a minute or so ago, I do not have the specific information that Senator Webber wishes for. She would appreciate that there are over 3,000 aged-care facilities that are accredited throughout Australia. Obviously, I cannot have a brief on each and every one of them, but I undertake to get back as soon as possible if there is in fact anything to report.
