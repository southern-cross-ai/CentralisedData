        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. The Earle Haven Retirement Village on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        in Queensland recently closed, with more than 70 residents transported to other aged-care facilities and a public hospital. I want to acknowledge that we all feel deeply concerned about the sudden closure of this facility, and our thoughts are with those residents, families, carers and staff. When did the minister first become aware that there was a dispute at the Earle Haven aged-care facility, that it was going to close and that the safety of residents was at risk?

         I thank Senator Watt for the question. I also, along with him, express my complete dismay at the events that occurred at Earle Haven on 11 July. What happened was a complete and utter disgrace. How what seems to be a contractual dispute between two parties could descend to the extent that 71 aged and frail Australians were left without care is, quite frankly, beyond me, and I suspect beyond Senator Watt and many others.
        </p>
        <p>
         I first heard that there were concerns about what was happening at Earle Haven on the afternoon of 11 July. It was first transmitted to me as the suggestion of a facility going into administration. It wasn't until later in the evening, when more detailed reports came to me, that the appearance of a contractual dispute came to light. Later that evening, I had a much fuller briefing from the department, at which the circumstances of the events were then transmitted to me. At this point, I would also like to express my appreciation to, firstly, the staff at Earle Haven, who had the foresight to ring 000 when these events started to unfold, which led to the declaration of an emergency by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Queensland Health

         . I also express my appreciation to Queensland Health for their actions.

            With Senator Watt's indulgence, I'll just complete a couple of points I want to make in relation to where I just finished off the previous question. As I said, I want to express sincere appreciation to the staff who stayed—despite what I understand were instructions from their employer to leave the facility—to look after the residents. That needs to be acknowledged. Also, to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Health" rel="nofollow">
             Queensland Health
            </a>
            and emergency services for the work that they did in relocating the residents to other facilities around the region. It took a considerable period of time. It was a difficult operation and it was important that it was conducted properly. I would also like to express my appreciation for the other facilities in the region who took up that capacity. In respect of Senator Watt's specific question, there are over 5,000 places in that particular region of Queensland with an occupancy level of about 88 per cent, so there is still some capacity in the region.

             I thank the minister for his remarks about the efforts made by staff and other people to rectify this situation. On that matter, what action has the minister taken to protect the Earle Haven workers who have not been paid outstanding wages and superannuation? Will the minister commit to ensuring these staff are paid what they are owed?

              Like Senator Watt, and I expect everyone else in this place, I am also concerned at reports that staff have not been paid their full entitlements, including superannuation. As I understand it, this is a contractual dispute between two parties and not about the financial viability of either party. In that circumstance, the staff should be paid their full entitlements. I would urge the parties that have not paid—and I understand that is an organisation by the name of HelpStreet—to fully pay their staff, to fully pay all of the entitlements that are due to their staff, because the staff had no part in this. They are not party to the dispute and they should be paid.
