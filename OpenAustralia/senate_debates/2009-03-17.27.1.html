        was killed yesterday in Afghanistan. At the request of the soldier’s family, his name will not be released at this time, but I can inform the Senate that he was serving as a member of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force. He died while his patrol and their

        colleagues came under attack by Taliban insurgents. The government has been advised that no other Australians were wounded in the engagement.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of this incident, nine Australian soldiers have now, tragically, lost their lives in Afghanistan. Afghanistan remains a highly dangerous place, but it is a central part of our ongoing fight against extremism. We should always remember that, in the past, international terrorism found a safe haven in Afghanistan under the Taliban. We cannot allow this to happen again. The government remains committed to confronting the ongoing threat from international terrorism and bringing greater stability to Afghanistan. It is a very sad day and we are again reminded that some who wear Australia’s uniform make the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf. I would like to extend our best wishes to those still serving in Afghanistan and to their families, who, I know, will be worrying about their safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure all senators join me in extending our thoughts and best wishes to the soldier’s family at this very, very difficult time. On behalf of the Australian government, I extend my condolences to the soldier’s family, his friends and of course all his ADF colleagues, who will feel the loss very deeply.

          Australian soldier

As Senator Evans properly said, we are again reminded of the significant dangers that our Australian defence personnel do face serving in Afghanistan, where they are performing a vital role in endeavouring to bring peace and stability to that very troubled country. It is tragic that we are here today sending our condolences to the family of the ninth Australian soldier killed serving our country in Afghanistan since 2001. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of this soldier as they come to terms with his tragic death while serving his country. We also fully appreciate why his family would want to keep their privacy at this difficult time.

We Greens do not agree with the deployment of Australian troops to Afghanistan, but we totally and unreservedly support our service men and women, wherever they might be on the globe, in the service of this nation. We are thinking of those who are grieving now. We add our words of strength and condolence and thankfulness that such an Australian was in the service of this country. There are many more of them serving this country and they are true patriots.

             Australian soldier
            </a>
            who was killed yesterday serving his country in Afghanistan. I express my condolences to his family and friends. At the request of his family, the personal details of the soldier remain private, but we still know much about him. We know that he was someone prepared to put his life on the line for his fellow soldiers and for his country. We know that he was courageous and we know that he paid the highest price for his courage, loyalty and commitment to the ideals of freedom. We know that he had a family who loved him and were no doubt enormously proud of him. We know that all Australians now honour his memory. We know that he was the ninth Australian to die serving in Afghanistan.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is very important that the Senate recognise the death of this soldier and the death of each and every Australian killed serving their country. This soldier’s life was not lost in vain. The thoughts and prayers of Family First are with his family at this very difficult time.
