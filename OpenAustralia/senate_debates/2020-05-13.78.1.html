        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Darcy Moran, from Victoria, has been a hospitality worker for 15 years and has never been unemployed during that time. Yet, like 46 per cent of casuals in that sector, Darcy has been with his current employer for less than 12 months, making him ineligible for JobKeeper. Does the minister think it is fair to exclude Darcy and workers like him from the program?

        <p>
         What we think would be fair to Darcy is if the state government in Victoria started easing restrictions so that businesses in Victoria could employ people like Darcy and give people like Darcy a job. That is what we think would be fair. That is point No. 1.
        </p>
        <p>
         You have asked if it would be fair. We want to see businesses around Australia start getting back into business so they can hire more Australians again, including people like Darcy. In relation to the JobKeeper program, which provides support to more than 5.5 million working Australians, the eligibility criteria are very clear. The program is designed to keep employees connected to their employer where that is possible. In relation to casuals, that relates to long-term casuals where there is an established relationship with the employer. In fact, it is based on the definition in the Fair Work Act. It is the Fair Work Act that describes a long-term casual as somebody who has been with the same employer for at least 12 months, and that is of course what we are using. It is not right to say that there is no support available to Darcy. I don't know the specific circumstances, but, for those who find themselves unfortunately out of a job in the current circumstances, the appropriate jobseeker support arrangements are in place, supplemented by the COVID supplement, which effectively doubles the jobseeker payment. That is of course the appropriate way for us to provide an enhanced social safety net in the circumstances. But it is now timeâ€”

           ABS figures released last week showed that hospitality has been one of the hardest-hit sectors in this crisis, with more than a third of jobs lost. With 78 per cent of hospitality workers casual, does the minister agree that the workers who are hardest hit by this crisis have the least access to JobKeeper?

            I certainly agree that the hospitality sector is one of the sectors that have been hardest hit, and it's also a sector that can recover very quickly once the restrictions are eased. Indeed, there is an opportunity now for restrictions to be eased and for the hospitality sector to start increasing its activity again so that it can start employing more Australians. That is something that we would like to see happen, phased in appropriately over the next few weeks and months. All of these announcements have been made. The truth is that there are appropriate supports in place for workers in the circumstance where they have lost their job. The jobseeker payments have been effectively doubled through the COVID supplement, which is in place for a six-month period.

              Up to one million workers who contribute to industries like hospitality, health, education and caregiving will miss out on JobKeeper, lose their job and lose their connection to their workplace. These workers have been there for Australians, including during this crisis. Why is the government not there for them now?

              <p>
               For every jobseeker who is unable to find a job, we've of course eased eligibilityâ€”we've waived waiting periods. We've waived various tests that are required to be met, and we've also made adjustments to the partner income and the like. So we've made it easier for people to access jobseeker if they're out of work. We've effectively doubled the jobseeker payment to help Australians who've lost their job through this period.
              </p>
              <p>
               In relation to JobKeeper, as I've indicatedâ€”and I think we've gone around and around this issue for some time nowâ€”this is about keeping workers with an established connection to an employer connected to their employer, and, indeed, that is what this program is there for. As far as casuals are concerned, we have included casuals, but we have included long-term casuals, who have worked for the same employer for more than 12 months. That is an appropriate test. It's a test that is reflected in the Fair Work Act already, and that is, of course, why we provided it.
