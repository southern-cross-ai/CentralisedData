           Australia has a robust system of political disclosures overseen by the independent
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Electoral Commission
           </a>
           . Under changes introduced by this government to improve transparency, political campaigner disclosures have now been published for the first time, which reveal that nine unions spent almost $33 million on electoral expenditure in 2018-19, with just the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
            ACTU
           </a>
           spending over $21.2 million. When including third-party electoral expenditure, unions spent almost $35 million in 2018-19. A complete ban on corporate donations is misguided and will create an uneven playing field between big unions and other organisations in the Australian community, as well as posing potential constitutional problems. A $1,000 unindexed threshold is very low, and such a measure would risk increasing red tape and discouraging individuals from participating in the political process for fear of intimidation or retribution from political opponents.

              does agree with the whole concept of this notice of motion, but I'd have to draw attention to section (f), where it states 'further recognises that donations to political parties revealed in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Electoral Commission
              </a>
              disclosures published on Monday demonstrate the need for urgent political donations reform'. That notice published on Monday was basically that the media said it was donations to the political party. It wasn't. It was revenue that was collected by the political parties from January 2018 to 2019. They were not political donations. It comes from membership and it comes from revenue and sales by the party, therefore I dispute the over $3 million as political donations to the political party that was published in the paper last Monday.
