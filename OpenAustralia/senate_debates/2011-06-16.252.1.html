        I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendment to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 10 May 2011. I move:

        It is proposed to move two government amendments to address important recommendations made by the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in its report on the bill dated 22 March 2011. The bill amends subsection 49 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AML" rel="nofollow">
         AML
        </a>
        /
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTF" rel="nofollow">
         CTF
        </a>
        Act to extend the power to obtain further information in relation to the report made to AUSTRAC beyond the reporting entity to any other person. This change to the AML/CTF Act is strongly supported by AUSTRAC and law enforcement agencies, as the extended information-gathering power will assist with preliminary investigations into serious and organised crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first amendment relates to the requirement for reasonable belief. It provides that a notice requesting further information or documents may only be issued if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the recipient has knowledge of the information or possession or control of the document sought. This government amendment will ensure that the person is not subject to this coercive power without proper justification, and it is in keeping with broad government policy and the recommendation of the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second proposed amendment provides a minimum 14-day compliance period where the recipient of the notice is not the reporting entity who initially communicated the report to AUSTRAC. However, the amendment allows a period of fewer than 14 days where it is necessary and reasonable in the circumstances. The Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills queried whether a 14-day period should be applicable, as this is generally considered the minimum time in which the response can reasonably be expected. The proposed amendment addresses this issue and ensures that the minimum time frames are provided in the legislation. The ability to require a shorter time frame recognises that AUSTRAC and law enforcement agencies will often require prompt responses so that they can effectively carry out their investigations.

         I have to say that I am at something of a disadvantage at this point. I am representing Senator Brandis, who cannot be in the chamber this evening, and I am not aware of any amendments being moved to this bill by the government. The minutes have not been circulated the chamber, at least as far as I can tell, this afternoon—there are none on any of the desks on this side as far as I can see.

           Thank you, Madam Temporary Chair. I am grateful to receive a copy, which I now have. I am prepared to accept the minister's assurance that he has discussed these amendments with my colleague Senator Brandis and that Senator Brandis indicated some measure of agreement with them.

           Question agreed to.
