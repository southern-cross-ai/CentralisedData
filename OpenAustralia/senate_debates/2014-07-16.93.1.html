        My question is to the Minister for Defence. I refer the minister to an answer he gave on
        <i>

        on 12 June when asked whether the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
         ANZUS
        </a>
        alliance commits Australia to support the United States if it is in a conflict in our region. The minister said, 'I do not believe it does.'
       </p>
       <p>
        I also refer the minister to the

         May I thank the shadow minister for attending a funeral yesterday in Gosford. The point about speculating and hypotheticals in what is our most important strategic relationship is, quite frankly, trite and not helpful. What was put to me was a hypothetical situation as to whether Australia was 'bound'—that was the word used by the journalist. The fact simply is that the alliance requires us to consult. Of course that is exactly what Australia and the United States would do in circumstances where there is a serious threat to the interests of either. We are not going to speculate about matters that are particularly and dangerously hypothetical.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let's talk about this relationship. Australia has since 1952 had one of the strongest strategic alliances of any country in the world with the United States. It is a mutually beneficial relationship. Speculation as to the hypotheticals is simply not helpful. We get on with our business together. We do very, very good work together in maintaining and surveilling international stability—of course, for 11 years in Afghanistan and for many years in Iraq together. The senator would know that we have as a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes" rel="nofollow">
          Five Eyes
         </a>
         community serious responsibility together to surveil counterterrorism activities. The relationship is a very strong one, and I particularly work very hard—almost every day—to make sure that relationship continues to be very successful.

              The circumstances surrounding an engagement by either of us in conflict will be varied and diversified. It is simply not helpful. But the question was: are we bound? We are bound to consult and, if our national interest is at stake, I think the answer is very, very obvious to everybody, given Australia's historical connection to the United States and our historical engagement with them in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">
               North Africa

              and wherever you went to look. We have a long and proud engagement with the United States in maintaining stability and peace throughout the world.

                Let's just underline the national interest here. There is no national interest in us speculating about these matters. We have gone forward with the United States at every opportunity as a trusted friend and as a trusted ally, and I believe they are very happy with the way the ANZUS alliance is working.
