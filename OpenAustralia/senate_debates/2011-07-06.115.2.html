       Cluster Munitions

      <p class="italic">
       To the Honourable President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The petition of the undersigned shows that we are concerned that cluster munitions are a large cause of death and disability to civilian populations and that the Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010 does not meet Australia's obligations under the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Your petitioners ask that the Senate vote to amend the Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010 to more closely reflect the goals of the Convention on Cluster Munitions towards achieving a total ban on cluster munitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       by Senator Birmingham (from 247 citizens).
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia is a signatory to the international Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM). Legislation now needs to be passed to enable Australia to ratify the CCM. However, the Criminal Code Amendment (Cluster Munitions Prohibition) Bill 2010 falls significantly short of meeting the purpose of the CCM.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The main concerns with the Bill are:

      <ul>

      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p class="italic">
       The Senate has the power to see to it that the Bill is fixed to meet Australia's obligations under the Convention. Take action now! Sign the petition below and demand that the Senate fixes the Bill!
