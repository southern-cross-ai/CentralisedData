           It is one of those matters which is a longstanding foreign affairs issue. The government has a longstanding practice of not dealing with complex foreign policy matters through Senate motions. The government does not support boycotts that impede legitimate trade between states and has expressed its strong opposition to the Marrickville council's earlier proposed boycotts, disinvestment and sanctions campaign against Israel.
          </p>
          <p>
           The motion moved by the Senator Abetz does appear to be more concerned with politics than expressing support for Israel. I ask Senator Abetz if he would care to explain to the Senate why at the last federal election the Liberal Party directed preferences to Greens candidates in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           , in particular why the Liberal Party directed preferences to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Byrne" rel="nofollow">
            Sam Byrne
           </a>
           , the Greens candidate for Grayndler, which covers Marrickville council. But without turning this into the politics that Senator Abetz has expressed, the longstanding practice really highlights the issue that I have indicated—that is, they are complex foreign policy matters and on that basis it has been long practice that we do not support this motion.

              I foreshadow that I will seek to amend this motion to make reference to the detrimental effect of the Israeli blockade in Gaza on the Palestinian people living in Gaza, and also to note that Australia is a good friend of the Palestinian territories and its people. I did previously circulate a motion which simply referred to the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian people. That is not correct in the sense that the blockade is confined, if you want to use that word, to Gaza. But if we are going to move this motion, it is important to also state as a matter of fact the impact on the Palestinians in Gaza in terms of the blockade. I did give notice earlier to my colleagues, as soon as I could, but I do seek to move from the floor an amendment to the motion to put at the end of Senator Abetz's motion. I move:

               Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order for your consideration in relation to the amendment that Senator Xenophon has moved. This is a motion relating solely to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDS" rel="nofollow">
                BDS
               </a>
               situation—that is, the boycotts, divestment and sanctions policy against Israel. Senator Xenophon is now trying to introduce other extraneous matters not directly relevant to the motion and, interestingly enough, on a technical point, it is interesting that Senator Xenophon sees the need to note the detrimental effect of the Israeli blockade on the people of Gaza, but allegedly the Egyptian blockade on the people of Gaza can be completely ignored and that is the evil of the BDS policy because what it seeks to do—

                     The Labor Party come into this place with a lame excuse that this is somehow a complex issue. On 23 March this year it was not a complex issue. What has made it complex for the

                     is that they are unable to justify why so many of their affiliated unions, and indeed the state division of the Labor Party, of which their foreign minister, Mr Rudd, is a member, have passed motions in support of this objectionable policy.

                        In relation to Senator Xenophon's amendment, I do find it quite objectionable—and I say that to my good friend—that all he is concerned about is the Israeli blockade of the Gazan people and there is no concern about Egypt. That is why the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDS" rel="nofollow">
                         BDS
                        </a>
                        policy that the Greens have been promoting is so wrong: it only seeks to condemn Israel and not Egypt. Why don't we have a BDS policy on Egypt courtesy of the Greens, especially from
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                        </a>
                        ? Why doesn't that concern Senator Xenophon?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The amendment he has moved has unfortunately shown what is actually behind this. Is it that Australia is a good friend of the Palestinian territories and its people? I have no objection to that. But that is not part and parcel of what we are dealing with. We are dealing with the evil of the BDS policy which Senator Bob Brown himself has finally come to reject in the wake of the New South Wales state election where one of the Green candidates clearly did not win a seat against Labor because of that policy. I say to the people of New South Wales, 'Well done!'
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In relation to the allocation of preferences that Senator Ludwig raised, I say to Senator Ludwig: in the New South Wales election for that seat, the Liberal Party did not allocate preferences. The Labor Party did and put Fiona Byrne at No. 2 on the how-to-vote card in the state election, so please do not come in here and try to lecture and hector us. I know it is embarrassing for certain elements in this place that the anti-Israel stance being taken by some political parties and groups, such as trade unions, does need to be opposed.

                            I am very grateful to Senator Abetz for his contribution. It was remiss of me not to include the Egyptian blockade. I do not have the expertise that Senator Abetz clearly has in foreign affairs. I think it is a fair point. Clearly the blockade, whether it is by Israel or Egypt, on Gaza and the impact on the Palestinian people is something that is causing detriment and that should be noted. That was the intent of the motion. I seek your guidance, Mr

                            , as to whether I can withdraw my previous amendment and move another amendment which would incorporate Egypt as well as Israel in terms of the blockade. This could be dealt with to incorporate the concerns raised by Senator Abetz, and I am grateful, genuinely, to him for raising that.

Tim is a very honourable man but a person who is on the record as being, and whom I have heard on certain occasions being, very hostile towards the Israeli government. ll I am doing is pointing out to you that you are trying to single out for a political purpose the fact that there may be people in our party or in the trade union movement who have a particular view on the

                                        It is our job to think about it and to debate it. We should not merely find ourselves fighting over it. We should also find some way of actually helping more than the world has helped in the past to ensure the security of the people of Israel and their right to live in peace into the future as well as the right of the people of Palestine to have their own country with equal security to chart their own future in the same way as the rest of the world does. It is incredibly important that we try to limit in the future the violence that we have seen in the past from both sides and to give a peace dividend to the whole region by having those two peoples living in peace with each other. Maybe we should set aside a full and open debate at some stage in this chamber to talk about just that. They deserve it, and we deserve to do it in a constructive way that would end in a peace which would in turn make all of us on this planet a bit more secure and happy.

                                           I wish to put a proposition to Senator Xenophon. Is Senator Xenophon willing to acknowledge on the record that the blockade is in response to acts of terror perpetrated by Hamas from the Palestinian territories on Israel? If he would be willing to acknowledge that on the record, we would be minded to support his amendment. That would be the caveat.

                                                 Or his proposition; I think it was an invitation as well as a proposition, Senator Siewert. The position is this: there is no doubt, on the basis of the discussions I have had with members of the Palestinian community and the friends of Palestine here in Australia, that both the Egyptian and the Israeli blockades have had an enormous impact on Palestinians who are completely innocent of any involvement with Hamas. The effect on children and on the supply of medicines is quite profound. I note that the Israeli government says that they have instituted the blockade in response to the role of Hamas; but things such as pasta, pencils and stationery have been blockaded. So I think that the blockade goes well beyond issues of security.

I think that is completely unacceptable, and I want that to be on the record; but in the context of this motion I believe it to be appropriate that we acknowledge the impact of the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian people. That in itself should not be seen as an endorsement in any way whatsoever of a terrorist organisation such as Hamas; instead it is about the impact of the blockade on innocent Palestinians and the very deep detrimental effects on those Palestinians.
