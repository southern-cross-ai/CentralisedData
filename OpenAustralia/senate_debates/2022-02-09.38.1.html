         Australia Day
        </a>
        I was honoured to attend a citizenship ceremony hosted by Archerfield Rotary Club. It was followed by a wonderful Australia Day family funfair. At the ceremony I said to the conferees that, if they were looking for examples of contributing to our beautiful country, they need look no further than members of the Archerfield Rotary Club. I have previously spoken in this place about the work of the club, including drought relief and assisting our Pacific family in times of need.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week, one of the club's members, Mark Ledwidge, passed away. Mark had become an Australian citizen at the first citizenship ceremony convened by Archerfield Rotary Club, in 2006. For 26 years and 10 months he had been an outstanding contributor to the club, serving as president, secretary and treasurer. Mark Ledwidge was a Paul Harris Fellow—a great honour amongst Rotarians. He was involved in all of the projects undertaken by Archerfield Rotary Club—not just in Australia but in Fiji,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        , India and Africa. Members of the club described him thus:
       </p>
       <p>
        Mark was such a kind, gentle soul. He did many things to improve the lives of those less fortunate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Such a dedicated man, the man with a smile and sense of humour always.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …the kindest soul who never spoke ill of anyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to provide my sincere condolences to Mark's wife, Brenda, his three sons and other family and friends. I have no doubt that Archerfield Rotary Club will continue its great community work. That is the best tribute which can be paid to Mark Ledwidge, whose life of service provides an inspiring example to all Australians.
