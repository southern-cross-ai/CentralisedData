        My question is for the Minister for Finance, Senator Birmingham. Minister, there are 75 politicians up here right now who own a second home in Canberra. Each and every one of them can claim the full rate of travel allowance—nearly 300 bucks—to sleep in the comfort of their own bed this evening. That's $20,000 in free money going out to 75 politicians tonight alone. I reckon it should be illegal for politicians to claim full travel allowance to sleep in their own bed. It's not allowed anywhere else in the country, so why should Canberra be any different?

         I thank Senator Lambie for the question. The rates of travel allowance and arrangements for travel allowance are set independently through the Remuneration Tribunal. It has been a longstanding practice that, in relation to the rates paid for members and senators to stay in Canberra relative to the rates paid in other capital cities, there is a discounted rate applied in Canberra, recognising and, indeed, encouraging members and senators to make longer-term arrangements in relation to their accommodation in Canberra. That's a private matter for each member and senator to undertake, but the government stands by the independent process of the Remuneration Tribunal on these matters.

           I think we get that no-one is breaking any rules here; politicians are allowed to claim full travel allowance to stay in their investment properties in Canberra. I am not denying that. But, as the finance minister, do you seriously have no problem with politicians using travel allowance to pay their own mortgages and then come out with a nice hit at the end when they leave parliament? Do you have no issues with that?

            I simply make the observation that, as I indicated in the primary answer, the rate that is applied for overnight stays in Canberra is assessed in a slightly different way by the Remuneration Tribunal compared with the rate for commercial accommodation provision in other capital cities of Australia. In terms of the cost effectiveness for the government's finances, it would concern me were we in a situation that changes were made that potentially increased the cost by increasing the nightly rate that was paid. Again I back the independent processes there that seek to find the right approach to respect taxpayers' dollars, to minimise costs where possible and to ensure that, indeed, recompense is made to enable members and senators to make their own arrangements for overnight accommodation as is necessary in Canberra.

              —no-one's getting an inch here, by the way—billed taxpayers $17,000 in travel allowance to stay in his Canberra flat while Sydney was in lockdown last year. He says he has no plans to change the rules either; he doesn't see a need to. I just wanted to clarify this: to the best of your knowledge, the Liberal Party, the Nationals and the Labor Party are on a unity ticket because of their own sense of self-entitlement when it comes to claiming this money from the taxpayer.

               I reject the assertions made there. What we are indeed backing is an independent process that has been in place for many years for the Remuneration Tribunal to make independent assessments at arm's length from politicians. I am not, as finance minister, and Mr Morton is not, as
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
                Special Minister of State
               </a>
               , responsible for setting the rates, terms or arrangements for travel allowances. It is, of course, a fact that every one of us here aside from Senator Gallagher, Senator Seselja and perhaps Senator Molan travel here away from our homes and do incur costs of some form or other in relation to the accommodation while we are here. As I said, it's been a longstanding practice the Remuneration Tribunal has applied in terms of the flexibility of that, but that is also reflected in the different rates as they are calculated, and that's why the independent approach is the appropriate approach.
