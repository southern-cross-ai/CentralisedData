        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 1199 standing in the name of Senator Back, relating to the government response to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee's report into higher education and skills training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand that the amendment has been circulated in the chamber. Just for a point of clarification, it is essentially, in part (b)(i), removing the words 'apologise to the Senate and the agricultural community for' and replacing them with 'explain'. But I understand that it has been circulated and was agreed to, so I am just seeking clarification on that.

          At the request of Senator Back, I move the motion as amended:
         </p>
         <p>
          That the Senateâ€”
         </p>
         <p>
          (a) notes that:
         </p>
         <p>
          (i) the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee tabled its report,
          <i>
           Higher education and skills training to support agriculture and agribusiness in Australia on 21 June 2012 with the support of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Greens
           </a>
           and without dissent of the Labor senators,
          </i>
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) eleven recommendations were made relating to:
         </p>
         <p>
          ( a) encouraging a greater understanding by children and teachers in metropolitan and regional centres of the importance of agriculture to our community,
         </p>
         <p>
          ( b) cost effective delivery of post-secondary skills and higher education in Australia,
         </p>
         <p>
          ( c) options for more effective collaboration between institutions and their relationships with federal, state and other providers,
         </p>
         <p>
          ( d) the decline in public investment in research and development in agricultural activity, its association with productivity in the sector and the reduced emphasis on agricultural extension, and
         </p>
         <p>
          ( e) the establishment of a national peak industry representative body for agricultural production and agribusiness sectors, and
         </p>
         <p>
          (iii) the Government failed to respond to the report by the required date of 23 September 2012, being 3 months from the tabling of the report, in accordance with continuing resolution 42(1), and has still not responded some 6 months after the due date to respond; and
         </p>
         <p>
          (b) calls on the Government to:
         </p>
         <p>
          (i) explain their failure to respond in the timeframe required under the resolution, and
         </p>
         <p>
          (ii) respond to the report and its recommendations without delay.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question agreed to.
