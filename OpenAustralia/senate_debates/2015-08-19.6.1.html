        <p>
         This bill, the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2015, follows the Acts and Instruments Framework Reform Bill 2014, the principal bill. That bill was amended to accept one recommendation made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and passed the parliament, with Labor support, on 5 March this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The principal bill implemented the recommendations of a statutory review of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 under the former Labor government in 2008. That review was led by a committee, comprising Mr Anthony Blunn, Mr Ian Govey and Professor John McMillan. That bill made a number of reforms to the arrangements for delegated legislation under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. That act, now named the Legislation Act, sets out a comprehensive regime for the registration, tabling, scrutiny and repeal of legislative instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
         This bill makes a number of consequential technical machinery and drafting changes to the bill. The bill updates references across the statute book to the Legislative Instruments Act to reflect its change of name to the Legislation Act; compiles the list of instruments exempt from sunsetting and disallowance, presently found in various locations into one central list in regulation to be made under the Legislation Act; clarifies the status of rules of court under the Legislation Act; and repeals spent provisions and makes various technical and drafting corrections to the Legislation Act.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are minor and technical changes. As Labor indicated when the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Bill came to this place, we support any measures which make Commonwealth instruments easier to locate and understand. I commend the bill to the Senate.

          I thank Senator Collins for her contribution on the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2015.

          Further, the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Act also amends the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, including clarifying and expanding provisions dealing with machinery of government changes, and other amendments to support those made to the Legislative Instruments Act. The reforms made by the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Act will improve the operation and clarity of the legislative framework for Commonwealth instruments and Acts.

         </p>
         <p>
          This bill also makes minor amendments to the Legislation Act and the Acts Interpretation Act, as amended by the Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) Act, to clarify the application of their requirements to administrative forms. It makes minor amendments to the definition of a legislative instrument in the relevant act to clarify the status of court rules of states and territories. It makes minor amendments to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
           Family Law Act
          </a>
          1975 to clarify that provisions of the Family Law Act which set out the application of the Legislative Instruments Act to rules of the Family Court apply to those rules whether they are made under the Family Law Act or another act and it makes other minor consequential amendments to Commonwealth acts, repeals several spent provisions, and makes minor technical corrections to the Legislation Act.
