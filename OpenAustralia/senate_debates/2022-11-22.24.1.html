        I also rise today as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Voice
        </a>
        to Parliament, which is an initiative by Raise Our Voice. Today I speak in this chamber for 11-year-old Jacob Tubui, a year 6 student at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart_School" rel="nofollow">
         Sacred Heart School
        </a>
        in Cabramatta. I spoke earlier today with Jacob and his teacher Mrs Gonzalez. When asked what Australia's new parliament should accomplish, Jacob prepared the following speech:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I firmly believe that the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        should assist the people of Australia by lowering taxes. Taxes aren't helping. They are way too high, and they don't motivate people to work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Good afternoon my name is Jacob and I don't technically live in Fowler but my school is located here. I strongly believe that the growth in taxes will not help the economy in any way. Taxes can have many varieties of charges.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Taxes are chargeable when you work more, so the more you spend all your effort on working just to survive, you will get taxed more.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Citizens are working hours just to be taxed four to five percent of their income from working and this can be higher the more you work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In about 15 years I would start to work and wouldn't be motivated to put in the time and effort it takes to work just for the government to take a percentage out of your income.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People who don't have a decent income from work shouldn't be charged tax at all. I hope this message spreads and that taxes should be lowered immediately because it does not help the economy with anything. Instead, it tells citizens that their hard-earned money is being taken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I really hope the new Australian Government can help to lower taxes for all the people of this great nation. Thank you.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Jacob: thank you for your effort, good luck with your studies and I wish you a happy future.
