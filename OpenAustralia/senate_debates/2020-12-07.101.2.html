       <p class="italic">
        The current Aged Care Funding Instrument (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACFI" rel="nofollow">
         ACFI
        </a>

         Passage
        </a>
        of this bill by the end of December 2020 is required to put in place a key enabler of the new funding model — independent assessment of aged care residents for the purposes of resident classification — from 1 March 2021. The classification data collected over at least one year from 1 March 2021 will enable the Government to consider the appropriate amount of funding that each classification should attract in future if the Government decides to implement the new funding model.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Independent assessment will require a workforce of approximately 275 full time equivalent health professionals to act under delegation of the Secretary of the Department of Health to assess all residential aged care recipients for classification purposes between March 2021 and February 2022. A significant proportion of the assessors will need to be recruited and trained in January and February 2021 to achieve a I March 2021 start date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the bill is not dealt with in one sitting period the new assessment workforce cannot be recruited and trained to commence assessments from i March 2021, with flow on effects for the possible future commencement of the new funding model.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill responds to recommendations of the March 2019 Resource Utilisation and Classification Study (RUCS), which recommended fundamental change to the residential aged care funding system, including to the method of permanent residential aged care recipient classification and to associated distribution of funding among residential aged care providers.

As the registration scheme commenced as planned on 30 September 2020, it is important that the legislative package is completed to implement the legal mechanism and to provide clarity to industry.

       <p class="italic">
        It is important that the bill is passed by the end of the 2020 Spring sittings to provide certainty for Medicare providers about the manner in which compliance provisions are applied. Medicare benefits are recovered from providers in circumstances where a provider makes incorrect claims, including where the patient has not received the services to which they were entitled. These amendments enable the Department to establish a debt based on the provision of false or misleading information, providing further consistency between claims lodged digitally or manually. This will support Medicare compliance processes, ensuring that patients receive the care for which Medicare benefits are paid, the Medicare program is not misused and Commonwealth money is protected.

The bill will remove the limit on the entitlement to free English tuition and remove time limits on enrolling in, commencing and completing English tuition for certain eligible migrants. The bill will also raise the upper limit on eligibility from functional English to vocational English, and allow for the delivery of English tuition to those migrants who are outside of Australia but intending to migrate to Australia (those who have applied for or have been granted certain eligible visas).

        The bill requires urgent passage in the 2020 Spring sittings to enable the Government to better support migrants with low English proficiency to learn the national language, as a key enabler for social cohesion and to boost the employment and/or further education prospects of migrants (a critical priority given the economic challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic).

       <p class="italic">
        Urgent passage of the bill in the 2020 Spring sittings would also enable the Government to remove disincentives to English language learning, and to commence providing English tuition to many migrants who are currently ineligible for the program, due to not meeting the current timeframes for enrolment, commencement or completion of AMEP tuition.
