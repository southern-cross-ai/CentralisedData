        My question is to the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham. Yesterday the Liberal member for Menzies,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Andrews
        </a>
        , said that the Turnbull government's modelling that showed a $4.6 billion cut to Catholic schools 'has not been provided to the party room; I hope it will be provided tomorrow'—which is today. Has the minister now come clean with the coalition MPs and senators and provided his department's data showing a $4.6 billion cut to Catholic schools?

           I had great pleasure in talking to the coalition party room this morning about how it is that Labor's $22 billion that they run around the country talking about is just funny money, how it is that the $22 billion that they claim was money that of course was never in the budget, was never paid for, was never funded and is funding that nobody could ever have possibly banked upon, in contrast to what those opposite claim, as they run around, plucking figures out from the $22 billion and saying, 'This much may have been for this sector; that much may have been for another sector.' The coalition is firmly committed to providing—

             Well, thank you, Senator Cameron. The minister did go to address the fact that he has spoken to his colleagues this morning, and I think we need to give the minister, in his remaining one minute and 19 seconds, a bit more of a chance to flesh out that answer.

              I was very directly addressing Senator Collins's question in that I explained to the coalition party room this morning that people can roll out all of these different bits of the $22 billion of pretend money, of funny money, of fake money that the Labor Party runs around saying that they had there somewhere for schools on the never-never horizon. But compare it with the Turnbull government, which has presented a clear model, which is proposing legislation for a clear model, which has put in place the budget savings to ensure we can address and put in the $18.6 billion extra we are proposing. Those opposite keep running around with their fantasy money, Senator Collins, with the fantasy $22 billion—

                  Indeed, I think the explanations were very clear about the fact that people plucked out of this $22 billion magical figures to say that this group of schools could have gotten this much or that group of schools could have gotten a different amount. In the end we all know, of course, that the Labor Party never delivers on their promises, that they budget things that they can never afford to pay for and that in this instance once again the Labor Party are making promises that they will never keep in the future.

                      On a far more serious note, one Liberal MP has said it was 'a major mistake' to provide the data to the Senate crossbench but not to the coalition party room. Was it a mistake, Minister, or was the minister intentionally withholding the data that reveals a $4.6 billion cut to Catholic schools?

                       , but I certainly will not take her at her word when it comes to talk about cuts, because time and time again in this place I have been very clear about the additional funding growth that is there. In relation to the Catholic education system in Australia, there is $3.4 billion of growth built in over the next 10 years—year on year growth for Catholic education systems across each of the states of Australia. This is a growth factor that ensures each of them will ultimately be treated equally, fairly, across the Commonwealth, regardless of the state boundaries but based on the needs of those individual systems. That is why it provides faster rates of growth to Catholic education systems in states like

                          Parents of hardworking Catholic education families, hardworking families in the public education system and hardworking families in the independent education system should absolutely trust that the Turnbull government's legislated model for school funding will put an additional $18.6 billion into schools across Australia. They should trust the fact that that funding will go at the fastest growth rate to the schools that need and deserve it the most, so that those around 4½ thousand Australian schools will receive a growth rate in excess of five per cent per student per annum over the decade into the future. This is strong growth for those schools that need it most. It is fair growth for all schools in Australia. It is about providing a model that actually is consistent, that reflects need, that gives additional support to students with disability, that gives additional support to Indigenous students and that gives additional support to rural and regional schools. It gives the support where it is needed most to the children who need it most.
