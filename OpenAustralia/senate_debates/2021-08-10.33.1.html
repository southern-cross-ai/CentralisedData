        Last week big, aggressive, foreign-owned, multinational corporation
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS" rel="nofollow">
         JBS
        </a>
        announced it is buying into Huon Aquaculture, diving into the troubled, divisive and controversial Tasmanian salmon industry. I and many Tasmanians—those who have fought against the past decade of crony capitalism in the state's salmon industry and fought for transparency, truth, robust and independent regulation in the industry—hold grave concerns over this. This takeover of Huon Aquaculture signals a new wave of industrialisation of our beloved waterways, oceans and beaches. The JBS Global
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        told media that the takeover of Huon is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …a strategic acquisition… Aquaculture will be a new growth platform for our businesses. We will repeat what we did previously with poultry, pork and value-added products to make our portfolio even more complete.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why am I and so many Tasmanians concerned? During its rapid rise to become the world's biggest meat packer, JBS and its network of subsidiaries have been linked to allegations of high-level corruption—including the biggest fine in corporate history, $3.2 billion, after bribing hundreds of politicians—modern day slave labour practices; illegal deforestation, particularly in the Amazon; animal welfare violations; major hygiene breaches and price fixing, including fines.
       </p>
       <p>
        I warn JBS that they won't be expanding in Tasmanian waterways without a fight, a significant community fight. I know JBS already exist in the beef industry in Tasmania. I know they have significant influence with government. I know many farmers have had dealings with JBS—some speak highly of the company. I say to JBS that this is an opportunity for you to put the industry on to a sustainable footprint—make sure we have an independent, robust, fully funded environmental protection agency. I ask them to support the Greens' bill to do this.
