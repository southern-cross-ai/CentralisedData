           has a long history of advocating for regional Queensland and understands firsthand the effect of crippling drought on our communities. As a regionally based senator and as a farmer, I know the harsh reality of drought not just on farmers but on all of those who live in affected communities, and it is really important that we remember how many of our communities are currently experiencing drought. Drought impacts community confidence and pride, and it does not discriminate. The economic and social impacts of drought can never be underestimated, and this government has a strong record of taking action on drought. Through the Drought Communities program this government is investing in projects that will help create jobs and stimulate growth. The program is providing $35 million to fund local infrastructure initiatives that provide employment for people whose work opportunities have been impacted by drought. To further support these impacted regions, identified local government areas will receive $1.5 million in funding to be targeted at projects that stimulate local community spending, use local resources, businesses and supplies and provide a long-lasting benefit to communities and the agricultural industries on which they depend. Since coming to government, we have invested more than $685 million in assistance and support for Australian farmers and rural communities experiencing drought and other hardship. We have seen over $413 million approved to 778 farm businesses and 5,767 claims for farm household allowance, with $1.35 million per week on average being distributed by the coalition government. This side of the chamber knows how important it is that we support those families and businesses during drought.

             would be very aware of the real outcomes this coalition government is delivering to drought affected areas in Queensland. Some 15 councils have had projects approved to help revitalise and stimulate the local economies across Queensland while generating confidence and growth. In Mckinlay shire, four projects to help boost tourism, including the refurbishment of a cultural centre, the expansion of the Julia Creek Caravan Park and upgrading amenities at the Kev Bannah Oval, have all been approved. The Blackall-Tambo Regional Council will receive funding to restore the Tambo sawmill, support a major upgrade of the historical cookhouse and refurbish the saleyards, and support land development at the Blackall racecourse complex. These are all very clear examples of the on-the-ground, real outcomes that this coalition is delivering for our drought affected communities.

               The government is investing in infrastructure initiatives to make travel quicker and easier while growing jobs and growth across regional Australia. This commitment includes the Roads to Recovery program, the Bridges Renewal program, the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity program, the

                Black Spot

               program and the National Highway Upgrade program. Under the Bridges Renewal program, the coalition government is supporting Queensland communities. For example, the Mckinlay Shire Council has received over $1.7 million to support work on the Punchbowl Road bridge. The

                Murweh Shire Council

               also receive coalition government support for work on the Nive River bridge and Langlo River bridge. These are all examples of the way the coalition government is supporting these communities in Queensland that are dealing with the very significant impacts of drought, and this coalition government will continue to support those communities.
