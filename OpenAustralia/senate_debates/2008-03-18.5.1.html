            Senator Crossin foolishly interjects. Having come from her absolute debacle about the

             Northern Territory
            </a>
            intervention, I would have thought she might have thought twice before opening her mouth, especially when she is not in her proper seat. That aside, the point is a very valid one. We as a government did not give that guarantee. That is quite right. But we were castigated from the

            to Tasmania, from Sydney to the Swan, for not being able to give that guarantee. The Labor Party went around the countryside saying, ‘You cannot vote for a government that is unable to give that guarantee.’

              The minister is still very rudely
              <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">
               interjecting

              . Today they are still unable to give that same guarantee that they demanded of the former government. I say to the Labor Party and to the minister: those good sound bites from the election campaign are a lot more difficult to turn into good, sound policy. The demands you made of the former government you now accept and realise you cannot live up to yourselves. Ms Gillard, in the other place, has been unable to give that guarantee. The minister at the table was unable to give that guarantee at Senate estimates. She was not willing to make the guarantee, which of course means that the Labor Party itself acknowledges that there will be workers worse off as a result of this legislation.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am giving the minister at the table the opportunity today to once and for all rule out that any worker will be worse off. If, as I suspect, she is unable to give that guarantee, she must have within her mind the category of workers that in fact will be worse off. She must have in her mind how many workers will be worse off and in what states she anticipates those workers will be in. Will they be mainly in the tourism industry or the resources sector? If she is unable to give that guarantee, she must realise that there will be some who will be worse off. So I ask the minister: can she give that guarantee and, if not, will she identify for us those who will be worse off?

               I can guarantee the chamber that we have legislation before us which will ensure far more protections for workers in this country than were ever put in place by the previous government. Protections were ripped away by Mr Howard’s cabinet apparently on the basis—as the member for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                North Sydney
               </a>
               says—of a lack of knowledge about what it was in fact doing. I do not know which is worse, a government that consciously removes conditions and wages from workers or a government that is not even aware it is doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
               Frankly, that was the usual churlish contribution from Senator
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abetz" rel="nofollow">
                Abetz
               </a>
               , a churlishness which was demonstrated by his withdrawal and comments in the debate which just preceded this. The way in which he chooses to behave at times really does belittle the chamber. It would have been appropriate, Senator Abetz, for you to have taken it on the chin and withdrawn when the President asked you to instead of making the sorts of comments that you did. But I will leave that to one side for now. If Senator Abetz chooses to behave like that, that is entirely a matter for him and his conscience.
              </p>
              <p>
               This government will deliver on our election commitments. We will do what we told the Australian people we would do. That is the substance of the bill before the chamber and I can guarantee, Senator Abetz, that the legislation this government will bring forward—unlike the legislation your government brought forward—will, firstly, be consistent and deliver upon our election commitments and, secondly, will restore the protections that your government either consciously or unwittingly stripped away from Australian workers and their families.
              </p>
              <p>
               I just want to remind the chamber—perhaps Senator Abetz does not realise this or perhaps he just got rolled in his party room—that the opposition is actually, as I understand it, not opposing this bill. They certainly did not oppose the second reading. Did any senators see the opposition oppose the second reading? I do not think so. After a number of weeks of toing and froing, with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition putting forward a range of different views about what was going to happen, the opposition has finally agreed not to oppose this bill.
              </p>
              <p>
               But there are those on the other side who cling to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
                Work Choices
               </a>
               like someone drowning, cling to what they see as a life raft. I am afraid Senator Abetz is one of those, because he cannot bear to see this piece of legislation that he fought so hard for through this place now being ripped up by this government in accordance with our election policies. That is what is happening here. We on this side of the chamber are absolutely clear that we will deliver on our election commitments. The bill before the chamber does that. I hope that what we see now is opposition senators delivering on the commitment of their leadership group to not oppose this bill.

               <p>
                Before I get to the same point, because I think it is an important area to be debated, I want to comment briefly, which I had not done, on
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
                 Senator Fielding
                </a>
                ’s second reading amendment. I must say in passing I am glad he did not turn up dressed as a pizza to put his amendment about meal breaks! I did note with interest the minister’s commentary in the second reading debate, on his second reading amendment. My opinion is that Senator Fielding is on the right track. What he has exposed and what the minister has identified is that there are gaps in this area which need to be explored. I think in due course the minister might do well to make some kind of announcement as to how that area will be dealt with in the future because meal breaks and so on are actually a very fundamental issue.
               </p>
               <p>
                Turning to the debate at hand—stripping away the rhetoric and aggression with which this particular debate has started—it is a very difficult area to work through. Whilst most people are sympathetic with the ideal of workers not losing wages and conditions, the fact is that when you reform, modernise or rationalise awards and agreements you have to change wages and conditions—usually conditions more than wages. It is one of the reasons that in 1996 the Democrats introduced the global no disadvantage test—because they recognised that, if you were creating an agreement, you could not match or meet up to the expectations of individual or specific wages and conditions and therefore you needed to assess the matter on balance overall.
               </p>
               <p>
                I do note that this is an area covered in the Greens’ additional remarks to the bill and I do note that Senator Siewert will be dealing with the specific issues of balance—how you balance out wages and conditions—later on in her amendments. My specific question, and it follows on from the specifics of Senator
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abetz" rel="nofollow">
                 Abetz
                </a>
                ’s question, is this. At paragraph 1.109 of the majority report, it said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                It was also noted that the process—
               </p>
               <p>
                this is, the process of award modernisation—
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                is not intended to ‘disadvantage employees’ or ‘increase costs for employers’. Yet it was pointed out that it is not possible to standardise conditions without disadvantaging someone. Witnesses urged the government to consider the language used and clarify its intent.

                These were remarks made by academics, by Professor Stewart and—I think my memory is correct—by Dr Buchanan, but it is a serious issue because this bill does initiate award modernisation and the request draft as outlined has these contradictory elements in it. It is a matter which I think does need to be resolved.
               </p>
               <p>
                What I would like is for the minister to answer, not in the sense of a general exposition but in the sense of process, as to what could be done to address this practical issue. Perhaps the draft request could be changed or the wording altered in the manner the academics have suggested to cater for two conflicting and irreconcilable objectives. Their proposition was that you cannot do both, and personally I think they had a valid point and I suspect the majority of the committee members also thought so.

                 Senator Murray, you are aware that the award modernisation request is in the explanatory memorandum—and the government has been transparent about that. I understand the point you are making. It seems to me that what the government is doing is requesting the commission to undertake a process. What you are asking is really one of the issues that the commission would grapple with and consider in terms of implementing the award modernisation process. I am sure you are aware that we had a very clear commitment to the modernisation of awards in our pre-election policies. The bill effects that commitment. I am advised that this would logically be one of the matters that the commission would consider in the context of the award modernisation process.

                  Perhaps I can assist with clarification. Minister, the problem that the academics in particular outlined—and which the committee took on board—is that the draft request to the commission for award modernisation seems to have two irreconcilable objectives, which I have outlined in picking up that particular paragraph in the report. It is their proposition that you cannot do both—you actually cannot do both of those things. Their view is that somebody, somewhere is going to have to suffer. I think that is a practical understanding. The academics suggested—and the chair of the committee is here and can assist us if necessary—a mechanism by which this could be resolved. My question really boils down to this: has the government understood that that is the problem—because of the evidence raised? Will you have a look at it and try to find a means of dealing with what are regarded as irreconcilable, competing objectives? Those objectives are that the process should not disadvantage employees or increase costs for employers. The academics made a clear case as to why it is impossible, in many cases, to do both.

                   Senator Murray, I appreciate the point you are making. I am not sure there is a simple answer, because this is a large task. I do not think the government has shied away from the fact that modernising awards is a significant task—hence the inclusion of this draft request in the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EM" rel="nofollow">
                    EM
                   </a>
                   which enables some of these issues to be discussed. If Senator Murray has a suggestion about how he would indicate a resolution of that at the outset of the process, I would certainly be interested in hearing it. It does seem to the government—as I indicated—that this is an issue that the commission will need to consider in this process, and will need to balance the various objects that are proposed in the request. Chair, I understand that government amendments have been circulated, so I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. I understand that the memorandum was circulated in the chamber today.

                    In summary, I will conclude my remarks in this way. The proposition put by the academics is that the commission will operate to the instructions provided in the legislation and its accompanying directions. The academics are indicating that you need to give the commission greater flexibility than is apparent in the way the directions are expressed at present. I would simply ask whether the minister would commit to examining the evidence provided to the inquiry on this issue, so that you can consider whether the directions to the tribunal need to be adjusted in any way.

                       and to the chamber, the proposition before the chamber is a set of legislation which restores the no disadvantage test for Australian workers as against the entirety of the award. It represents a much more beneficial industrial relations system than currently exists, and it provides for significantly more protection for workers and their families than under the previous government.

                         If the minister is offended by me calling her ‘her’, I withdraw that. I will give the minister a third go. They are very sensitive over there, and I think I know why. I would have thought it still quite parliamentary to refer to the minister in the third person, but, that all aside, I will give the minister a third go with the question: will any worker be worse off as a result of this legislation? Yes or no?

                         legislation you championed that legislation very strongly. I wonder now, in light of the evidence to date, whether you will concede that a great many Australians, particularly those with little bargaining power, were worse off as a result of the legislative framework you put in place. We on this side of the chamber are committed to restoring fairness to the workplace. That is what this legislation does, and it assures that the sort of stripping of pay and conditions in Australian workplace agreements that you saw under the previous government’s legislation cannot continue.

                          I think the record now shows quite clearly that the government are not able to give a guarantee that some Australian workers will not be worse off as a result of their legislation, a guarantee that they demanded from the former government. And, when it honestly said it was unable to give such a guarantee, the former government was pilloried from the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">

                          </a>
                          to Tasmania and from Sydney to the Swan for its inability to do so. Yet, a few months later, we have this new Rudd Labor government, with all the gloss coming off and with all the cliches that they used during the campaign that no worker should be worse off, now admitting that their legislation will see some workers worse off.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I ask the minister: why has it taken the government so long to bring in this legislation, keeping in mind that the Prime Minister, on 18 November, six days before the election, promised that the parliament would resume before Christmas? We know that that is already a broken election promise, because he did not resume the parliament before Christmas. Indeed, the parliament resumed on 12 February, the latest day that the parliament has resumed this century and this millennium. I ask: given that delay, given that huge amount of time that the Labor government had to get its house in order, why, some 10 minutes ago, did they drop on us 10 pages comprising 24 separate amendments to their proposed legislation, with an explanatory memorandum that goes for 15 pages? I recall Senator Wong was highly critical when the former government behaved in such a manner.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We were told that that was the sign of a government in decay, a government that was arrogant and a government that was doing legislation on the run. I would be interested in whether, after less than 120 days in office, this is indicative of the Rudd government now being a government in decay and displaying signs of arrogance. Also, why has it taken so long for this legislation to come into the chamber and why has there been the delay in presenting us with these very detailed and lengthy amendments?

                             , I was there and I can tell you there were significantly more amendments in volume and certainly in scope than the government has moved now. These are primarily technical amendments. We are very happy to take the Senate through them.

                             Regarding the comments Senator Abetz makes about time lines, I would suggest to him that there might be just a touch of overreach in his contribution to the chamber at the moment. To suggest that we have delayed the legislation when this was the first bill introduced into this parliament by the new Rudd Labor government is really going a bridge too far. As I said, we are very happy to go through the technical amendments we have introduced, and I am sure senators would rightly request that of the government if they were unclear as to the scope of the amendments.

                                   s will continue up to and past their nominal expiry date until terminated or replaced. I made two points about that. Firstly, this is a transitional provision and, secondly, the government, when in opposition, did lay out this in detail in our election policy. Both of our policies, as you will recall, were released well prior to the election and were substantively litigated.

                                          I thank the minister for that clarification. The difficulty that we have on this side, Minister, is that the Prime Minister promised to recall the parliament before Christmas and did not. So just because there is an election policy does not mean that it necessarily translates into the legislation that is before us. What this now highlights is that

                                          s—those obscene, nasty agreements that were a blot on the industrial landscape!—are now, under Labor’s own legislation, going to be allowed to continue indefinitely. I would have thought social justice and all those other terms that the Labor Party bandied about during the election campaign would have demanded that AWAs be abolished, got rid of holus-bolus because of all these terrible sins that they committed—how they ripped workers off. Labor is now saying that all those AWAs, even the AWAs being made today, I assume, can continue indefinitely, irrespective of what Labor may have said about AWAs in the past.

                                           On the same point, it is a standard, indeed basic, legal principle of courts and governments not to seek to overturn contracts between parties by fiat. They will do so by agreement. Sometimes that is unfortunate, but that has always been, as I understand it, a basic legal principle. An important part of what you read out earlier, Minister, the policy which this government holds to, is providing that the continuation of those contracts is with the agreement of both the employee and the employer. My question is: how will you know whether an employee, for instance, might have been placed under duress in signing on to the original agreement and might in fact want out of it but cannot? Is there any mechanism for someone with a genuine grievance, who felt pushed into it originally, if you like, and wants out of it in the future? Will there be any mechanism for them to take that matter up in some tribunal or some dispute mechanism?

I would also point out the second part of what I read out, which does enable, post the nominal expiry date, one party—that is, in the example you are raising, an employee—to provide 90 days notice to the other party after the nominal expiry date in order for the agreement to be terminated. So there are two termination routes which are envisaged by our policy and, I am advised, are picked up in the various provisions in the legislation.

                                             This is the point, and I will come to it later during the debate. This is why we the Greens have in fact put an amendment up that says that

I am sorry, but I do not think the mechanisms that are in place sufficiently deal with the issue of duress in a workplace if an employee wants to get out of their AWA but feels sufficient duress. I think the degree of that is debatable, but I also ask—and to a certain extent, for once, I agree with the opposition—

                                                , if you are agreeing with the Greens—not that I have a problem with that per se—it probably indicates, if you are a coalition senator, that you might be being a little bit opportunistic. There are two points I would make, Senator Siewert. The first is a technical point, and I will make sure I get this right. If by legislative fiat you simply mandated the termination of agreements as at a nominal expiry date, you could in fact have a reduction in conditions for employees, and the point is that we wanted an appropriate transition arrangement. Hence the transition arrangements that I have read out.

                                                The second point I make is really a mandate issue. I appreciate the position that you are putting, but what we are putting now is absolutely consistent with the election commitment that was made.

I assume that there is a point to this question that is relevant to the debate on the bill.

                                                     We would move along a lot quicker if the honourable minister would desist from trying to question motives. It was her own Labor Senate colleagues, on page 2 of their report—so it seems the minister did not even get to page 2 of the Senate committee report that her own colleagues wrote—who told us that the current regime of workplace relations ‘resulted in the most complex and highly regulated industrial system of any

Very tellingly, there was no footnote in the report, and that is why I wanted to see what the veracity of that comment by Labor senators was, because it is a general issue relating to this bill. It clearly is relevant because, if it were not relevant, I am sure Labor senators would not have included it in their report.

                                                        I think your point about complexity is probably demonstrated by what we are talking about. There are three volumes of legislation, as you know—two of the substantive bill and one of the regulations—which currently comprise what your government did to industrial relations. So if you want to talk about complexity, it can be weighed in terms of what your government actually did. Your question related to employment impacts; is that right, Senator

We have in mind a system predicated on collective bargaining over the safety net. We have made very clear our views about the importance of driving productivity, of productivity being the incentive for wage increases. As the senator would know, today’s productivity is tomorrow’s prosperity, and that is very much the approach the government is taking.

                                                           Once again I am not provided with an answer. But I am quite thrilled that the minister pulled the stunt of pulling out all the legislation. I recall coming into this place when on the other side with a ream of paper that represented one single industrial award. So, when we talk about a complicated system, if we were to stack the awards on top of each other we would undoubtedly exceed the height of the flagpole on top of this place. Three meagre volumes disappear into insignificance by comparison. But I have a question, seeing we are not getting any answers, which highlights the fact that the glib one-liners run during the election campaign are not able to be delivered on for the Australian people. I recall when doing

                                                           , the Labor Party—and I thought to a certain extent they may have had a good point here—asked whether any economic modelling had been done to support such wild assertions as, if I recall, if the legislation was passed we might in fact get an increase in employment of 70,000-plus people and we might be able to break the psychological figure of a five per cent unemployment rate! Today we celebrate an unemployment rate of 3.97 per cent, which is a great outcome for those thousands of Australian workers who are in fact now able to be described as working families; previously they would have been welfare families. Having mentioned that, I ask: has the government done any economic modelling in relation to its proposed changes and, if not, why did it demand economic modelling of the previous government when it itself is not undertaking economic modelling for its changes? Is it that one rule applies to the Liberal Party and the National Party and another one to the Labor Party?

The opposition put in place the most unfair laws this country has ever seen—laws which removed wages and conditions from a great many working families in this country, laws which stripped away conditions in the sorts of percentages that I read out earlier. They are now coming in here—I am not actually sure what their line is because the opposition, as it is wont to do, is all over the place. On the one hand we are being criticised from the right; on the other hand, bizarrely for Senator

This is an opposition which, when in government, put in place a set of laws for which it did not have a mandate. Senator Abetz, I do not recall you going around Tasmania telling families in Tasmania that you were going to champion laws that were going to enable their penalty rates and their overtime rates to be removed. I do not recall you putting out a press release prior to the 2004 election telling them. Perhaps you would like to disabuse me if I am incorrect on that.

                                                            The government have made it clear that we predicate the approach we have taken on the experience of the productivity increases during the period this country did move to enterprise bargaining. We have proposed a new fair and flexible workplace system which is firmly focused on lifting productivity. If productivity improves in an enterprise then there are gains to be shared. That is the approach we will be taking. The workplace relations system the Rudd government will introduce is a decentralised system where employers and employees bargain at the individual enterprise level. We have been very clear about our focus on productivity. We have also been clear about what we regard as an important priority, and that is modernising awards. We are implementing our election policy commitments on this front.
                                                           </p>

                                                            In terms of the effect of our policy, which the shadow minister seems to care about so much, I would like to emphasise to the chamber that these issues being discussed now were discussed quite a lot, you would have to say, in the period leading up to the election. I do not think anyone in this country—unless you really did not read any newspapers or watch any television or talk to very many people—could possibly have thought that industrial relations was not an issue. It was a significant topic at the last election. A great many of the assertions that Senator Abetz is putting forward are the very same arguments that the previous government sought to put against the Labor Party in the previous election and he is continuing to do so in this chamber on a bill that he is charged with handling that, as I understand, his deputy leader and leader have instructed him to support.

I have not quite understood—this is clearly coalition party speak—what the difference between ‘not oppose’ and ‘support’ is in a chamber where you actually have to vote at some point, unless perhaps they are just going to keep silent for the entirety of the voting period and only make contributions during the debate. Senator Abetz, we have a bill before the chamber which delivers on this government’s election commitments in a policy area that was, absolutely, a significant focus of the last election. From this side of the chamber we would like to proceed with debating the various amendments, including those from the crossbenches as well as government amendments, which I am happy to provide detail of.

Instead of the torrent of abuse, the minister could have said either yes or no to that question. But of course she could not and did not because she did not want to tell the Australian people that that which she had demanded from the previous government they themselves are not doing.

This minister does not answer questions, but it is important to get on the record what the responses are. Given that she was able to advise us how many Australian workplace agreements removed overtime pay, penalty rates, annual leave loading and rest breaks, is she able to advise us how many awards and collective agreements have removed overtime pay, penalty rates, annual leave loading and rest breaks? And let her deny that awards have not removed those conditions.

I ask the minister: in the event that the original bill was clearly election policy and all clear, why is it that she had to come in here half an hour ago, tail between her legs, with 24 government amendments and 15 pages of explanatory memorandum if it was all so simple? If it was all so simple, why is it that she has now had to come in with all these amendments?

The second point I wanted to make to Senator Abetz in his attempt—and this is not a new game by the senator—to suggest that there was somehow some equivalence between collective agreements and Australian workplace agreements that were imposed by and put in place by his government, is that if he is concerned about wages and conditions such as penalty rates being traded off, as he appears to be suggesting, one wonders why he supported

I would make the point therefore that he should support the bill because the bill introduces a no disadvantage test against the full award which would include conditions such as penalty rates. Senator Abetz, I apologise; I have forgotten what your third question was. There were two or three, I think.

That was the question. Do not try to squib out of it by saying that some economic information was provided. The specific question was: was economic modelling undertaken? And I trust that it was not the department that provided you with that previous answer.

In terms of economic information, there is a substantial amount contained in the department’s submission and I draw the senator’s attention to it. I am not sure I can assist him any further on this.

I trust, or can I assume, that that answer remains the same, or was economic modelling undertaken between 11 March and Tuesday, 18 March—in the last seven days?

I remind Senator Fisher that, as I am advised—and I will check these figures—around 57,000 agreements entered the backlog between your government’s announcement of your so-called fairness test and the legislation being passed through the parliament. If anyone on that side of the chamber wants to talk about backlogs, they ought to be very careful. I will get advice on this issue, if you wish. I am not aware of the comments to which you have referred, but if I am able to provide you with any further information I will.

I will get some further information when I read that. Please give me a minute. Was the question in relation to this legislation? Otherwise, I am sure that Senator Fisher can ask this question in question time, which is rapidly approaching. I am advised that most agreements start on approval under this bill, so no back pay issue arises. Agreements have to be signed when lodged. We make the point that the no disadvantage test that is introduced with this legislation is significantly simpler than the so-called fairness test.

I have already given the senator, in an effort to assist her, an indication of what aspects of this bill attempt to deal with the appropriate processing of agreements. I am not sure that I can assist her any further.

You could at least try and disguise it a little better, if I may suggest. The government has made its position in relation to Fair Work Australia and the consequences associated with establishing that clear. That is in our policy commitments. We are keen to proceed in relation to this bill, implementing as it does a promise to the Australian people prior to the last election.

I am one of those who do not like the ‘get out of the way’ kind of rhetoric which says that the opposition should not pursue matters of accountability. But it is an irritant, frankly, when we have a tight timetable and senators who were not present when matters were fully explored in general questions ask about those same matters. My point of order is that it is tedious repetition. From my memory, about 10 to 15 minutes were devoted to that exact question prior to this.

I will give her one last question in the general question area: given her repeated statement that this legislation implements Labor’s election promises, pure and simple, can she remind the Senate—and, indeed, the Australian people—when, during that election campaign and long debate about the proposed changes, she or anybody else from the

The bill before the chamber delivers on the government’s election commitments and we would like to proceed to vote on it. Senator Murray, I accept your point: I think oppositions and crossbenchers are absolutely entitled to probe legislation. The point we have made is we have an opposition which says it does not oppose this legislation and which, to my reading—and I was just checking again the Senate report—has not, in fact, proposed any amendments. That is the context of this: it is not a constructive discussion about accountability in this chamber; the opposition are seeking to play out a political process on a bill that they said they are not going to oppose. I was simply making that point, but I take the point you are making.

What we did was listen to the Australian people; we listened to the fact that there was clear evidence—despite the then government’s best efforts to hide it—of Australian workplace agreements removing substantive rights such as penalty rates. This argument really is rich from an opposition that, when in government, promised conditions such as penalty rates and overtime would be protected by law but then allowed these conditions to be stripped away without any compensation. This line of argument is rich coming from a party that said workers would be protected by a so-called fairness test but then designed a test which did not provide full compensation for loss of important award conditions like overtime and had no protection for key award conditions such as redundancy.

Minister, the minimum wage is not just a current topic in the media; it was raised as an issue during the committee inquiry by a number of witnesses, including the very longstanding senior union official Joe de Bruyn of the shoppies union. He essentially raised—and other witnesses commented on this—the concern that a minimum wage might not cover all Australian employees. So I had a look at subdivision (g) of the relevant section of the act, which covers federal minimum wages. Minister, I will not be asking you to respond to a specific question—I am going to be asking you to take a question on notice—but I need to describe the issue to you so that you understand what concerns Joe de Bruyn and others have and that they need a response from the government.

Minister, can you take these questions on notice. Could you get departmental advice as to whether there are any Australian employees to whom a minimum wage does not apply? If that is the case, does the government propose to review that matter when it is looking at the substantive bill later this year?

Proposed section 326 currently prevents an employer making an ITEA with a former employee. I am advised that the bill was originally drafted in this way because the government was concerned that employers would arrange for the employment of employees to be terminated in order for them to sign up to ITEAs.

The government considers that the amendment gives employers and industries with high turnover and a limited pool of employees the flexibility that they need during the transition period whilst ensuring ITEAs are confined to limited use.

It is very interesting to observe that in circumstances where Senator Wong has been saying, ‘This legislation puts down our election commitments, pure and simple,’ the very first amendment that the Rudd Labor government has to move to its industrial relations legislation is in fact an amendment to broaden the coverage of these new—for want of a better term—Australian workplace agreements. They started off as narrow as possible, but reality finally mugged them. They came creeping in here only an hour ago with a raft of two dozen amendments and 15 pages of explanatory memorandum. The very first thing they do is expand the coverage of these now interim workplace agreements.
                                                                                                                 </p>

We hope—and this is why we as an opposition are supporting it—this will reduce the negative impact on Australian workers. The minister refused, time and again during general questioning, to give a guarantee that no worker would be worse off as a result of this legislation. It is now quite clear that many workers will be worse off as a result of Labor’s proposed legislation, but its very first amendment will ensure that that negative impact is in fact lessened. It is on that basis that we as the opposition support the amendment.
