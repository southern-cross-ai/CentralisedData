        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Can the minister confirm that converting an existing

         The project that the Commonwealth has been fortunate enough to be able to announce, which provides $35 million to bring new fuel savings technologies to Australia, is about creating jobs and tackling climate change. It is a project which, I think, is far too good to miss. It is a project which will secure the production of 10,000 hybrid Camrys per annum and is in addition to Toyota’s existing production of conventional Camrys and Aurions. It will stimulate the development of new production and after-market capabilities. It will get Australia into the green vehicle game, which, until now, we have been watching very much from the sidelines. It will generate hundreds of jobs and cement Australia’s place in Toyota’s global production system. It will encourage a competitive response from other Australian automotive manufacturers who are working on green technologies of their own. The money will be invested in research and development, in retooling and in plant and equipment to produce the hybrid. The Australian government has made it very clear that there are a whole series of benchmarks to be met.
        </p>
        <p>
         I wanted to make those points because it is quite clear from the opposition’s response to this initiative that they are quite confused. On the one hand, Senator Minchin appears to support the Australian automotive industry and, on the other hand, Senator Abetz has been nothing but hostile. In fact, he has a visceral contempt for the Australian automotive industry. He has demonstrated time and time again his lack of understanding of the significance of the Australian automotive industry. So what we have here is quite clearly confusion on behalf of the coalition.

            Claims have been made that this is a project that the opposition does support—that is what Dr Nelson has said—but then we have claims made by senators here that they do not support this project. So which one is it? Do you support this project or don’t you? I think we need a clear statement from you.

                   Order! We will not continue until the Senate comes to order. Senator Kemp, you will be aware that I cannot direct the minister on how to answer a question; I can only further remind him of the question that was asked.

                    . The government’s modelling suggests that savings of some $300-odd a year can be made from an

                    conversion, but savings of up to $1,000 can be found if you are an average motorist driving the hybrid Camry about 20,000 kilometres a year. There are substantial savings in fuel consumption to be had from the hybrid Camry.

                     , I ask a supplementary question of the minister. Is it also a fact that the cost of converting a
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Camry" rel="nofollow">
                      Toyota Camry

                     </a>
                     is far less than the likely cost premium for a new hybrid Camry? Doesn’t this just prove that Labor Senator George Campbell—who, I notice, is not in the chamber at the moment—was correct when he described the government’s $35 million gift to Toyota as a ‘pig in a poke’?

                      As I have indicated, there are a range of strategies that the government is pursuing, because our commitment is to reduce the cost of running a car for average motorists. Our commitment, our drive, is to ensure that we take the pressure not only off motorists’ wallets but also off the environment. Our approach is to ensure that these things happen quickly. Alternatively, the former government had 11 years to do something about these issues and, for 11 years, it denied the existence of climate change as a serious issue, denied the science and were sceptics about the whole issue of climate change. Now we have the situation where the opposition wishes to deny an opportunity such as the one which presents itself. According to the opposition, we should have said to Toyota: ‘No thanks. Come back when you’ve got a car good enough for our leading authorities on vehicle technology’—the
