        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Senator Murray Watt. Is the government aware that Australians are being exposed, on their social media feeds, to illegal advertisements from online casinos?

         Thank you, Senator Pocock. Obviously, you didn't get the memo that all the questions were supposed to go to Senator Farrell this week! But I'm happy to have an attempt at this. I have heard the media reporting about this issue this morning. I'll attempt to get some more information on this point for you during question time. But I do think that all Australians are concerned about the growing proliferation of gambling advertising on online platforms. There are of course particular concerns when it comes to the risk around those advertisements being accessed by children. As a parent myself I know I'm pretty disturbed about the amount of online advertising that goes on around gambling, which can clearly be accessed by children, if it is not in fact targeting children. Of course, there are additional concerns about the risk of online gambling advertisements to the adult population as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is something that needs closer exploration to make sure that our regulatory systems are adequate to the task, and this is something that I know Minister Rowland takes very seriously. She has already commenced work on a range of fronts when it comes to online advertising, particularly in relation to gambling, and that's something that our entire government supports because we do want to make sure that the regulatory settings that we have in place for online advertising are suitable. This is obviously a fast-evolving field. It's one of those areas where, the minute governments intervene and create a regulatory environment, new operators come on board and find loopholes, and it's something that we do always need to review.
        </p>
        <p>
         More generally, when it comes to gambling advertising, I can assure you that the Albanese government recognises the importance of gambling promotions being presented in a responsible manner. We also recognise that there is ongoing community concern about the harms associated with online gambling, including advertising material. I think that it is timely for parliament to consider what more should be done to address this issue, and, Senator Pocock, I look forward to working with you on that.

            (â€”) (): Thanks again, Senator Pocock. As I say, the Albanese government does recognise there is ongoing community concern about harms associated with online gambling, and that's exactly why we have established an inquiry into online gambling and its impacts on those experiencing gambling harm. That inquiry is being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Policy" rel="nofollow">
             Social Policy
            </a>
            and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
             Legal Affairs
            </a>
            . If I'm not mistaken, that's being chaired by Peta Murphy, one of our outstanding members in the House of Representatives, and I've seen some of the media coverage that she has obtained in talking about this important issue. This committee is considering the effectiveness of current gambling advertising restrictions on limiting children's exposure to gambling products and services, including through social media, sponsorship or branding, among a range of other issues. Senator Pocock, you're asking what the government intends to do about it. I guess the first step is to consider the committee's recommendations when it releases its final report. I can assure you they will be properly considered.

               It would obviously be premature for me or anyone from the government to comment on what we will do in response to that inquiry and its recommendations, but I acknowledge the issues that you've raised about the jurisdiction of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
                ACMA
               </a>
               . If that is something that the committee finds is something that needs some changes made, then, of course, we would do that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Senator Pocock, I'm not sure what engagement you've had with the inquiry up to this point, but you, like every member of the public, are entitled to make a submission to that inquiry. I would certainly encourage you to do so, if you haven't already. We do think this is a really important issue. We want to hear from a broad range of the Australian public about how we can best address it. As I say, should the inquiry recommend that we make the type of changes that you're talking about in relation to ACMA, then I'm sure that we would listen very closely to that.
