        3754, Adye Glen Rockliff. The death notice read as follows:

        … the widows, children, grandchildren and friends of Adye's commrades from C-Company of 2nd/3rd Machine Gun Battalion extend our deepest sympathy to his family.

        1941, the battalion embarked for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East

       <p>
        Following Japan's entry into the war, Australian troops from the Middle East were transferred to the Pacific region. In early 1942, the Japanese advanced through the

         Netherlands East Indies
        </a>
        . Four days after the fall of Singapore, and on the day Darwin was bombed, Australian troops disembarked in Java from the troopship
        <i>

        </i>
        , having been diverted on their return journey to Australia. Adye's unit was joined by the 2nd/2nd Pioneer Battalion and the 2nd/2nd
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_Clearing_Station" rel="nofollow">
         Casualty Clearing Station
        </a>
        , which had served at Tobruk. The clearing station included the much renowned surgeon Edward 'Weary' Dunlop, a man whom I had the privilege of meeting. These units and others already on the island became known as Black Force.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the night of 28 February, when the Japanese began landing, Tasmania C Company was at the forefront of the action. It resulted in the loss of seven members killed and 28 wounded, but afterwards they found that they had killed no fewer than 200 Japanese. However, Black Force was ordered to surrender on 9 March, following the Dutch capitulation the day before. Members of Black Force unit spent captivity in a wide range of locations, including Thailand, Japan and Singapore. One hundred and thirty-nine from the 2nd/3rd

        Battalion died as prisoners. Adye and other Tasmanians moved to a prisoner-of-war camp and came under the command of Lieutenant Colonel
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weary_Dunlop" rel="nofollow">
         Weary Dunlop
        </a>
        . They were then transferred to Changi, in Singapore, and then the Burma-Thailand railway. Nine thousand five hundred Australians worked on this railway, where 2,646 died from the deprivations, the effects of tropical diseases and malnutrition. This was despite the heroic efforts of doctors and officers like Weary Dunlop.
       </p>
       <p>
        After 18 months of this brutal existence, Adye and some of his unit were selected to work in Japan in undersea coalmines. His convoy of 14 transport ships suffered bad weather and attacks by allied submarines, meaning only four ships reached Japan. Twenty-seven members of his machine gun battalion died on one of those sunken ships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rockliff survived in the coalmine until the end of the war. He returned to Tasmania after six years at war and immediately found it difficult to reacclimatise to normal life, no longer fighting to survive each day or dealing with life-or-death issues. He found Australia had changed. His brothers and sisters had grown. And he felt the loss of being part of a large organisation such as the Army. Like his prisoner-of-war camp commander Weary Dunlop, after the war Adye became an advocate for his returned comrades, often battling the department for medical and social assistance for fellow mates. In recent years, he took the opportunity to write to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and also to write a book on his wartime experience, entitled simply

        Adye Glen Rockliff's sacrifice in war for his family and his country was typical of many Australians who served in

         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . His battles with the

         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        remind us of the importance of getting the right response by government to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission's review of veterans' entitlements. His life reminds us of the importance of Australian values mateship, loyalty and courage in the face of adversity and that there are virtues, values and principles which are worthy of sacrifice. His sacrifice and that of his fellow veterans was acknowledged by the Prime Minister in his recent visit to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellfire_Pass" rel="nofollow">
         Hellfire Pass
        </a>
        and the memorial to our prisoners of war that were on the Burma Thailand Railway. The memorial, I had the honour of visiting—and, indeed, of hearing, as I walked around, the reminiscences of former Labor minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Uren" rel="nofollow">

        , both of whom continued their service, after the war, in this parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is appropriate on days such as this to reflect that our privilege to serve in this place was bought with the blood and lives of our forebears and continues to be protected today by similarly minded individuals in our ADF. In my home state, we have seen the Headstone Project in Tasmania mark the final resting place of World War I veterans who previously lay in unmarked graves. It is right and proper to continue the tradition of acknowledging the sacrifices of our diggers on Remembrance Day and to offer our deep heartfelt thanks to all those who served in any war or conflict. Lest we forget.
