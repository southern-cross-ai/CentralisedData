             I thank Senator Sterle for his question. The government announced yesterday that it would progress significant public policy reforms. As the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

             is rolled out, Telstra will no longer be a vertically integrated owner of a fixed line network. In light of this transition to a new industry structure, we need a new universal service framework to improve protections of essential communication services. Therefore, a new entity,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USO" rel="nofollow">
              USO
             </a>
             Co., will take responsibility for the delivery of the universal service obligation. From July 2012 USO Co. will assume responsibility for most of Telstra’s universal service obligations: for the delivery of the standard telephone services, payphones and emergency call handling. For the first time, the Commonwealth will provide funding to support the delivery of the USO. This funding will build to $100 million per year by 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
             This approach has been endorsed by industry.

              Rosemary Sinclair
             </a>
             of the Australian Telecommunications Users Group said establishing USO Co. with explicit funding as an independent organisation is ‘a better approach’. The general manager of iiNet’s regulatory affairs, Steve Dalby, described it as ‘very positive for the industry’. The government will also provide $100 million to assist with retraining and redeployment of Telstra staff that will be affected by this historic transition from the copper age to the fibre future. As

               Under an arrangement announced yesterday, Australians will have the security of knowing that they will continue to have dependable access to a standard telephone service and that control over the removal of payphones and management of emergency call services and the National Relay Service will be the responsibility of an entity formed entirely to deliver these public services. Of course, the government is also committed to strengthening universal service obligations and has introduced legislation to that effect. Once again, by opposing this legislation for the sake of opposing, the opposition are putting politics ahead of consumers in this country—those same consumers they sold down the river through their ill-designed privatisation of a virtual monopolist in rural and regional areas.

                 Those opposite have had the opportunity to look at this policy. They have had the opportunity to look at this historic reform that has been put in place—a reform that was beyond those opposite, a reform that they were not able to deliver in 11½ years. There were 18 failed broadband plans. Australia’s broadband system was a joke internationally and those opposite seek to take us—
