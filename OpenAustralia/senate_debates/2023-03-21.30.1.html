        Often domestic problems, as we know, require global action to tackle. Australians supporting overseas orphanages is one of those issues. Last week in Bahrain MPs from 178 countries gathered to deliberate, exchange views and take action on key global issues. Last year, I was appointed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">
         IPU
        </a>
        as a rapporteur on orphanage trafficking. And last week in Bahrain I was successful in obtaining IPU support for parliamentary action globally on this despicable form of trafficking and child exploitation. Twenty-nine countries spoke in favour of Australia bringing forward a draft resolution for global action at the next IPU congress to be held in Angola this October. We will also be preparing a guidebook for MPs globally to take action on how to stop their citizens inadvertently supporting this evil trade in children. At the heart of this handbook will be how to implement the three Ps of dealing with trafficking—that is: protection, prosecution and prevention. And now there's a fourth one with global action and that is with international partnerships.

        I welcome the IPU's appointment of co-rapporteur Dr Ernesto Bustamante, a Peruvian MP. And I sincerely thank him for working with the IPU and myself on tackling this problem. But also a huge shout-out and thanks to the other Australian delegates who have been so supportive: the Speaker; Mr Warren Entsch; Dr Gordon Reid; and, of course, my colleague Senator Payman, who has been such a great help on this issue, and I thank you for that. A final thanks to departmental staff Jane Thomson and Aleshia Westgate, who tirelessly worked to get this great outcome and take it to the next step.
