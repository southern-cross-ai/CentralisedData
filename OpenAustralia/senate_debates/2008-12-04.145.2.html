        Improving water security for our towns and cities is a high priority for the Australian Government. The Australian Government’s new national plan, ‘Water for the Future’ provides a single, coherent national framework that integrates rural and urban water issues and secures the long term water supply of all Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ‘Water for the Future’ is built on four key priorities, namely taking action on climate change, using water wisely, securing water supplies and supporting healthy rivers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In delivering ‘Water for the Future’ the Australian Government will be seeking to set a new standard in national leadership and co-operative relations with all levels of government. Commonwealth funding will be tied to reform.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To help secure water supplies for the current and future needs of our towns and cities, the Australian Government has committed $1.5 billion in new urban water investment to deliver on the key priorities of using water wisely and securing new water supplies.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The National Urban Water and Desalination Plan will provide funding and tax offsets for innovative water supply projects in desalination, water recycling and major stormwater capture.

        <li>
         The National Water Security Plan for Cities and Towns will target infrastructure refurbishment, new infrastructure and practical projects that save water and reduce water losses.

        , there is significant investment in infrastructure occurring to meet the needs of a growing population while dealing with the uncertainties associated with climate change. New approaches need to evolve so that markets can operate more effectively to allocate water between competing uses, improve water use efficiency and deliver water to its highest value uses. Economic settings should promote affordable and timely investment in secure water supplies and water-efficient technologies that reward customers for their water conservation efforts. Improved water security in remote communities, including remote indigenous communities, will confirm Australian’s basic rights to drinking water. Finally, by ensuring water planners have the best available information on available water resources and the likely impacts of climate change, problems of poor planning, over-allocation and under-investment are avoided and the likelihood of costly water shortages into the future is minimised.

        The objectives of the EPBC Act include the protection of the environment, especially matters of NES, and to promote ecologically sustainable development. In order to achieve these objectives the EPBC Act provides an efficient and effective national environmental assessment and approvals process.

       <p class="italic">
        Under the EPBC Act an action will require approval if the action has, will have, or is likely to have, a significant impact on a matter of NES. This applies to a number of Queensland Government water supply initiatives that were discussed as part of the Senate Inquiry, including the proposed dams at Traveston Crossing and Wyaralong.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 29 November 2006, it was determined that the proposal to build the Traveston Crossing Dam would require assessment and approval under the EPBC Act. The matters of NES that will be the focus of this assessment include World Heritage places, wetlands of international importance, nationally threatened species and ecological communities, and migratory species listed under international agreements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The assessment of the Traveston Crossing Dam under the EPBC Act is being undertaken in accordance with the bilateral agreement between the Australian and Queensland Governments. This bilateral agreement requires that the assessment undertaken by the Queensland Government consider the impacts of the action on matters of NES.
       </p>

        The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIS" rel="nofollow">
         EIS
        </a>
        ) for the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam was released on 18 October 2007, and was made available for public comment until 14 January 2008. As part of the Bilateral assessment process the company proposing to take the action, Queensland Water Infrastructure Pty Ltd (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWI" rel="nofollow">
         QWI
        </a>
        ), is required to address relevant issues raised in public submissions on the Draft EIS. The public comment period provides an opportunity for all members of the community to contribute their opinion, expertise or advice to the assessment of the proposal nominated by the proponent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following a rigorous assessment process the Minister will make his decision on whether or not to approve the Traveston Crossing Dam under the EPBC Act. As required by the Act, the Minister will consider both environmental matters associated with the relevant matters of NES as well as economic and social matters. The information to be considered by the Minister in making his decision will include, but not be limited to, that contained within the EIS, the public submissions made on the EIS, the proponent’s response to those submissions, and relevant findings of the Senate Inquiry. If the Minister is not satisfied that he has enough information to make an informed decision, he can seek further information before making a decision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The results of the compliance audit of the Paradise Dam approval conditions will be taken into account, as relevant, to assess mitigation options and inform relevant approval conditions for Traveston Crossing Dam, should the Minister decide to approve the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam under the EPBC Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 13 December 2006, it was determined that the proposal to build Wyaralong Dam would similarly require assessment and approval under the EPBC Act in accordance with the bilateral agreement between the Australian and Queensland Governments. The relevant matters of NES for this proposal include wetlands of international importance, nationally threatened species and ecological communities, and migratory species listed under international agreements. The Draft EIS for the proposed Wyaralong Dam was released on 7 November 2007, and was made available for public comment until 12 December 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 24 November 2008, the construction of the Wyaralong Dam was approved with conditions attached. It was determined that with the approval conditions in place, the proposal could proceed while still ensuring the protection of the relevant matters of national environmental significance in accordance with the requirements of the EPBC Act.

       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Instigate strategies that will inform, engage and consult with members of the affected communities;

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The evidence given to the Inquiry by so many witnesses from a wide range of professional, community, social and economic backgrounds leaves us with very strong doubt that, either the Traveston Crossing Dam, or the Wyaralong Dam will be particularly useful exercises in contributing to the solution of the long term water needs for the growing south-east region of Queensland. The proposal to construct these dams suggests to us that the decision to build them was politically motivated and reached without sufficient scientific, social or economic analysis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Improving water security for our towns and cities is a high priority for the Australian Government.

         The Government

        supports initiatives that will drive investment in diverse water supply options and encourage industry and the community to save and use water more efficiently. While the Australian Government is working cooperatively with the states and territories to address water issues, such issues are planning matters for the state, subject to certain approvals required under the EPBC Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Queensland Government has identified Traveston Crossing and Wyaralong as preferred locations for surface water supply dams. QWI referred both the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam and Wyaralong Dam to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts for assessment under the EPBC Act. As noted in response to Recommendation 1 above, in deciding whether or not to approve an action the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts must consider the relevant information on the potential impacts of the proposal nominated by the proponent on matters of National Environmental Significance, and economic and social matters.

       <p class="italic">
        We thank the Queensland public servants for their assistance and willingness to give evidence to the Inquiry. They have found themselves in a difficult position having had to justify publicly and before a parliamentary committee, elements of a policy with which they were plainly uncomfortable. In all they acted responsibly and professionally and were a credit to the public service system they serve. Yet none of this overcomes what appeared to us an exercise in trying to defend the indefensible.

        With regard to the Traveston Crossing Dam, the cost in financial, economic, environmental and social terms of stages one and two of the dam will dwarf any intended benefit to residents of

       <p class="italic">
        All decisions on whether to approve an action made under the EPBC Act require consideration of economic and social matters in addition to matters of national environmental significance. This is to ensure these important matters are taken into consideration before making a final decision.

        Considering the evidence provided to the Committee we have a very real concern that Australian native fauna which is unique to the Mary River system will be in serious danger of extinction if the dam proceeds. The evidence along these lines appears to be overwhelming and very persuasive.

        Our conclusions on the Traveston Crossing Dam are reinforced by the actions of the Queensland Government. In dealing with the people of the Mary River Valley, the experts engaged by them and the volunteers supporting them, the government has been frequently evasive and inattentive to their desire for information on the dam.

        At the completion of the Inquiry we have been left with the very firm conclusion that the Traveston Crossing Dam in particular, is a political response to a serious problem, but is not one which will solve the problem.

        We believe there are many other possible solutions to Southeast Queensland's obvious needs for a more reliable long term supply of water that would be more cost effective and would have infinitely less economic and social impact on those affected by the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The choice of water supply options is a matter for the Queensland Government.

        Where, as with the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam, a proposal is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of NES, it is then assessed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts under the EPBC Act as described above.

        Works can only commence on Traveston Crossing Dam if and when all required State and Commonwealth approvals have been granted, including approval under the EPBC Act.

        While the federal Minister for the Environment and Water Resources is required to follow strict processes in assessing the Traveston Crossing Dam under the

       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         require the Queensland Government to apply for EPBC Act approval for both stages one and two. The two stages of the project are so integrally entwined that we see very little logic in the two stages being separated for environmental assessment, especially when the proposed dam wall is intended to be constructed to stage two height at the outset. We consider it highly unlikely that stage one will have much benefit without proceeding to stage two, and even then the proposal is deeply flawed as a way of meeting southeast Queensland's future water needs;
        </li>
        <li>
         pay close attention in his determination of the social and economic impact of the dam's construction as required by the EPBC Act;
        </li>
        <li>
         very seriously consider the overwhelming evidence on the danger to unique fauna species in the river system which the imposition of conditions will not overcome; and
        </li>
        <li>
         very seriously investigate the allegations of the failure by the Queensland Government to comply with conditions imposed on the Paradise Dam.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The process by which the Traveston Crossing Dam will be assessed under the EPBC Act is described above in the response to Recommendation 1 of the Senate Committee report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The action that has been referred by the proponent (Queensland Water Infrastructure Pty Ltd) and that is currently being assessed under the EPBC Act, includes building of the Traveston Crossing Dam wall to ‘stage two’ height, with inundation and operation of the dam at ‘stage one’ level only.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Queensland Government has confirmed that no decision has been made on whether or not to progress operation of the dam at stage two capacity and that such a decision is not anticipated until closer to 2035. The Queensland Government has also advised that the potential consequential impacts of inundation and operation of the dam at stage two capacity will be considered, to the extent that is possible, during the current assessment process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Queensland Government have been notified that if stage two is pursued in the future, it will also need to be referred to determine if assessment and approval under the EPBC Act is necessary before it can proceed.

        Although the proposal to build the Wyaralong Dam received less attention during the inquiry, we consider the evidence tended to the Committee regarding its shortcomings to have been compelling. The Queensland government's case for constructing Wyaralong is far from convincing, especially in the light of the many apparently superior proposals for supply in the area. Before committing any further resources to this project, we would urge the Queensland government to re-examine the alternatives more closely and reconsider its decision.

        Whilst there have been some positive projects developed by the Queensland government in recent times encouraging water tanks and other rainwater harvesting, there is far more that can be done and can be achieved in this area. Should the Queensland government continue in its refusal to adopt a comprehensive evidence based, best practice approach to delivering sustainable and secure long-term water supplies for south-east Queensland, the federal government should use its powers and responsibilities under the National Water Initiative to ensure the large amounts of money being splashed around are properly applied.

It will also identify investment priorities, and examine policy and regulatory reforms to improve the efficient utilisation of existing infrastructure.
