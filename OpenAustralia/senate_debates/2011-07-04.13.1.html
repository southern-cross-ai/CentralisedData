               I thank Senator Ludlam for presenting himself. I congratulate Senator Parry as well. I submit that Senator Ludlam would be a better choice for the position of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
                Deputy President

               and Chairman of Committees.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do object to the arrangement where we are now going to see the Labor Party support the coalition's nominee en bloc and, as we saw with the vote for you as President, the coalition's voting with the Labor Party en bloc. One of these days we will get to the more sensible arrangement of not only nominating but choosing senators on the basis of merit rather than on the basis of this cosy arrangement. It is significant that this arrangement is here at the outset. There has been talk about the balance of power.

               will use that responsibly and for a stable procedure of governance in this parliament and in this place on behalf of the Australian people. That said, it is very clear here that, in the majority of the workings of this Senate, we will see the government and opposition come together to pass legislation and the precedent is being set here today.

                  On behalf of the government and all Labor senators I congratulate Senator Parry on his election to the important role of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
                   Deputy President
                  </a>
                  and Chair of Committees. I think it is a waste of a good whip, myself! But congratulations to Senator Parry. I know he will be conscientious and effective in the role and will learn the skills of Deputy President, which involve impartiality and balance—things which one does not have to display as a whip! I know Senator Parry has the capacity to do that, and I hope he does forge a strong partnership with President Hogg—though perhaps not as strong as the former President and Deputy President did; they were a very effective team, and a little too close for comfort on occasions! But we do look forward to that strong working relationship. Again, congratulations.

                   </a>
                   . We are confident that he will be able to undertake the role with dignity and purpose. I am sure that his former career as a policeman will assist him in enforcing the rules—and, just in case he does not succeed, his former role as an undertaker may come in even more helpful! We wish Senator Parry well. He has the full support of the coalition as he takes on this new role.

I note that the vote just revealed to us does not include the full complement of people in here. I would be interested to know where those spare ones went to.

                     of the Senate. Stephen has had some major successes. The best one, of course, was when he got us back our superannuation. Stephen, we are still waiting for that, mate! I am sure he will hold the office with the dignity it deserves. He acknowledges that the office is a great honour that the nation has bestowed upon him. I also give my condolences to the Greens for not quite making it there—apparently the other votes were all for Sarah Hanson-Young!

                      I echo the remarks of my colleagues in congratulating Senator Parry on his new role. I think Senator Ludlam was a worthy adversary. I will miss Senator Parry as whip—but I am sure the feeling is not mutual! I wish him well in his new role.
