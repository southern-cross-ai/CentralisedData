           The advertising campaign for the Infrastructure Investment Program will increase knowledge amongst Australian road users of the need for investment in transport infrastructure. Research undertaken by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development shows that 85 per cent of people want to receive information about the Australian government's investment in this area. The campaign will go through the proper channels before rollout and is subject to the government's guidelines and independent scrutiny by the Independent Communications Committee. Government advertising expenditure has been lower since the coalition was elected in 2013, and I note that during the 2013 campaign the previous government ordered the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance_and_Deregulation" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           to run an advertising campaign, contrary to longstanding caretaker conventions.
