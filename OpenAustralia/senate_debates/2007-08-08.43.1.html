        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        . Is the minister aware that Senator Parry made a submission to the review of the Tasmanian hospital system on 10 April 2004 supporting the reform of the Tasmanian health system? Is the minister further aware that Senator Parry’s submission stated that duplication of health services in north-west Tasmania had failed to deliver the standard of care that the community needed and indeed deserved? Is the minister also aware that Senator Parry wrote to the Tasmanian health minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Giddings" rel="nofollow">
         Lara Giddings
        </a>
        , on 7 February this year supporting the state government’s plans for reform, stating that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am encouraged that at long last we are tackling the real issues of duplication in order to provide better health services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that Senator Parry’s position is now clear, can the minister explain why Minister Abbott now asserts that this is not his view?

         I am not aware of the submission that Senator McLucas refers to, but, in relation to the Commonwealth government’s position, it is quite clear that we aim to have a health system which benefits all Australians and, where we have state and territory governments that fall down in their duty, we will back up those communities that have suffered from the negligence of those state and territory governments. I am advised that Senator Parry put out a statement. That statement, which I understand is dated today, says that comments attributed to Senator Parry in the company of others, including a journalist, have been taken out of context. Senator Parry states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am disappointed that the Labor Party has mischievously used a remark from a private conversation to achieve political mileage regarding the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersey_Community_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          Mersey Community Hospital
         </a>
         . I support the Government’s plans to deliver a sustainable, safe and viable health system for the people of Tasmania.
        </p>
        <p>
         The people of north-west Tasmania would be better served if Mr Rudd, the Labor Party and the Tasmanian government supported the government’s actions to improve hospital services, including the Mersey Community Hospital. The injection of $45 million should free up additional resources for north-west health services. Senator Parry, a very strong supporter of medical services in Tasmania, endorses the actions that the government have taken—and quite rightly so—in addressing community concerns where there is a gap in the provision of health services due to the negligence of the state government. The national government of Australia will not stand by and see the diminution of services to the Australian people because of the negligence of state and territory governments.

                , I ask a supplementary question. Why is the government heavying Senator Parry, as evidenced in the press release that the minister has just referred to, when his considered views are supported by locals like the Mayor of Burnie, the Burnie Chamber of Commerce, clinical staff at the hospital, the Tasmanian AMA and the Tasmanian health minister? Why has the government placed the advice of Canberra and Sydney based pollsters Crosby Textor ahead of Senator Parry from Tasmania, who has listened to Tasmanians and called the intervention a disaster?

                 I think Senator Parry has made his position quite clear in the statement I have related to the Senate. Senator Parry is a very independent senator, as I know firsthand. He has made his position as to where he stands very clear by this statement—that is, to see increased provision of health services to the people of Tasmania.
