         The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) There is one current Standard Funding Agreement between the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) and the MacDonnell Shire Council for urgent repairs and upgrades to the Kintore, Areyonga and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Teresa" rel="nofollow">
          Santa Teresa
         </a>
         swimming pools. (a) No. (b) Yes. A copy of the Funding Agreement and relevant variations is at Attachment A
         <i>
          (available from the Senate Table Office)
         </i>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) It is not the role of FaHCSIA to collect information from schools on the 'no school, no pool' rule. Nor does the Department impose conditions on the operation of swimming pools. Communities determine these arrangements at the local level.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) It is not the role of FaHCSIA to collect information on how many children are refused access to pools due to the 'no school no pool' rule. Nor does the Department impose conditions on the operation of swimming pools. Communities determine and enforce these arrangements at the local level.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) No. These are local arrangements worked out at the community level.
