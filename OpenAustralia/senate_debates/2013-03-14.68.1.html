        My question is to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy
        </a>
        , Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to the provisions of the ironically titled
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Media" rel="nofollow">
         News Media
        </a>
        (Self-Regulation) Bill 2013 that would cause the Public Interest Media Advocate to begin assessing the eligibility of a news media self-regulatory body for declaration under the act as early as next month. Has the minister, or anyone acting on his or the government's behalf, already sounded out anyone to fill the role of the Public Interest Media Advocate and, if so, who?

             On the question of the selection of the media advocate or if anybody has been approached, to my knowledge that has not occurred. But I do appreciate the conspiracy theories that have run amok over there—the vengeance, that we have already stitched up a trade union thug, as Senator Brandis keeps shouting. But no,

              , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to the provisions of the Public Interest Media Advocate Bill 2013 and promises made by both the Prime Minister and the minister yesterday that the opposition would be consulted on the appointment of the Public Interest Media Advocate, as well as promises made repeatedly by the minister that he does not believe that a politician or a former politician would hold the role. Why are such requirements or prohibitions not included in the bill?

               Another conspiracy has been uncovered. As has been indicated, the Prime Minister has publicly stated that we will be following the Nolan principles and that we will be consulting. We are very comfortable with that commitment and we are very comfortable with adding those to the bill. So let me be very clear: we will be following the Nolan principles.

                , I ask a further supplementary question. I note the minister's media reform package comprises six bills and more than 130 pages of new regulations. Given that the minister is so concerned about the public interest, how does the minister believe it can at all be in the public interest to ram such unprecedented changes through by guillotining legislation in the parliament and allowing so little time for public scrutiny of these reforms?

                    , I rise on a point of order. The minister is at serious risk of misleading the Senate if he goes down the 'two full inquiries' path. There is only one inquiry into this legislation and it is due to report in just four working days.

                     Senator Birmingham, that is not a point of order. That is a debating point which you can use after three o'clock when you take note of the answers, if you desire.

                      The Finkelstein inquiry. Cabinet had public meetings and took submissions. The Convergence Review had public meetings in regions across Australia. The public were invited to make submissions. Hours and hours of discussion have taken place on this. The fact that you have not asked me a single question on this topic in the last two years has got more to do with you than it has—

                      Well, maybe you can remember one. I think you only asked me two or three last year in total. But there have been countless hours, countless column inches, countless report pages and we are not going to be in a circumstance where we are going to be bartered on this. The parliament has a choice: support diversity in the media and ensure the standard of the press—
