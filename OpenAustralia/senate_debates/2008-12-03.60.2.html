        My question is to the Minister for Human Services, Senator Ludwig. With an increase of more than eight per cent in complaints about Centrelink’s service, will the government now accept that they have made the wrong decision in axing the local liaison officer program within Centrelink?

         I can say that the local liaison officer program was one of those that the opposition put in when they were in government. It did not address the concerns and issues that were raised in local constituencies. We ensured that the local liaison officer program was not continued. Why? Because it was not actually delivering. A much better system to put in place is one where, if you have an issue in your constituency, you can go to your local electorate office and deal with it. We have good relations with each of those electorate offices. When issues are raised that people want brought forward then those specific agencies, like Centrelink or Medicare, can talk through and have contact with the electorate offices and deal with them in a sensible way. That is a far more practical way than having a local liaison officer program in place. Centrelink has been working through each of those offices. Of course, agencies across the Human Services portfolio deal with not only local constituents that are referred to from electorate offices but also a significant amount of correspondence from those electorate offices. I can assure the Senate and you,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

         , that correspondence—which I see personally—comes to me from the electoral offices of those opposite and of those of us on this side of the chamber through all of the agencies across the Human Services portfolio: Medicare, Centrelink, the

          I thank the minister for the answer and I thank him for conceding that the new system has, in fact, delivered eight per cent less service than that of the previous government.

          , I ask a supplementary question. The government’s arbitrary 3.5 per cent efficiency dividend imposed this year has reduced Centrelink’s ability to provide services to Australians. Centrelink’s own annual report stated that the reviews completed on time were down by four per cent and that requests for appeals on Centrelink decisions were up by more than 6,000. Given the increase in consumer demand, will the government now concede that they also got this wrong and restore the funding to Centrelink?

          <p>
           Those opposite misrepresented the question. There was no concession in respect of the impact of the removal of the local liaison officer program. In fact, it was quite the opposite. If you look at the staff that have been provided to electorate offices, you have an additional electorate officer to deal with the issues of constituents in all of our offices. If you choose to use them in that way then they are a valuable resource for your constituents to work through any of the issues that may arise. But if you choose not to use them in that way then that is a decision you make within your own offices. I can say that Centrelink has been working diligently. It has been out there across Australia helping those people who are in need. It has been helping people in Queensland who have been suffering under the storms and the floods. It is also providing the $10.4 billion—

               , on a point of order: I know we are trialling this new system, but it seems to have become the habit of the opposition firstly to slur the minister on starting their supplementary questions and then, often, to ask supplementary questions that have nothing to do with the primary question. I appreciate that we have this trial, under which you indicated that you would take a fairly liberal approach to see how things transpired and to learn from those things. I appreciate and respect that, but I think that the sort of behaviour that is developing ought not to be permitted. It is not appropriate for senators to disparage the ministers at the start of their supplementaries, nor is it appropriate for them to fail to address the broader question even vaguely in their supplementaries. I ask you to give consideration to that, even though we are having a fairly liberal interpretation of the new system.

                , I rise to speak on the point of order. I acknowledge that I was not disparaging the minister in any way in terms of the answer to the principal question. It was the Ombudsman’s report that indicated the eight per cent increase in complaints. I was simply reflecting that he made no attempt at all to answer the question in my first supplementary. An efficiency dividend of 3.5 per cent had been implemented and the outcome of that was that reviews completed were down by four per cent and Centrelink decision appeals were up by 6,000, and he made no attempt to answer the question. I was not reflecting upon the minister; I was simply reflecting on my disappointment that he failed completely to answer the question.

Centrelink found itself in that position and, rather than sit on its haunches, it went out and did some proactive work.
