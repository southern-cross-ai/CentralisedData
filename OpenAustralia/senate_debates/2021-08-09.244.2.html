        Over recent months, I've spoken in this place about some of Tasmania's celebrated leaders, like Joe and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Enid_Lyons" rel="nofollow">
         Dame Enid Lyons
        </a>
        and the Hodgman family. These people were instrumental in shaping the Tasmanian political landscape, and, today, as I once again reflect on some amazing Tasmanians, I want to speak more personally about two women who played a part in shaping the politician I am: the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Napier" rel="nofollow">
         Sue Napier
        </a>
        and Dr Vanessa Goodwin. Both of these women were strong, impressive leaders in politics and within the Tasmanian community. I had the pleasure of working with them both and saw firsthand the value of the service and commitment they gave to the Tasmanian parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        The late Dr Vanessa Goodwin was a criminologist who served in the Tasmanian parliament as Attorney-General, Minister for Justice and Minister for Corrections. With impressive academic qualifications and unique career experiences, Vanessa brought thoughtful and distinctive insights to her ministerial responsibilities which were widely welcomed. Vanessa was a member of Tasmania's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Legislative Council
        </a>
        for Pembroke on Hobart's eastern shore between 2009 and 2017. While in opposition, Dr Goodwin researched strategies to improve the Tasmanian justice system, including prison reform, sentencing and youth crime prevention programs. She wanted to cut crime rates and put her research into action at the first opportunity. When the Hodgman Liberal government won power in 2014, Dr Goodwin was appointed to all three justice portfolios. She achieved a number of important reforms within the Tasmanian justice system during her time in cabinet, with progress still continuing on some of those policies now. She also served as Minister for the Arts and Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Goodwin's parliamentary career was cut short by brain cancer in 2018. She was just 48. Her intellect and compassion were remembered by all sides of politics and the general public as they mourned her death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born in 1969, Vanessa had grown up at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Rose Bay
        </a>
        and Acton on Hobart's eastern shore. She graduated from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws. One of her first jobs was as associate to the then Tasmanian Chief Justice,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Green" rel="nofollow">
         Guy Green
        </a>
        , later
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Guy" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Guy
        </a>
        , and as a research assistant for the Tasmanian governor. Vanessa also worked as a criminologist with the department of police and public safety, researching and developing crime prevention tactics. She also studied a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy" rel="nofollow">
         Master of Philosophy
        </a>
        in criminology at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" rel="nofollow">
         University of Cambridge
        </a>
        . Her thesis covered mass murders, a topic she revisited when completing her PhD with the University of Tasmania. Vanessa interviewed more than 50 maximum-security inmates at Risdon prison about their burglary habits for her doctorate. These male prisoners, some of them hardened criminals, happily shared their lives of crime with the softly spoken PhD candidate. Her report into intergenerational crime in 2009 showed an entrenched culture of welfare dependency, alcohol abuse, domestic violence and child neglect over successive generations in some families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Goodwin's involvement in politics began as a teenager, when she helped her mother, Edyth Langham-Goodwin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , to campaign in several elections for the Liberal Party. Vanessa later contested the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         House of Assembly
        </a>
        seat of Franklin at the 2006 Tasmanian election and at the 2007 federal election. She was successfully elected in 2009, winning her seat as the member for Pembroke by a large margin, and was re-elected in 2013. Her strong work ethic, determination and persistence quickly won the respect of colleagues, political opponents and the public.
       </p>
       <p>
        Outside of politics, Vanessa was a Churchill scholarship holder, a Rotarian and a fitness enthusiast. Her diagnosis with multiple brain tumours in 2017 came as a shock and generated a flood of public support. It was the same cancer that had taken the life of her mother the previous year. Vanessa resigned from the Tasmanian parliament in October 2017 and died just five months later. A state funeral was held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_David's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
         St David's Cathedral
        </a>
        in Hobart for Dr Goodwin, with former Premier Will Hodgman delivering the eulogy for his friend. He described Vanessa as a trailblazer who left Tasmania much poorer for her passing.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University" rel="nofollow">
         The University
        </a>
        of Tasmania and the Tasmanian government established the Dr Vanessa Goodwin Law Reform Scholarship in her honour—a fitting tribute to this remarkable Tasmanian woman.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to recognise Sue Napier, who famously campaigned using the slogan 'The best man for the job is a woman'—and she certainly was. Sue was the first woman to lead the Tasmanian Liberal Party and to lead a major political party in the Tasmanian parliament. Described as a small-l liberal, Sue served in numerous portfolios but was especially interested in Tasmanians having fair access to quality health and education. Her parliamentary career came to an untimely end in 2010 when she faced a second battle with breast cancer. Unfortunately, this time it was a battle she could not win.

        Born on the first day of 1948 at Latrobe in Tasmania's north-west, Susan Braid was one of three children born to Harry and Maisie Braid. The Braids were farmers but were also active in Tasmanian politics. Sue's father, Henry Braid—or Harry—served in the Legislative Council between 1972 and 1990, and was President of the chamber in 1983-84. His cousin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Braid" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Braid
        </a>
        was a Liberal member for Wilmott—now Lyons—twice during his political career, serving as a cabinet minister in the 1980s and 1990s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sue worked for the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education—which became the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology and later the University of Tasmania—for 20 years from January 1972. Her specialist areas were physical education, sports psychology and motor learning. Sue became active in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
         Young Liberals
        </a>
        in the 1970s and served as president of the organisation, later becoming a member of the Tasmanian Liberal Party. She resigned from her position at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTAS" rel="nofollow">
         UTAS
        </a>
        to stand as a Liberal candidate for Bass at the state election in 1992.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sue was successful, raising issues in her first speech that we are still grappling with almost 30 years later. Sue spoke about the need for caring communities, for parliament to conduct itself with dignity and decorum, for antidiscrimination legislation and for action on domestic violence and the protection of minors from pornographic material. Sue also had strong opinions on the Tasmanian economy. She believed in reducing state debt, spending within the state's capacity and maintaining government accounts that accurately reflect the true financial situation. She stuck with these sentiments during her whole parliamentary career.
       </p>
       <p>
        Early in her 18-year parliamentary career, Sue was made Assistant Minister for the Status of Women and Youth Affairs, and in 1985 she was promoted to Minister for Transport, Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TT" rel="nofollow">
         TT
        </a>
        -Line and Minister for Youth Affairs. She won a second term at the 1996 election and became
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Premier
        </a>
        and Minister for Education and Minister for Arts, Sport and Recreation. Topping the poll in Bass at the 1998 state election, Sue watched Labor rise under former union leader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Bacon" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Bacon
        </a>
        . She became opposition leader in 1999 and served as the shadow minister for health and human services, racing, sport and recreation, and women between 2000 and 2006. She later took on a number of other shadow portfolios, including education and skills, environment, heritage and the arts, social inclusion and climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sue was diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2008 and initially responded well to treatment. However, early in 2010, she announced she would retire from parliament and not contest the Tasmanian election that year, as her cancer had returned. Outside politics, Sue served the Tasmanian community through positions on the Tasmanian Netball Association, the University of Tasmania Academic Senate and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council" rel="nofollow">
         National Council
        </a>
        of Women. She was a Fellow of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Council
        </a>
        for Health,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Physical Education
        </a>
        and Recreation. Her personal interests included golf, fishing, walking the dog and spending time with her beloved family. Respected by all sides of politics for her work ethic, integrity and compassion, Sue was made a life member of the Liberal Party in 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sue died from breast cancer in August 2010 aged 62, just months after her husband, Drew, died from oesophageal cancer. They are survived by their sons James and Alex. As with Vanessa, in recognition of Sue's contribution to Tasmania and to education, the state government, with the support of all sides of politics, agreed to annually fund two education scholarships in her name to encourage and support deserving Tasmanians to become teachers, particularly those who might not otherwise be able to afford it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both Vanessa Goodwin and Sue Napier left strong legacies within Tasmanian politics as role models for parliamentarians and, especially, women who aspire to enter politics, like myself. It was an honour to have been able to call them my friends.
