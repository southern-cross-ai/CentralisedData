        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Senator Johnston. In light of the Victorian election result—an election which Prime Minister Tony Abbott labelled a 'referendum on the East West Link'—will the minister acknowledge that his government lost the 'referendum' and that the people of Victoria overwhelmingly voted for investment in public transport not for massive, polluting, new tollways?

         Thank you for that question. Let me begin by saying the two are not mutually exclusive. Let's talk about East West Link. Last week I indicated that this government is spending on infrastructure to 2019-20 some $50 billion around Australia. We are spending $7.6 billion in Victoria alone. It is very disappointing that the new Victorian government is looking at backing out of the commitment for us to fund about $3 billion to the East West Link. That program will have a significant impact upon the Victorian economy, but more particularly on local jobs. About 6,700 local jobs are involved with this program.
        </p>
        <p>
         What the government wants to do is work with the new Premier in Victoria to see if there is a way forward, such that we can provide this important policy initiative to the people of Victoria. I explained in great detail some of the time abbreviations that this project, were it to be delivered, would provide to various parts of Melbourne. The six-kilometre link connecting the

          , I ask a supplementary question. I remind the minister of the outcome of the election, or 'referendum', and that people overwhelmingly voted for public transport not the East West Link. So will the government reallocate the $3 billion committed to East West Link to infrastructure projects that Victorians really want—namely, public transport projects? Or will the federal government cut Victorians loose and take back the funding?

           I can only say that this program, as I have outlined, is a big and positively beneficial program. And, given that there will be many buses and taxis using this connection, you would have to say that it would make a huge contribution to public transport in itself. I do not think 6,700 jobs should be scoffed at. I think this is important for Victoria and we will work with the new Premier to see if we can deliver it.

            , I rise to ask a final supplementary question. I draw the minister's attention to a recent report by the Tourism and Transport Forum on the economic return of investment in public transport where they outline the increased economic growth in areas of Sydney which benefitted from the development of the Epping-Chatswood rail link compared with the rest of Sydney. Given these economic benefits and the jobs benefits, why will the government not redirect the $3 billion of funding to public transport projects in Victoria?

             I think there is a fundamental false premise in your question. When you talk of public transport, you seem to want to say that that is just about rail. This is not true. Buses and taxis use the roads. They are part of the public transport infrastructure. The fact is I have explained to you why we like this project and why we are prepared to invest in it. It is fundamentally good for Victorians. It is not mutually exclusive. States and the Commonwealth can negotiate about rail or about air or about shipping and other methods of public transport. But the bottom line is: this program is a very good program and should be pursued in cooperation with the new government in Victoria.
