           Cole Miller
          </a>
          , a fine young Queenslander who sadly lost his life to an unprovoked, alcohol-fuelled coward punch only a few weeks ago in Brisbane. In honour of Cole Miller and others who have lost their lives or been injured as a result of alcohol-fuelled violence I would like to establish an inquiry to investigate the need for a national strategy to address and reduce the scourge of alcohol-fuelled violence. No parent should ever have to endure the pain and suffering that Cole's parents are currently dealing with. The community desperately wants action, and I am determined to see that change happens. I have been overwhelmed by the support for this inquiry from members of the community, including

A new ministerial drug and alcohol forum will be formed to oversee the development, implementation and monitoring of Australia's National Drug Policy framework. The forum will initially meet in the first half of 2016, and alcohol-related violence will be a key focus for this forum.
