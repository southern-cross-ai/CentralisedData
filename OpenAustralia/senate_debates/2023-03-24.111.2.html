            Most Australians know the smallgoods advertising campaign with the slogan: 'Is Don. Is good.' Sadly, this week Senator Farrell has looked and sounded more like a turkey than any sorts of tasty smallgoods, with answer after answer comprising nothing but gobbledegook, endless ums and ahs, stalling tactics, pauses and evasion tactics to get to the end of every single question and run the clock down.

              President, it has been an extraordinary show this week from the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, so extraordinary that it does warrant consideration of an extraordinary motion that necessitates the suspension of standing orders. Senator Farrell, during the course of this week, was asked about the rate of electricity price increases in Australia. What did we get? 'Don't know.' He was asked about the rate of grocery price increases in Australia. What did we get? 'Don't know.' Senator Farrell was asked about the rate of rental rate increases in Australia. What did we get? 'Don't know.' Senator Farrell was asked about the rate of mortgage increases in Australia. And what did we get? 'Don't know.'

                  So extraordinary has it been, that not only has Senator Farrell indicated he doesn't know the answers to these things, but, on power prices, he admitted: 'I do not follow power prices closely.' Right around Australia, households and small businesses are opening their power bills, each and every day, under the shock of the increasing rates of electricity, with genuine concern and pressures that they are feeling, and here we have the Albanese Labor government saying it doesn't know, it doesn't follow it and, apparently, it seems, it just does not care.

                    It doesn't care. It is a government, indeed, that is out of touch. Of course, it isn't just in relation to those matters affecting the cost-of-living pressures on Australians that we've seen this remarkable performance. Even on national security matters, such as cybersecurity protections of

                        As we approach the one-year anniversary of the Albanese government, it is worth this chamber taking the time to debate the extraordinary list of broken promises that have been racked up and the denial of them that is occurring on the other side. Time and again, we have sought to get the government to respond directly to their promise that they would reduce household electricity prices by $275. During the course of this week we actually asked them to acknowledge direct quotes out of their own policy document. They won't acknowledge it. We've even handed the document across the chamber with the quote highlighted. They still wouldn't acknowledge it. We even asked Senator Farrell yesterday just to say the words 'two hundred and seventy-five dollars'. He could not say them. He would not say them.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        They will not admit that on more than 97 occasions before Australians cast their votes they went out and promised power price reductions of $275. And then the day after the election, and not once since have they been willing to repeat that promise. Not on one single day have any of you been game to repeat that promise—nor has Prime Minister Albanese—because you knew you never had an intention of delivering it. You knew it would never happen. It was a broken promise from the moment you made it, just like your promises not to change superannuation taxes, just like your promises not to change franking credits. They're all broken promises from a government that has demonstrated just how inept it is, how committed to breaking its promises it is and, as a result, how much the Australian people are feeling the pain from a government showing so early how out of touch it is.

                         I've got to say, I'm pretty disappointed in Senator Birmingham. You should have left these schoolboy tactics behind—maybe at university, even. One of the reasons why—and I don't think you've quite understood this, Senator Birmingham—you only got 71 likes on your Facebook the other day is nobody is listening to you.

But it has really hit home this week for the opposition: it seems to be an increasingly irrelevant and obstructionist gathering of senators in this place who are determined to undermine, distract and cause damage to anything constructive that tries to be done in this place. That's what we've been seeing. That's why here we are, with the last 10 minutes of the Senate sitting this week, dealing with a suspension debate. Nothing else, just a suspension debate, essentially reflecting on their conduct this week.

We've gone around implementing our election commitments. We've gone around with the commitments we made to the Australian people to put those in place, and you have voted no at pretty much every single opportunity. That's what has happened, and that's why we find ourselves here, with 10 minutes to go, discussing this suspension motion, which won't even get completed by the end of the time the Senate sits. That's the strategic brilliance of what's being put before the Senate today!
                                                                         </p>

We have been implementing our policies to invest in early childhood education. We have been implementing policies to put downward pressure on energy prices. You even voted no to that—$1½ billion going in to ensure people's power bills don't increase to the point that they otherwise would have, and you voted no to that! I mean, honestly! How do you go back to your jurisdictions and explain that to constituents? How do you go back and say: 'Oh, well, actually, you know what? The government tried to put downward pressure on your electricity bills, and we said no.' There's a badge of honour! There's something ticked off in Canberra!

All the attempts that we make, like our secure jobs, better pay legislation—you say no, no, no. Nothing. All the bills that were in place for this week—you said no to all of them. National Reconstruction Fund? No. Housing Australia Future Fund? No. That's not good enough for those opposite! You didn't do anything in 10 years and you don't want to do anything for the next year either, it seems. The Housing Australia Future Fund—who could oppose putting extra money into housing?

Why is it so important that we be given an opportunity to note what has been outlined in Senator Birmingham's motion? In the first instance, the role of the government when it comes here is to justify itself to the Australian people. For one hour a day, those who are not in government are given the opportunity from two o'clock until three o'clock—and we've had members in the gallery today join us—to pursue what is called question time. The role of question time has been one that has been here since the time parliament commenced. The mere fact that you clearly don't know what the role of question time is says a lot. During question time—

Looking at the substance of the motion that Senator Birmingham has moved, why should we take note of this? Because it is important for us as the opposition to hold the government to account for broken promises. The government went to the election and stated certain things to the Australian people. Are we saying we should not note this fact in the chamber? Are we saying that it is not important enough for this place to actually note that, prior to the election, Mr Albanese said on over 97 occasions, 'I will reduce your power bills by $275'? And you had in the Australian Senate this week a simple question. Can you actually even say the words '$275'? The minister can't even bring himself to say the words '$275'.
                                                                               </p>

It is of great importance because the contempt that has been on display to this place, to the people who've joined us here in the gallery this week and to the Australian people has, quite frankly, been like nothing I've seen in my almost 15 years here.
