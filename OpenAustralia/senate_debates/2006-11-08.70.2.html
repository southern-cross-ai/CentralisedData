          and foreshadow that I will be moving that amendment. But I guess we all know what the issue is, in any case. It is becoming a bit of a case of ‘here we go again’ every time a

           Committee
          </a>
          report is tabled. I indicate that, whilst I am a member of that committee, I was not able to attend yesterday’s meeting. The cloning legislation was in the committee stage at the time the meeting was held and I did not think I was in a position to step out from that debate to go to it, particularly given that we all know what happens these days in Selection of Bills Committee meetings—we just get the legislation served up and the government insists on ridiculously unrealistic time frames.
         </p>
         <p>
          The proposal here, if I heard the minister correctly, was 30 November for the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Democrats" rel="nofollow">
           The Democrats
          </a>
          believe that is far too short a time frame for what we believe is significant legislation which is of interest to the community and on which the parliament would benefit from having access to the expertise and views in the community.
         </p>
         <p>
          I should emphasise that, with Senate committee processes, as a party and as senators we would like more time to be able to consider things—30 November is three weeks away. Whilst we have two non-sitting weeks in front of that, I do not know about the rest of us, but mine are pretty much wall-to-wall committees and inquiries already, given all of the other legislation and issues that we have jam-packed in and on which we have to report by the end of year.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is not just about giving ourselves more time or making life more convenient, although I do think, frankly, it is appropriate, given the significance of the role that is entrusted to us, that we show respect in doing at least some semblance of a reasonable job. It is also part of the public education and public debate process.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
           The Senate
          </a>
          committee processes are not just for the convenience of senators; they actually play an important part in enabling the information to get out into the public arena. The people in the press gallery endeavour, of course, to forensically follow every piece of legislation that comes through here and ensure they give comprehensive coverage on all of the detail on significant matters. Also, of course, for people in the wider community—particularly these days, with more use of the internet, with submissions and
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          being online and also often with committee inquiry hearings being streamed so that people are able to watch them—there is much more ability for those who are interested to be able to follow, react, respond and put the debate out quite quickly to interested sections of the community that may have nothing to do with the mainstream media.
         </p>
         <p>
          I guess in that sense we can perhaps accept that we can be a little quicker than we were five years ago with some of these inquiries, but, once again, this is far too short a time frame—31 January is not stretching it out into the ether; it is still a fairly short time frame when you consider that Christmas will be intervening. A lot of people will obviously be focused on other things and having a bit of a break. To allow only three weeks in effect for such legislation, I believe, is really bringing the political process into disrepute.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is not the first time; this is pretty much a weekly occurrence when we sit. Legislation is tabled, immediately bundled off to a committee, shunted to an extremely quick hearing with an extraordinarily short turnaround time for people to put in submissions, with absurdly short time frames for reports to be written and then bundled into the Senate and railroaded through before half of us even know what it is that we are looking at. It draws the Senate and the whole process into disrepute.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sometimes_I" rel="nofollow">
           Sometimes I
          </a>
          wonder if it is not actually part of the government’s agenda to do that. Either way, we do not need to speculate on the agenda. The consequence is a very poor one. It is a poor process. We are not just debating points here; we are making laws and we should at least show the public the courtesy and respect of doing our job properly, given they have given us the responsibility of being in parliament.

             also believe that the reporting date is absolutely ridiculous. The government’s proposed reporting date of November is ridiculous if they are truly trying to encourage a proper informed analysis of these legislative amendments. The proposed amendments are quite significant, and I believe members of the community will want to comment on them. To meaningfully analyse the import of these amendments takes a period of time. It takes time to get out and inform people that these changes are happening. As these changes have only come onto the agenda recently, people will not be aware of the extent of the changes. They need time to analyse them, to get their submissions in.

             members need time to adequately consider the submissions and make meaningful comment. The time allowed is insufficient to give proper analysis of the amendments, so we are supporting the amendment to the amendment that Senator Bartlett just tabled.

               Northern Territory
              </a>
              . The government is suggesting that, if this is not addressed, the Northern Land Council may be unwilling to nominate a site should a community within its jurisdiction wish to volunteer its land. How likely to happen is that? Any nominated site needs to be included in the current Commonwealth radioactive waste management legislation site characterisation program as soon as possible to ensure that such a site is given adequate consideration. Glory be! We know exactly why the government wants to have this reported in such an absurd and obscene time frame by 30 November.

              Senator Bartlett is quite right: considering the workload that the environment committee has, it is quite extraordinary. The environment committee is where this should be going; the government has referred it to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education—that in itself is an intriguing event, but never mind. The Australian people who are most affected by this legislation are yet again going to be denied an opportunity to participate meaningfully in an inquiry. Yet again, they are going to be excluded from the process of consideration of the detail of a bill and, yet again, they are going to have their hands forced by this government which is determined to find a site in the Northern Territory for radioactive waste. We are very concerned that yet again due process is being superseded by this extraordinary measure and we support an extension of the time for discussion and investigation of this legislation to the date proposed by Senator Bartlett.

                Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006
               </a>
               amends the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 and provides for the failure to comply with the site nomination rules in section 3B, and does not affect the validity of the minister’s approval under section 3C of a nomination. It amends it to remove any entitlement of procedural fairness in relation to a nomination made under section 3A and provides, should a nominated site ultimately be chosen for the Commonwealth radioactive waste management facility, for the Commonwealth to return the nominated site to its original owners when it is no longer required. The bill also amends the Administrative Decisions Act to exclude the application of the act to a site nomination under section 3A of the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act to ensure consistency with existing provisions of the act relating to sections 3C and 7 of that act.

               The bill is therefore a rather technical one but important nonetheless. It addresses concerns raised by the

               </a>
               in relation to nominating a site under the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act. If these concerns are not addressed, the Northern Land Council may be unwilling to nominate a site should a community within its jurisdiction wish to volunteer its land. Any nominated site needs to be included in the current site characterisation under the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act program as soon as possible to ensure that such a site is given adequate consideration within the current project schedule. So, if there is any nominated site, we need to deal with that as quickly as possible. If this reporting date is extended, as proposed by the Democrats, we will be taking this into early next year. We are able to deal with this act with sufficient Senate committee scrutiny and we can then deal with it in the final sitting fortnight, which is coming up. For those reasons, the government considers this to be urgent, and that is why I moved my amendment for an earlier date for reporting.
