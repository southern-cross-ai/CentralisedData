However, the Department of Infrastructure and Transport advises that no provision of the Airports Act 1996 prevents the use of the Jandakot Airport Chalet site for short-term accommodation. (c)The contract that the department has entered into for the provision of accommodation services at the Jandakot Airport Chalets uses pre-existing commercially available accommodation. There are no residential areas nearby and, as such, there was no community consultation, although nearby commercial activities were contacted. (d) The department has been assured by the owners of the Jandakot Airport Chalets that there was consultation with the management of Jandakot Airport Holdings Pty Ltd prior to entering into the contract with the department. The department has also consulted with Heliwest, the main training provider that used the services of the Jandakot Airport Chalets. Heliwest has advised that students and other aviation customers were offered alternative accommodation.
