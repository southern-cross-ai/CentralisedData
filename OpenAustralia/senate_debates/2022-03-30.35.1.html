        These amendments have been circulated. I want to make it very clear that it would be more equitable for more Australians to get the benefit of cheaper insurance through a government not-for-profit reinsurance scheme, which is what these amendments propose. If passed, these amendments also mean it would be less administratively burdensome, because the amended bill wouldn't require insurers to distinguish between the risk of non-cyclone-related floods and the risk of cyclone related floods, and it wouldn't require them to seek private market insurance for non-cyclone-related floods. In other words, all reinsurance for all flood damage would be covered under this scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        So these amendments expand the scope of the scheme, they make it more equitable and they mean that more Australians would benefit through lower insurance premiums, which are only going keep climbing, because of the climate emergency that we are living inâ€”the breakdown of our planet's climateâ€”which is being turbocharged by this government. Not least of the ways in which they have turbocharged the climate emergency is in the budget they released last night, which contains about $10 billion per year to encourage the accelerated burning and extraction of fossil fuels! Make no mistake, the budget is a budget brought down by a government that is turbocharging the climate crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        I observe that every single dollar of those public subsidies to encourage the extraction and burning of fossil fuels is also supported by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        . And what are we now about to see here in this chamber? Both major parties colluding to vote down these Greens amendments that would mean that more Australians get the benefit of a reduction in their insurance premiums as a result of nationalising reinsurance. As we move forward, we will see that more and more Australians need this benefit.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'll conclude by making a prediction. At some stage, in the not too distant future, the Senate will be here doing exactly what this amendment does: it will be increasing the scope of this scheme until, ultimatelyâ€”and this will be a great thing if it happensâ€”this country nationalises reinsurance for all climate-related so-called natural disasters. That would mean that we nationalise reinsurance with regard to floods, with regard to rising sea levels and with regard to bushfires, and that can't happen quickly enough. It will happen one day, mark my words.

         I want to place on the record Labor's voting position on this amendment: Labor won't be supporting this amendment. But I want to reiterate some of the views I put during the second reading debate. It is not as though this government has not been warned by insurance companies for very many years about the risks posed by climate change to the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. In fact, after our second reading debate, I went upstairs and had a bit of a look, because I remember when
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAG" rel="nofollow">
          IAG
         </a>
         â€”back in 2006!â€” took a national leadership role, undertook research and put a very public position about what climate change would cost, what it would mean for premiums and what it would mean for the economy. And what did the Howard government do? What did the Abbott government do? What did the Turnbull government do? What did the Morrison government do? Absolutely nothing of substance to address climate change. And here we are, 15 years laterâ€”15 years after the insurance companies first started ringing the bell about what climate change would mean for premiums, what it would mean for communities and what it would mean for the economy. Here we are, even in this term of government, with report after report having been provided to this governmentâ€”privately commissioned and publicly commissioned reviews about the costs and risks, the problems of underinsurance that arise from that and the economic challenges that that presents to communities, particularly in northern Australia. Here we are, probably in the very last day of the Senate sitting before the election, and the government are finally getting around to legislating their promise, but not with any data on the public record, of course, and not with any data on the tableâ€”they just all voted against putting on the table the data that underpins their policy decisionâ€”but wanting this Senate to support their position.
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, we will support the legislation; we'll vote for it. We want the relief that is promised by the government to flow through to communities as quickly as possible. We don't intend to hold up this bill by supporting the Greens amendments.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          The Greens
         </a>
         amendments are a very, very significant change indeed to the scope of the program that's proposed by government. They are of uncertain cost. We have no information about what the Greens' proposal would cost for the scheme, and we've got no information about what it would mean for policyholders and consumers. We're not prepared to hold up the bill. Labor would look at the inclusion of flood coverage as one of the terms in the statutory review that will already take place as a consequence of this legislation's passage, but we do not intend to vote for the amendments today.

          just add one quick point as well? A few days ago, the Greens flagged their intention to move these amendments, and I want to put on the record that our spokesperson on these matters, the member for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">
           Kingsford Smith
          </a>
          , Mr Thistlethwaite, wrote to the Greens, indicating that we thought that the extension of this pool to the flood areas was an idea worth considering. He wrote to the Greens, expressing that and asking them to advise us what the cost of such an amendment would be: What would be the cost to taxpayers? What would be the cost to insurance policyholders? You'll be shocked to know, Madam Chair, that the response from the Greens was: 'There won't be any cost.' Of course, that's Greens economics for you: you can do things, and they don't cost any money.
         </p>
         <p>
          As Senator McAllister has indicated and as I indicated in my second reading contribution, we do think that it is worth considering extending the reinsurance pool to areas that suffer from floods, but I think that, if we're going to do that, we should have some idea of what it's going to cost. It's not surprising that the Greens don't think that's worth considering. We think the responsible way to proceed is to support the reinsurance pool as it is currently proposed and to consider this possible extension as part of the statutory review, when we can understand what the cost would be to the taxpayer and to insurance policyholders. I think it's very important that people understand why Labor has taken the position that it has.
         </p>
         <p>
          I might just very quickly also note that it's disappointing that the second reading amendment that I moved was defeated by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
           One Nation
          </a>
          and the government. That amendment simply asked the government to come clean and release the modelling which they claim shows how much
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           North Queensland
          </a>
          ers will save as a result of the reinsurance pool. I asked Senator Hume to release this information at estimates, and amazingly she told the estimates hearing that it was not in the public interest for North Queenslanders to see the modelling that the government say they have about the savings that people will receive. That's why we moved the amendment, to try to get the government to release the modelling.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government have been making all sorts of claims in the media about how much people will save, but they refuse to release the proof that they say they have. I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed that One Nation voted with them to stop that information being released. As I have mentioned many, many times in this chamber, One Nation love to run around North Queensland pretending they're on the side of battlers in North Queensland. What they've done here today is vote with their allies in the Liberal-National coalition to stop North Queenslanders being able to see how much they will actually save from this reinsurance pool. One Nation is now in on this with the government in saying that North Queenslanders can't be trusted to see the information that the government say they have about what people will save. That is very disappointing, but it is true to form, because we know, at the end of the day, that One Nation is just another arm of the

           (â€”) (): I want to put on the record Labor's excuse for not voting for this bill and how their excuse is not supported by the communication and the discussion that the Greens had had with the Labor Party. In fact, Labor asked us: what would be the additional cost to government? We replied that there would be no additional cost. As was noted in the speech on the bill, the scheme has been designed to be cost neutral to the government over time because, basically, although this is government reinsurance changing who pays for the insurance, there will still be insurance purchased by people. It will reduce the cost of insurance from these massive events by, essentially, nationalising that insurance, but the cost is designed to be neutral over time. Expanding the scope of the scheme to include all flood damage wouldn't impact upon this objective. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Reinsurance_Pool_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation
           </a>
           would price the additional flood damage risk on a cost-neutral basis.
          </p>
          <p>
           Insurance is a really interesting representative of the issues that we are facing by living in a climate emergency, and the issues are not going to go away. The costs to Australian society and the costs globally of our climate emergency are going to continue to increase, and the reality of the floods that we have been experiencing over the past months are just an indicator of what we face in this country. It's not just flood damage from cyclones, as has been shown with the floods across Queensland and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           in recent months. None of these would have been eligible for this insurance scheme because they're not cyclone related. But we know that the impact of the climate emergency is going to be increasing intensity and increasing frequency of flood events not just from cyclones but from those heavy downpours. Frankly the science shows why they are happening. It's because we have got a warmer climate and there is more moisture in the atmosphere, so there is more ability for these flood events to occur.
          </p>
          <p>
           What we needâ€”and this is the only way to be dealing with thisâ€”is for Australia to be playing its part globally, to be acting at emergency speed, to be safeguarding our future and to be reducing the damage from our climate emergency, and that means we've got to get out of the mining, the burning and the export of coal, gas and oilâ€”full stop. That is what the science says. It's the only way that we're going to tackle the damage and the loss that is being felt by Australians and that is being felt around the world. Any government that is trying to delude themselves that there is any other way out is just thatâ€”deludedâ€”and they are misrepresenting the situation to the Australian community.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is very clear that we do not have a carbon budget left. There is no time to waste. We need to have an emergency shift and an emergency transition to get out of the mining, the burning and the export of coal, gas and oil. That is the reality that humanity is facing, and that's what this parliament needs to face up to. We need to work out how to do it in the way that best supports workers in that shift, and the Greens have got plans on the table as to how we would support workers who are currently working in those industries to be transitioned into new industries. We need to work out how to cope with the fact that there is already that climate change which is locked in. We're going to see floods, fires and other natural disasters due to the climate emergency continuing. Hence, measures like this reinsurance pool are important, but the reality is that they're not going to be enough. The only thing that is going to be taking the required action is to be getting out of the mining, the burning and export of fossil fuel, and both parties in this government need to realise that and need to be joining the Greens in taking the action that's required, if we are going to safeguard our future.

            I thank senators for that searing insight into what a Labor-Greens coalition might look like. Along with the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, the government supports the passage of this bill without amendment and, therefore, will be opposing this amendment. Insurance affordability from cyclones has been a longstanding issue in the north of our country. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
             ACCC
            </a>
            found that the main driver of high premiums in northern Australia was a higher natural hazard risk primarily driven by cyclones. Including all flood damage in a reinsurance pool would likely reduce the premium reductions available to residents in northern Australia, and we know that in other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, flood reinsurance pools have required a levy to ensure financial viability. We will be opposing the amendment.
