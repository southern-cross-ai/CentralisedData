        , Senator Cash. Can the minister explain to the Senate how a strong vocational education system is critical to running a strong economy, and what steps is the Morrison government undertaking to ensure that Australia has a world-class vocational education system?

         I thank Senator Chandler for what is a very important question. Senator Chandler, like those of us on this side of the chamber, understands that a strong vocational and educational training system in Australia is essential to a strong economy. We as a government are ensuring that vocational education and training in Australia is given the profile it deserves. We are committed on this side of the chamber to demonstrating to the Australian people that a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
          VET
         </a>
         qualification is just as good as a university degree. We are committed on this side of the chamber to ensuring that we have a system in place that delivers job-ready Australians, with the right skills, to employers. We have a $585 million skills package, which we announced in the budget and the Australian people endorsed at the most recent election, that we are now rolling out across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         But our most recent announcement is of course the inaugural Australian careers ambassador, Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Cam" rel="nofollow">
          Scott Cam
         </a>
         . The Prime Minister and I recently announced Scott Cam as Australia's inaugural careers ambassador. Scott Cam is a household name. He is a former apprentice. He undertook an apprenticeship in carpentry around 40 years ago. He is someone who has gone on to run his own business, employ Australians, employ other apprentices and, of course, achieve success in terms of becoming a household name. What those on the other side have conveniently forgotten is it works across both sides of politics, in particular when it comes to promoting apprenticeships. Scott Cam is uniquely placed to highlight the value, the career opportunities and the success that can be achieved through vocational education and training.

            For many years now university has been seen as the default expectation for young people who are finishing school. But of course it's not the only pathway that is available to them. It's all about understanding the choices that are available to you as you're making important decisions in relation to your career. All too often young Australians can be led down one path, and they're not necessarily told about the value in vocational education. It was recently highlighted that 31 of the 50 top-earning occupations now require a

            </a>
            qualification. I will say that again: 31 of the 50 top-earning occupations now require a VET qualification. The message is clear: a VET qualification can be lucrative and successful.

                Despite the interjections, those opposite seem to conveniently forget that, when they were last in government, they actually ripped the guts out of the vocational education and training system in Australia. Let's talk about Labor's legacy when it comes to vocational education and training in Australia. It was, of course, that great policy disaster—in fact, it has been described as possibly one of the biggest policy failures of all time—
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">

                </a>
                . What happened under VET FEE-HELP, Labor's signature policy when it comes to vocational education and training in Australia? What we saw was thousands of Australians, courtesy of the Labor government, receive dodgy qualifications and significant debt. What we had to do when we were elected to government—like we do on so many occasions—was step in and clean up Labor's legacy.
