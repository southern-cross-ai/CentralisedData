        My question is to my distinguished colleague from Queensland Senator Brandis, in his capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Will the minister advise the Senate of the importance the Howard government attaches to the promotion of the study of Australian literature in Australian schools and universities? What initiatives is the government taking to promote the study?

         I thank Senator Trood for his question and acknowledge the serious interest that he has displayed in this important issue for as long as he has been a member of the Senate and indeed before. Like Senator Trood, I am the parent of secondary school age children and like most Australian parents, I think, we share a concern at the evident decline in emphasis on literary studies in general and the study of Australian literature in particular in Australian schools. Too often, I am sorry to say, that decline has been driven by ideologically obsessed teachers unions and state education departments enslaved by postmodernism and corrupted by cultural relativism, which sneer at the notion that our greatest literature is a priceless heritage. The editorial writer of the
         <i>

         newspaper last Thursday I thought captured the problem very well—

            . Texts are no longer studied to reveal their moral or aesthetic value, they are “unpacked” or “decoded” to expose perceived racism, sexism and the exploitation of “victims” by the hegemonic classes. This ideological approach means that even if students do study anything from the canon of great literature it is through the jaundiced eye of left-wing politics, turning a deaf ear to the musicality of language or the aesthetics of beauty. It is extraordinary that at a time when young people feel more freedom to express open pride in their Australian identity they are not being exposed to what our greatest writers and poets have to say about being Australian.

               the incomparable Mr Imre Salusinszky. On that occasion, Minister Bishop announced that the Australian government would donate $1.5 million to the endowment of a new chair in Australian literature at an Australian university to be chosen. The roundtable made a number of recommendations, which the government is looking at very closely. Those recommendations included:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The study of literature should form a core element of English courses in schools, introduced in the primary years and developed at secondary level;
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Nationally consistent curricula and core standards, which are currently being developed by education ministers, should include a component on Australian literature;
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               This component should be included in any external assessment;
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               There should be a comparative investigation of international models of literary education;
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Literacy and Numeracy Week should have a greater emphasis on Australian literature;
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The recently announced summer schools for teachers—along with other aspects of the Australian Government Quality Teacher Programme—should include an emphasis on Australian literature;
              </p>
