        My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister representing the Minister for Trade. Minister, did you see a press release yesterday from the Australian Grain Exporters Association stating that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Wheat Export Authority
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        International are stonewalling on wheat export permits to Iraq? Did the minister note that members of that association sent bulk wheat export permit applications to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEA" rel="nofollow">
         WEA
        </a>
        two weeks ago but claimed they are yet to receive a constructive response despite numerous follow-ups? What is the government doing to ensure that the WEA and AWB International respond promptly to export permit applications, giving full reasons for their decisions?

         I thank Senator Murray for the question. The matter that Senator Murray raises is a very important issue for the grain growers of Australia. It certainly is the case that this government has been concerned to ensure that the grain growers of Australia are able to take advantage of being able to sell their wheat in appropriate markets. It has been the basis for the visit to Iraq of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, and others. Through this visit, the efforts of the Deputy Prime Minister and, I might say, Senator Ferris, who accompanied him, we have ensured that Iraq will continue to deal with Australia on an appropriate basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The matter of the exports and being able to now put in place appropriate contracts is a matter that is obviously under very close consideration. It is not appropriate for me to pre-empt every nuance of what is going on in these negotiations, except to say that this government is committed to the wheat growers of Australia, and we will ensure that we stand up for them and look after them so they are able to take advantage of appropriate contracts with Iraq.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, I regret that that was not a satisfactory response, so let us try again. Unless this mess is resolved in the short to medium term, is it not necessary to change the enabling legislation urgently, firstly, to require a response with reasons in writing in a designated and reasonably short time and, secondly, shouldn’t the act—
