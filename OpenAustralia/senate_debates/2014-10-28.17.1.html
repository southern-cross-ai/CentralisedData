        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. Can the minister update the Senate on Australia's contribution to the international effort to disrupt and degrade the operations of Daesh, also known as ISIL, in Iraq? What work has been undertaken by the

        </a>
        to assist the Iraqi government and the coalition of 60 other nations involved in this effort?

         -30A air-to-air refueller has flown 24 missions delivering fuel to Australian and coalition aircraft. These missions have been supported by our Wedgetail early warning command and control aircraft, which plays a vital role coordinating all coalition aircraft. It has conducted 19 missions, accruing 230 flying hours. The CDF has been providing a number of operational updates and has been sensible and judicious with this information to protect our people, but has advised the coalition has the strategic momentum. The adverse effects of air strikes on ISIL are numerous. Apart from degrading ISIL's capabilities, they are affecting their access to revenue, their ability to move freely and resupply their people. Air strikes by the coalition are also having a broader impact on morale and confidence and the notion that ISIL or Daesh is invincible. These air strikes are continuing to make an impact. I want to pause to congratulate our Defence personnel on their superb efforts inside Iraq. I congratulate them.

           On 18 and 19 October, my friend and colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop travelled to Iraq and finalised the legal arrangements for the deployment of Australian special forces to advise and assist the Iraqi security forces. Defence is now working closely with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
            DFAT
           </a>
           and other government agencies to meet the administrative requirements and the mechanics to implement the legal arrangements that have been negotiated. Once these are in place, they will pave the way for the deployment of our special forces. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Defence Force
           </a>
           takes force protection issues extremely seriously and is developing appropriate measures to mitigate the risks to its operations and the deployment of our people into Iraq. Our special forces are currently positioned in Australia's main base in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
            Middle East

           and are ready to assist the Iraqi security forces to prepare and plan for operations. We want to ensure this is done properly. We do not want to cut corners; and here we are focused on the detail and the prudence going forward.

             . Nations contributing to air strikes alongside Australia in Iraq include: the United States—obviously—the United Kingdom, Denmark, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Other nations are participating in air strikes in Syria. The coalition of nations are all in Iraq at the invitation and request of the Iraqi government, and it is the Iraqi government that is coordinating these operations.
