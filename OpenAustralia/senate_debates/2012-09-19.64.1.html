        I rise today to outline what I consider to be the latest example of the extortion schemes that are ruining Australian industry. Hardworking primary producers in a growing range of industries are being duped into believing that by working with the environmental groups their long-term future is assured. The reality is very different.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last May in Rockhampton, at Beef Australia 2012, Queensland cattle farmers had a very rude awakening. They were meeting the members of the Australian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, the ARSB, to discuss plans to improve the industry's sustainability practices. The ARSB members included
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS" rel="nofollow">
         JBS
        </a>
        , Cargill,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's" rel="nofollow">
         McDonald's
        </a>
        , the Cattle Council of Australia, Meat &amp; Livestock Australia and AgForce. But there was one organisation present that stunned many in the crowd—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wildlife_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         World Wildlife Fund
        </a>
        , or WWF, and its ARSB representative Rob Cairns.
       </p>
       <p>
        The World Wildlife Fund is the same group that waged a campaign against the land and regrowth clearing practices of Queensland farmers. The resulting vegetation management laws crippled the cattle industry yet the WWF called the laws disappointing and campaigned for even tighter restrictions. If any grazier familiar with the WWF's role in that campaign thinks it is now acting in the best interest of the cattle industry then they believe in the tooth fairy.
       </p>
       <p>
        What must be understood is that the ARSB is part of the worldwide coordinated campaign by the World Wildlife Fund and others to squeeze primary industry dry under the pretence of sustainability. In Australia, these green groups have gone from the timber sector, to the seafood sector, to the sugar sector, dragging farmers into expensive, time-consuming certification schemes. These schemes have made the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
         NGO
        </a>
        s a tidy profit but have done almost nothing for industry or the environment. Make no mistake, this is a backdoor method used by clever extreme greens to cripple primary industry. Sustainability here is a cover word for suicide by any business silly enough to fall for the siren song of these radicals.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WWF" rel="nofollow">
         The WWF
        </a>
        has set its sights on the beef industry. On one hand, the President of AgForce, Brent Finlay, agrees with me that graziers should run a hundred miles from the ARSB. But then there is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Director
        </a>
        of the Cattle Council of Australia, David Inall, who has said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you're not at the table, you're on the menu.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inall thinks that if beef industry stakeholders keep an eye on the WWF at the ARSB meetings, they can be spared the mandatory regulations the WWF has inflicted on other primary sectors. I say that if you think associating with the WWF will leave the cattle industry better off then you are totally wrong. Consider Ian McConnel, a beef producer and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCA" rel="nofollow">
         CCA
        </a>
        's 2011 Rising Champion. He was seemingly the perfect person for the WWF to appoint as its sustainable beef project coordinator. Graziers would more likely trust his claim that the WWF is on their side and that the ARSB is good for them. They might take his word, but in a recent interview with
        <i>
         Queensland Country Life
        </i>
        , he said: 'There has been some press saying we are going to bring in certain standards, but we are still at the stage of incorporating the round table and getting everyone together. We are not at the stage yet of having a definition of sustainability.' Well, the question has got to be asked now: at what stage will you have a definition of sustainability, and will it be mandatory? McConnel's very job description by WWF states his key responsibilities are 'helping to define sustainable beef production practices' and 'ensuring the development and widespread adoption of sustainable industry practices.'
       </p>
       <p>
        At an early ARSB meeting, the WWF's Rob Cairns was delegated the role of developing a definition of 'sustainable beef'. This definition will be crucial in shaping the final sustainable beef plan and the resulting fallout in the cattle industry. McConnel, David Inall and the rest say WWF is not the policeman of the ARSB process. But WWF has dominated the Australian sustainable beef process since as far back as November 2010, when it co-hosted the ARSB's forebear, the Global Conference on Sustainable Beef in Denver, Colorado. Then the Chairman of the ARSB, Guy Fitzhardinge—he is a governor of WWF-Australia—enlisted a push to their green agenda in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The WWF admits in this process it has needlessly hurt the cattle industry with its militant activities of the past, based more on emotion than science. It is now asking for a second chance through this fully consultative ARSB process. However, there is documented proof WWF is working behind the scenes against the industry. Just last month, WWF-Australia made two submissions to Queensland parliamentary committee inquiries savagely denigrating the cattle industry's sustainability record and unfairly accusing it of polluting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        . So the WWF is publicly saying producers can trust them and that it is fully accountable to its ARSB industry partners, yet it has submitted two documents to parliament, with no industry consultation, saying compulsory standards must be implemented or beef producers will continue to pollute the reef with impunity. The deception is staggering.
       </p>
       <p>
        They have said any certification process will be voluntary. This is more deceit. Once producers enter into these WWF-controlled schemes, they will be forced to make ongoing payments to obtain and keep certification while being subject to increasingly strict regulations. The certification rules will drive up their operating costs while reducing the purchasing power of their customers. If a producer attempts to back out of the scheme, the WWF and other
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs" rel="nofollow">
         NGOs
        </a>
        will lobby the public against them. These actions are secondary boycotts, where a legitimate supplier of product is attacked by ranting protesters who are concerned about somebody else involved in the supply chain. Worse, this will all be for nothing. Beef production methods have been sustainable for many years, but the WWF will persist until it has left the cattle industry in the same place as our seafood industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our fisheries have been assessed by experts as some of the best managed and most sustainable in the world. Any claims otherwise can be traced back to scare campaigns waged by green groups, who continue to push the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Stewardship_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Marine Stewardship Council
        </a>
        ecolabel on fisheries and retailers. The Marine Stewardship Council is an organisation that was founded by the WWF. They won a big victory last year when Coles announced it would not stock any seafood without taking sustainability advice from the WWF, and on the same day Woolworths announced it would source seafood products through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC" rel="nofollow">
         MSC
        </a>
        . Both Coles and Woolworths said they would provide financial incentives to fisheries that sign up to the MSC pre-assessment process. It appears the schemes are voluntary, but given Coles' and Woolworths' overwhelming market share, many fishery owners have no choice but to sign up in order to sell their product.
       </p>
       <p>
        An example of the huge costs involved in these certification schemes is Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPF" rel="nofollow">
         NPF
        </a>
        . The NPF moves most of its banana prawns through Woolworths. The Northern Prawn Fishery signed up for MSC pre-assessment in mid-2011 to please its biggest customer. The cost of the pre-assessment process for the NPF is around $100,000. The Northern Prawn Fishery is now in the final stages of a full MSC assessment. This has lasted over a year. Fisheries undergoing MSC assessment must hire additional staff and spend an endless amount of time and resources to provide information to the MSC certifiers. Even then they are not guaranteed certification. The costs do not stop there. If a fishery obtains certification, it must cover the costs of annual audits and any additional audits a certifier can choose to conduct at any time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Companies further up the chain who are urged to use the MSC ecolabel will have to pay a licence fee to use it and for chain of custody certification which links their products back to the certified fishery. After that, retailers, restaurants and fish and chip shops wishing to sell MSC labelled products to consumers must pay an annual fee and royalties at 0.5 per cent of the value of the seafood sold.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another costly and complex certification scheme favoured by WWF is the international sugar certification scheme Bonsucro. Some sugar growers have turned to Bonsucro to counteract unjustified attacks by green groups. Bonsucro requires supply chain members to comply either with production standards or standards for chain of custody certification. This is the same as the Marine Stewardship Council model. WWF is treating our primary industries as nothing more than a cash cow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Stewardship_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Forest Stewardship Council
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSC" rel="nofollow">
         FSC
        </a>
        model, to extort forestry companies into that particular certification method. After years of proper assessment, FSC will change the goal posts again. One extraordinary element of FSC is the banning of exports from any forests planted since 1994 in Tasmania, which accounts for more than half of the total available for sustainable logging right now. The forestry industry has come under attack via secondary boycotts that have been waged by green groups. I point to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Norman" rel="nofollow">
         Harvey Norman
        </a>
        , an Australian company which has committed no crime except to sell furniture made from wood legally logged from Australian forests, set aside for exactly that purpose after lengthy and proper consultation. Yet this company's stores have been bombarded by activists calling for customers to walk out, purely because those customers might want to buy a product that these greens do not like.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many examples of this sort of behaviour going on right now. The union movement cannot legally engage in these sorts of unfair secondary boycotts, and I believe it is time we looked at preventing others from doing the same. The coordinated campaign of WWF and other NGOs to coerce Australian industries into certification schemes is so commonplace it has spawned the term 'greenmail'.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Wilson
        </a>
        from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Public_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Institute of Public Affairs
        </a>
        put out an eye-opening report last year,
        <i>
         Naked extortion? Environmental NGOs imposing involuntary regulations on consumers and business
        </i>
        which I encourage everyone to read. That outlines the greenmail tactics of WWF and other green groups. He goes into great detail about how these groups use good cop, bad cop tactics to pressure producers and companies into costly and complex certification schemes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge all industry members of the beef roundtable and any other roundtables presided over by the WWF to pull out. Every time you show up to a meeting, you are adding to the public credibility of green extremists. You are giving them the power to tell consumers and retailers which of your products they should and should not buy. This will only lead to an ongoing income stream for WWF year after year, paid for out of your own pockets. WWF will not stop until it has inflicted sustainability standards upon every last one of our agricultural sectors. By engaging with them, you are only hoisting yourself with your own petard.
