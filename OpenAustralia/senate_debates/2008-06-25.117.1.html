        , I present report No. 5 of 2008,

       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        has reported on an exception only basis on issues that it thought warranted further comment and in some cases recommendation for further action. However, many more issues were raised at the public hearings and I would urge those interested in any of these works to supplement the report with the transcripts and submissions available on the Committee’s website.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In all cases, the Committee has recommended that the House resolve that the works be carried out. For two of the seven works, the Committee has made additional recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        En the case of the Edinburgh Defence Precinct Development, the Committee has recommended that the Minister for Defence progress land acquisition negotiations as a matter of priority. This land under question will enhance the Army’s training capacity and any expenditure on temporary facilities whilst awaiting this acquisition would be wasted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Secondly, the Committee has made a general recommendation that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        contracts for major capital infrastructure developments include a requirement for the provision of employment and training opportunities for the local community. The Committee considers that Commonwealth agencies delivering capital works projects have an obligation to contribute to the local community by ensuring these opportunities are provided.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Concerns of the local community were also raised in the inquiry into developments at Robertson Barracks, Darwin. Local residents expressed concern about the impact of base traffic on local roads. Although this is the responsibility of the local government, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        indicated it was keen to resolve the concerns of residents and thus the Committee has recommended that Defence facilitate a resolution to this issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, the Multi-role Helicopter facilities project highlighted concerns about residential housing development encroaching on Defence establishments and the resulting restrictions that this places on Defence activities. The Committee has recommended that the Government negotiate with relevant State, Territory and local governments to develop protocols to manage development on land surrounding Defence establishments. While the Committee understands that residential land is at a premium, it does not want essential Defence activities to be retrospectively curtailed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , I would like to thank the Committee for its work in relation to these inquiries. The Committee was aware that several of these projects had been delays due to the prorogation of the 41st Parliament so went to great lengths to ensure they were completed by this sitting period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
