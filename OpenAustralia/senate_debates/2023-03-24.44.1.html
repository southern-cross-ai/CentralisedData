        The Labor government want to destroy faith based schooling, and they have engaged the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Law_Reform_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Law Reform Commission
        </a>
        , through its recent consultation paper entitled
        <i>
         Religious Education Institutions and Anti-Discrimination Laws
        </i>
        , to start the next campaign against faith based institutions. If adopted into law, these proposals will (1) require the state to decide what is legitimate religious practice, (2) require faith institutions to allow the teaching of matters in complete opposition to their views, and (3) give the state the power to investigate faith based schools. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        wants the state to control every aspect of your life, including your right to choose your child's schooling. The proposals raised by the ALRC aim a dagger at the heart of independent education and bell the cat regarding this Labor government's true intentions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the last few years, all around the country, the leftists who control our parliaments have waved through reams of egregious legislation, such as the erroneously named 'conversion therapy laws'. They want to elevate and promote modern cults like the unhinged climate and COVID cults. The proposals presented here have the potential to establish and strengthen Marxist beliefs in our schools while compromising your ability to provide your children with an education aligned with your principles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't think this is just about schools. The ALRC has recommended expanding these reforms to all religious organisations in the future. To those who hold dear the principles of freedom of religion, association, and speech, I say: wake up. These people are coming for you, and you are asleep at the wheel.
