        On 22 March 2007, Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Fielding
        </a>
        asked a question in relation to private equity. I undertook to obtain further information in relation to

         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        ’s question from the Treasurer. I seek leave to incorporate this information in

        The answer read as follows—

       <p class="italic">
        Senator FIELDING (2.34 p.m.)—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Treasurer. Minister, I draw your attention to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        government’s recent announcement of an inquiry into the loss of tax revenue caused by high-debt private equity buyouts. Minister, given that Australian taxpayers will lose more than $1 billion in revenue as a result of the Qantas takeover, will the Australian government also investigate the massive tax losses from such deals?
       </p>

        Senator Minchin—The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the Senator’s question:

        It should be noted that any revenue reductions flowing from private equity buy-outs may be offset by revenue gains flowing from the sale of shares and reinvestment of sale proceeds.

        Senator FIELDING—Why has the Government agreed to tax treaties which limit our tax take on money going overseas to just 10 per cent?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Minchin—The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the Senator’s question:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The general rate of withholding tax on interest paid to non-residents is 10 per cent on the gross interest paid. This is also the rate that is sought in Australia’s tax treaties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A tax treaty provides for a balanced outcome whereby both countries are required to limit their taxing rights on cross-border interest payments. Thus Australia’s treaty partner countries must also limit their taxation on interest paid to Australian residents to 10 per cent. This treaty practice is in line with international norms, as set out in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        ’s Model Tax Convention. If Australia did not take such an approach to tax treaties, the taxation arrangements for Australian businesses operating overseas would not be as beneficial. This would lessen the international competitiveness of Australian owned and based businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A tax of 10% on the gross amount of interest could often amount to more than a 30% (the corporate tax rate) tax on the net income, as tax on gross flows does not allow deductions for expenses incurred by the non-resident in earning that interest income in Australia.
