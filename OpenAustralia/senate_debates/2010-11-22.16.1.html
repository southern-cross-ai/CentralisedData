        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy and it is regarding the gas hub development of Woodside at James Price Point in the Kimberley. Is it true that the retention lease given by the Commonwealth and the state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        was conditional primarily on the plant being at James Price Point unless a site could be found where the development could go ahead quicker on a commercially viable basis?

          , on a point of order—yes, it is a very early intervention here: there is a minute and 43 seconds left, and I did not ask for background on this particular matter; I asked for an answer to the question about the conditions of the lease. I want the minister to answer that question.

           , on the point of order: the minister made it clear to Senator Brown that he would come to the specifics of the question but he sought to put it in the context in which he chose to frame the answer. I think it is quite reasonable for him to do that and, given that he had only gone about 17 seconds, it is totally inappropriate for people to take points of order when the minister has indicated quite clearly he intended to answer the question.

            Two minutes are allocated for the answering of questions in question time. Only 17 seconds have elapsed, as was rightfully pointed out. The minister has a minute and 43 seconds remaining to answer the question. I draw the minister’s attention to the question.

                That is what I was intending to do because I am trying to assist senators and I am trying to assist the many people who watch Senate question time. I could give them some very basic information and answer Senator Brown’s question. We would have got there a lot earlier—we would have got there 33 seconds ago—if it had not been for the point of order 17 seconds into my question.

                    Senator Brown, unfortunately people quite wrongly interjected during your question. I drew the minister’s attention to the question. I also drew attention to the fact that the minister at that stage had only been going for 17 seconds. The minister should address the question and should ignore interjections, which are completely disorderly, during question time.

                     Now I have been going for 93 seconds and I still have not got to the very basis of the question. The Browse Basin gas reserves are a very significant gas deposit in a world-class gas province. The gas will be processed and brought onshore from the field at James Price Point. My advice, Senator Brown, is that on 9 February 2010 the Browse joint venture partners, Woodside,

                       As I was saying—and I have described the joint venture partners—on 9 February the partners agreed the selection of James Price Point as the location to process the gas from the venture’s Browse Basin gas fields subject to necessary approvals and consents. As to your claim—there is a claim in your question—I certainly do not have any brief before me. As the representational minister, I will take the details of your question on notice, refer it to my colleague and obtain a response to your claims. I would point out that there is a dispute at the present time between the

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. The lease answers the question: the minister did direct the proponents to have this project at James Price Point unless they could show a commercially viable alternative, which was not to be the case. I ask the minister: what is the point of the Commonwealth undertaking to protect national environmental and social values, including those of the Indigenous people of this country, if it so directs—

My ministerial colleague may have read the lease, but I certainly have not read the lease, Senator Brown, so I am not aware of its contents. I will take on notice whether your interpretation—your view—of the meaning of the lease is correct. I do not know, but I will take that on notice for you.
