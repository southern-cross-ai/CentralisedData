         bushfires were one of the most devastating natural disasters we've seen in our nation's history. In such a time of desperation and loss, Australians came together to do whatever they could to assist these affected communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government is committed to standing side by side with communities as they recover from these devastating bushfires. Through the National Bushfire Recovery Fund and other bushfire recovery systems we have provided support to address immediate recovery needs. To date, $2.8 billion of Commonwealth support has been made available for recovery and 85 per cent of that has been delivered. This includes $1.7 billion delivered from the National Bushfire Recovery Fund, supporting locally-led efforts on the ground, because we know that locals know what's best for their community. Significant immediate assistance has been provided, including: nearly 5,000 bushfire damaged and destroyed properties being cleared; over 200,000 disaster recovery payments being made to individuals; over 88,000 payments of $400 made to assist with back-to-school expenses for families; over 27,000 grants and loans provided to small businesses and primary producers; and financial assistance provided to 3,200 volunteer firefighters. Of the numerous programs included under the National Bushfire Recovery Fund, one of the largest is the $700 million Local Economic Recovery Program being delivered in partnership with state governments. Nearly 400 successful projects have been announced to date, with more to come. In your home state of New South Wales, up to $2.4 million will construct a new multipurpose community facility in the

         new visitor information and community centre. The facility will deliver additional services to the local community.

            Bushfire Recovery Grants Program builds on measures implemented by the government over the past 18 months to support disaster response relief and recovery in bushfire affected areas. Projects can be funded between $20,000 and $10 million for community organisations, local councils and businesses. This program will help bushfire impacted communities build back better and funds a lot of those recovery and resilience projects. Amounts identified for each eligible local government area in the grant guidelines are a guide. They are not fixed or capped. I want to make that very, very clear: the size of the local government area is not a limiting factor under this program. A committee chaired by the coordinator-general of the NRRA will undertake a detailed assessment of the applications based on and merit. It will then come to me as the final decision-maker.

               Australians are too familiar with the devastation caused by natural disasters, such as bushfires, floods and droughts. These types of events are inevitable. Many hazards are becoming more frequent and intense. We are progressing towards a much more resilient and prepared country, and the Liberals and Nationals in government are driving a comprehensive program of measures in partnerships with states and territories to realise the outcomes of the National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework and increase that resilience of Australian communities. The framework outlines a coordinated approach to reducing disaster risk and its implementation will be supported by the First National Action Plan. The Australian and state governments have committed $261 million over the next five years to work out the priorities of the framework and, in addition, the Australian Climate Service, comprising of the
