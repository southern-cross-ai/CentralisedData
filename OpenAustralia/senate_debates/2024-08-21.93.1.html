        Mr Carroll added fuel to the fire in an ongoing Labor vs Labor stoush over funding for public schools on Wednesday, applauding the former Coalition government for increasing funding to state schools. In a brutal takedown, he also called on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to "beat what Turnbull did" … "

        was prime minister, they increased public school education from 17 per cent to 20 per cent and that's a conservative government … Asked to clarify whether the previous Coalition government had done a better job at funding public schools, Mr Carroll replied: "Yes."

        This school funding war is absolutely a mess of Labor's own making.

        Prime Minister Albanese went to the election promising full and fair funding, despite the fact the Commonwealth is fully meeting its 20 per cent funding contribution to government schools under the Gonski funding model, but, in an act of apparent hypocrisy by state Labor, a short time ago I met with a teacher from Oberon Primary School, and they still need their roof fixed.
