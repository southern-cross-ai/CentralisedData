         (5) Resettlement was identified as a risk during AusAID's routine and comprehensive assessment process for the Project. On joining the project partnership in late 2009, AusAID assessed the project's resettlement plan which was updated and approved by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADB" rel="nofollow">
          ADB
         </a>
         and the Government of Cambodia in 2009. A risk management matrix was developed by AusAID outlining mitigation strategies. These strategies included that an independent monitor be in place to ensure that the project's resettlement plan be implemented by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Government_of_Cambodia" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Government of Cambodia
         </a>
         as intended fairly and without delay (in accordance with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Asian Development Bank
         </a>
         's international resettlement policy). In addition, AusAID agreed to finance an external international resettlement adviser to make monitoring visits to resettlement sites, produce independent reports and provide advice to the Cambodian Government, the ADB and AusAID on the implementation of the resettlement plan and the resolution of any complaints.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) AusAID has monitored resettlement since the project began. The AusAID funded resettlement expert visited the Battambang resettlement site in April 2010 and identified actions that were required prior to resettlement commencing in late May. The expert visited the Battambang resettlement site again in July 2010. During this visit, the community raised concerns about inadequate services which were conveyed to ADB and AusAID. On 5 August 2010, a monitoring mission report signed by AusAID, ADB and staff from the Cambodian Government formally raised the lack of services at the Battambang site as a concern. The Cambodian Government was asked to prepare a time-bound action plan in response by 31 August 2010. On 8 September 2010, ADB wrote to the Cambodian Government seeking an update on the provision of water and electricity at the site. Electricity has now been connected at the
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Battambang site and water is being provided by the Cambodian Government. A senior official from AusAID also visited the Battambang site in December 2010 to identify additional steps that need to be taken to ensure resettlement policies are adhered to. AusAID and ADB are working with the Cambodian Government to better manage the resettlement process for the whole of the railway project. The Cambodian Government has agreed to address all major actions recommended by the ADB and AusAID to improve resettlement for the project. This includes payment of compensation, additional monitoring, improved consultation and grievance processes and a requirement that adequate services are available at resettlement sites before people are relocated. A resettlement review mission was conducted by the ADB from 10 January to 3 February.
