        I will now deal with the Online Safety Bill 2021 and the Online Safety (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021. I will first deal with the second reading amendment moved by Senator Pratt in respect of the Online Safety Bill 2021 and then deal with the other circulated second reading amendments.

       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the Minister was slow in releasing the exposure draft of legislation for consultation then rushed the introduction of the bill into Parliament, eight business days after consultation on the exposure draft concluded, which undermined stakeholder confidence in the consultation process,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
