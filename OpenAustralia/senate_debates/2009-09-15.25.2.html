         I thank Senator Minchin for his question and for his 150th press release since he became shadow minister. There has not been one policy in the 150. It is an auspicious day today—150 press releases and not one single policy!

         The historic reforms that the government will introduce today will fundamentally reform existing telecommunications regulations in the interests of Australian consumers and businesses. They will drive future growth, productivity and innovation across all sectors of the economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         For years, telecommunications companies, industry experts and the regulator have been calling for fundamental reforms in telecommunications. In the past, these tough decisions have been avoided by governments of both persuasions. Regulatory reform is critical for the future of communications in Australia. It should have been done in the past, a fact acknowledged by the former Minister for Communications,

         and the Arts, Senator Coonan, who on 13 May 2008 conceded that, ‘More thought could have gone into a policy that would have separated the network.’ Senator Helen Coonan said that just last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, we are delivering historic reforms in Australia’s long-term national interest that will address Telstra’s high level of integration to promote greater competition and consumer benefits; streamline and simplify the competition regime to provide more certain and quicker outcomes for telecommunications companies; strengthen consumer safeguards—

           The premise of that question fails on two fronts. We are not forcing Telstra to structurally separate; we are putting forward a series of reforms, and Telstra have a choice. They have a choice about the path they want to take: they can sit on their existing assets—the decrepit, dying, old, copper network—or they can move into the future with the new mobile spectrum and the new applications and technologies that will bring. Telstra have the choice about how they want to proceed—

                 I am genuinely pleased that the shadow minister wants to talk about the share value of Telstra, because the share value of Telstra on the day that the former minister—now shadow minister—appointed Mr Sol Trujillo to manage Telstra was $5.30. There was $30 billion in value lost at various points due to the management and leadership of those opposite. The share price when Mr Trujillo left the country was $3.30. Two dollars per share—
