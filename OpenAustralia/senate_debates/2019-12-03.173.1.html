        I rise tonight to pay tribute to our media industry. In an environment where our democratic rights are under attack, where we are governed increasingly by spin rather than substance, and under a government with a growing culture of secrecy, a free and informed media is vital. Media organisations in Australia have long been concerned about threats to journalistic freedoms. Police raids on journalists' homes and offices, tighter laws—with the excuse of national security—and the proliferation of fake news are all having an impact on how our media can operate. It's worth reminding ourselves of this quote from the
        <i>

        The freedom of the press still furnishes that check upon government which no constitution has ever been able to provide.

       <p>
        Australia's Right to Know coalition has been formed by all of our major media outlets and many of our smaller operators. It has six key proposals for reforms that would strengthen rights and protections for public interest journalism:

       </ul>
       <p>
        As a former journalist, I'm passionate about supporting a free press that shines a light on matters we deserve to know about. We should take the time to recognise and celebrate the role and achievements of our media and media workers.

        I'd like to pay tribute to some of those who have been recognised by their peers and the wider industry and community recently. Last week in

        , Arrernte and Anangu woman Catherine Liddle, First Nations Media Australia is going from strength to strength as a peak body advocating for the growing sector. That development is highlighted by the annual awards, where the scope and professionalism of the industry is on display. The First Nations Media Lifetime Achievement Award went to the legendary Freda Glynn. Freda is a founder of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAAMA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Imparja television. She was recognised for her vision to deliver essential information and news to communities in all the Central Australian Aboriginal languages—something that remains in action today, with CAAMA going from strength to strength in the heart of Australia under CEO Karl Hampton. In presenting the award, First Nations Media Australia Chair Dot West thanked Freda for her leadership, acknowledging that it was CAAMA that inspired and guided many of the communities around Australia to establish their own media organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        John Macumba, a frequent collaborator with Freda and one of the first Indigenous voices on the air, was recognised with the First Nations Media Legend Award. Wayne Bynder received the Outstanding Contributor Award in recognition of over 40 years of igniting passion for broadcasting across the Kimberley and generously sharing his knowledge across the industry. I commend all those nominees and all the outstanding winners of the First Nations Media Awards and all those who attended. I encourage senators to go online, have a look at the winners and see the calibre of our First Nations media industry and workers from right across the country who gathered in Alice Springs for that event.

        I also want to specially mention and congratulate the journalists we have in the Northern Territory and thank them for the work they do in keeping government to account and telling stories for our audiences. We know times are tough in the media industry, with funding cuts and staff cuts. Journalists continue to do their job and in most cases do it well in this tough environment and against the odds. In that vein, I would like to congratulate the finalists and winners of the Northern Territory Media Awards, which were held in Darwin recently. ABC journalist

        Congratulations to everyone and thank you for your hard work. Again, I urge senators to go online and have a look at our Northern Territory media awards and the nominees and category winners. They are exceptional and I congratulate all those who not only entered but who worked diligently across the Northern Territory to tell the stories that matter, not only to the people of the Northern Territory but to Australia and the international community.

        I'd also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Katie Woolf. She's a commercial radio announcer. Katie is an outstanding broadcaster, I believe, in terms of delivering not only the much needed information but also the debates, certainly the challenging debates, and interviews that can be quite interrogating, as they should be, of people in representative positions, whether they're in government, local government, local businesses or the general community. She is an incredible broadcaster. Along with the recipients of the NT Media Awards, Katie Woolf, for her successes, took home the Brian White Award for radio journalism for a non-metro area at the

        on weekdays from 9 am on Mix 104.9. She's a voice for Territorians, making sure local issues get the coverage that they deserve. I'm certain that many, many senators and members from the House who have been to Darwin have had the chance of being interrogated by Katie Woolf up there in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I certainly congratulate her and all of those who stand in the media industry to keep us—the people in the Senate, in the House of Representatives, in local governments and in state governments—accountable and responsible to the people of our respective state and territory jurisdictions and the people of Australia. They uphold an important tool for effective democracy in our country.
