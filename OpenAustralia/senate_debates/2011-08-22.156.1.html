        . It would be remiss of me not to put on the record our thanks to you for the enormous contribution you have made not only to the coalition and to the Liberal Party but to the people of New South Wales and to the people of Australia. You have served this Senate and those in New South Wales with enormous distinction. You have been a wonderful mentor for many of us. You have been very generous in sharing your knowledge and experience and have given great advice. We wish you our very best for the years to come. We know many careers will be opened up for you to pursue and we wish you all the best. In particular, thank you for the enormous contribution you have made.

         senator, I am well aware of your work and commitment to the people of New South Wales and to your constituents. Also, as someone who has observed you as a minister and a cabinet member, I know that you have had a number of difficult and challenging portfolios. You have always put the interests of the government and the country first. On behalf of the government, I wish you well in your future endeavours.

          I thank all senators for their courtesy and their graciousness. I certainly wish the Senate all the very best in the important deliberations that will be before all of you. As I said before, it is with great regret that I made my decision, but I do thank the Senate very much and wish everybody very well for the future.
