        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs. Can the minister confirm that an application to fund a community safety initiative sponsored by the women of the Wadeye community in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        has been rejected by the National Community Crime Prevention Program? Wasn’t this application facilitated by the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in their capacity as the lead agency for the Wadeye
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        trial as a response to growing violence in the Wadeye community? Given the problems of violence that Wadeye has experienced in the past year—even in past weeks—why wasn’t the funding granted? Was the application rejected because of Minister Brough’s ban on any new Commonwealth funding for the Wadeye community? Why are the victims of violence at Wadeye now being punished by this government?

         I preface my answer by dealing with the process that applies to the National Community Crime Prevention Program—that is, applications are submitted to the Attorney-General’s Department and are assessed by the department. They then go to an independent committee which advises the minister, which is me, and a decision is made. I am aware of the Wadeye application and I am aware of the rejection, as mentioned by Senator Crossin. I will take the question on notice and get back to Senator Crossin. I may well offer her a private briefing on the matter, which may allay her concerns. I will either give her that briefing or come back and advise the Senate. I am not in the habit of discussing the merits or otherwise of individual applications.

          I know there is some comment coming from those opposite, but I think that in this case we should just be careful, and I plan to do that. I will take the question on notice.

           I hear what the minister has to say but I do have a supplementary question,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
            Mr President
           </a>
           . It goes to whether or not the minister can confirm that the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs intervened to prevent the grant of funding to Wadeye under the National Community Crime Prevention Program. If the government really is concerned about violence at Wadeye, why has it not acted to support this funding and support the women of that community to do something to stop it?

            This is not underplaying the importance of the issue that Senator Crossin raises, but I think my previous remarks apply—that is, I will take this on notice and either advise the Senate after I have taken advice or look at the possibility of giving Senator Crossin a private briefing.
