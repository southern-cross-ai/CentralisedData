         Liberal Party of Australia
        </a>
        , you were a member of the division's executive committee at the time that the then state director, Mr Damien Mantach, fraudulently misused his Liberal Party credit card, for which he was effectively sacked? When this issue became public a few weeks ago, why did you mislead the Australian people by claiming that the issue was one for the Tasmanian Liberal Party organisation, when in fact you were a part of that organisation by virtue of your membership of the executive committee? Exactly what were you trying to hide? Finally, you have admitted that you were briefed at the time—I note that he is a bit uncomfortable over there,

         Order on my right and my left! Before I call the minister to respond, Senator McKim, most of that question is not in order because it does not necessarily relate to policy portfolio positions or the minister's representative responsibilities. However, I will invite the minister to answer any portion of that question that he wishes to answer.

           Senator McKim, that 'personal or representative capacity' means personally as a minister or representing another minister. I stand by my original ruling that that question is not in order. However, I will invite the

            I think the Senate today has been provided with a window into the roaring success that Mr McKim was as leader of the Greens in Tasmania, when his party representation was decimated by 40 per cent. I issued a statement in relation to this matter, I think it was on either 27 or 28 August, and I have nothing further to add.

             <p class="italic">
              No sum of money was mentioned.

              They are direct quotes from you. Are those statements admissions of your complete incompetence and your wilful ignorance or are you lying to the Tasmanian and Australian people about your level of knowledge at the time?

                As is the want, unfortunately, of a number of people on that side of the chamber, Senator McKim has only quoted part of that which was in the public statement that I issued. If Senator McKim had read the full extent of it into the

                record, he would not have made those unfortunate personal reflections, which he is a master of doing. I know that the Greens like to hand it out to everybody else and then squeal when anybody ever says anything about their motives. I simply say that I made a full statement in relation to this matter and I have nothing further to add.

                 , I ask a further supplementary question. I would preface my question by observing that it is not over just because the senator says that it is. Senator Abetz, do you accept responsibility for exposing the Victorian division of the Liberal Party to the loss of $1.5 million at Mr Mantach's hands? How could you possibly think that it was a good idea not to tell your colleagues in Victoria about Mr Mantach? Will you now apologise to them and their members for treating them like mushrooms?
