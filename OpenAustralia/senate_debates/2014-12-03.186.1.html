        Today, 3 December, is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of People with Disability. The minister for disabilities has given me a badge to wear to advertise and celebrate this day. The badge reads: '3rd of December marks International Day of People with Disability, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        sanctioned day that unites people around the world in celebrating the achievements and contributions of people with disability.' I wholeheartedly agree with this day and acknowledge the important valuable contribution that people with disabilities give to the world, Australia and the state of Tasmania because, after an injury and a long battle with government bureaucracy, I also carry a disability—depression, and I have had to learn to cope with that—along with a back injury.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of that experience of being down and out for many years, I have made the decision to give people with disabilities who are suitably qualified a fair go when it comes to employing staff. The problem I have is that the Abbott government have obstructed and hindered me at every stage when I have tried to employ people with disabilities. They did it once when I tried to hire a former commando who suffered a brain injury after he was blown up in Afghanistan when serving his country and tonight I have to report to the Senate that the Liberal government have done it again. Despite all the policies, badges and fine speeches, Mr Abbott could not give a damn about people with disabilities. I say that with confidence because once again I have tried to employ a person with a disability and once again this government has failed to allow some reasonable workplace adjustments to ensure that this person is employed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I refer to my senior policy advisor Ms Barber, a person who is living with a disability and whose personal circumstances I am now forced to bring before this Senate because I have run out of options. The government, according to Senator Ronaldson, wants her unemployed tomorrow. The bizarre thing about my argument over my staff choice with Mr Abbott is that I can, with the travel arrangements I am requesting for Ms Barber, save the Commonwealth government about $5,000 per year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I did not want to have to put Ms Barber thought this public scrutiny. As a high-profile health whistleblower she has already been through enough, but both Ms Barber and I agree that this government, Prime Minister and Special Minister of State should be exposed for the frauds and hypocrites that they really are when it comes to employing and making reasonable workplace adjustments for people with disabilities.

         Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Lambie has just reflected on a member of this place and a member of the other place. It is unparliamentary language and it should be withdrawn.

             Ms Barber's professional skills are unique and have already benefited the people of Tasmania in many different ways, which I will describe in more detail in the future I am sure. However, tonight the important point I need to make is that as a former police officer, a health ethical standards officer, an expert
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
              Supreme Court

             witness in workers comp matters as well as a chief medical board investigator Ms Barber has invaluable practical and legislative skills, which are rare to find in one person who is so easy and trustworthy to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because of all the injuries accumulated during her long history of distinguished public service Ms Barber now suffers from disabilities, which her

             and psychologist have confirmed in writing to our

             and Minister Ronaldson. Despite being informed of those injuries, our Prime Minister and Senator Ronaldson refuse to allow Ms Barber to work from a non-standard work location. In short, according to her doctors, the best way for Ms Barber to medically manage her disabilities is for her to live in Brisbane close to her family and her professional medical support team and commute to Canberra for Senate sitting weeks. This simple workplace adjustment for a person with a genuine disability is too much for our PM to agree to, especially on this
