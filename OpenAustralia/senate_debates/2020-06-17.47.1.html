        In recent weeks we've seen hundreds of thousands of Australians take to the streets to march and to call on the reduction that's necessary in black deaths in custody and, certainly, the high incarceration rates of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people. As a 19-year-old and 20-year-old, as a journalist for the ABC, I covered the royal commission into black deaths in custody, in particular in Darwin, and also the day when Elliott Johnston brought down the recommendations. We could then talk about the names of the 99 people who had died. At the time my colleague Senator Pat Dodson was one of the royal commissioners.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has been an incredible journey. Yet when we look at the deaths of over 437 or 438—possibly 439—Aboriginal people since then, we don't really know all of their names. I looked through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Criminology" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Criminology

        website and saw the statistics, but it is
        <i>
         The
        </i>
        <i>
         Guardian
        </i>
        Australia's Deaths Inside database that documents the names. They collected and analysed all available coronial data and other sources to build a searchable database of First Nations deaths in custody since 2008. So we certainly don't know the names of those who died between 1991, when the findings of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">

         Aboriginal Deaths in Custody

        were handed down, and 2008. As I said, the Australian Institute of Criminology has the statistics but we don't know the names of those people or the circumstances surrounding their deaths. They're just numbers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to take the time that I have now to mention as many names that I can and pay my respects to those families who are still seeking justice for their loved ones and wanting to know what has happened. On 29 March 2020, an unknown male, 30, was arrested and taken to Horsham police station, where his condition deteriorated. He was transported to hospital by ambulance, where he later died. On 21 March this year,

On 9 November 29, Mr Walker, 19, died after he was shot at Yuendumu when two police officers went to his house to arrest him for breaches of his suspended sentence. On 6 November 2019 an unknown male, 20, fell 10 metres to his death while being escorted from

On 11 February 2019, A Eades, 46, was allegedly attacked by other prisoners and found critically injured in his prison cell on 26 February 2019. He died in hospital 13 days later. His injuries included a broken neck, severe brain swelling and facial fractures and lacerations.

        These are the people that hundreds of thousands of Australians walked the streets for this week and last week, and they will no doubt continue to do so. We don't know some of the other names, or a lot of the other names, but we certainly pay our respects to those families still seeking justice, equality and fairness in our country. We must never stop the pursuit of justice, equality and fairness for all Australians, especially First Nations people.
