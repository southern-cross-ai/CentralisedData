        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. Minister, in your statement to the Senate on Tuesday, and repeatedly since that time, you've acknowledged you received information about Ms Higgins's sexual assault allegations but did nothing with that information—absolutely nothing—in advance of it being made public. But on Tuesday you couldn't, or wouldn't, answer questions about whether you provided feedback on

        interview, as has been widely reported. You've refused to explain whether you provided questions to Mr Sharaz, as his text messages suggest. You've avoided answering whether you communicated with any other person about questions to ask the former government. Minister, there are very straightforward answers to these questions. If it's true that you did nothing with the information, why can't you answer basic factual questions about your involvement in this matter?

The other point I would make is that when I give a commitment to someone around confidentiality I keep it. I don't breach confidentiality arrangements. I am prepared to withstand this line of questioning and the coverage from the media because I have—

           I'm happy to withdraw. But women do come to me raising concerns about sexual assault, sexual violence, sexual harassment, and one of the things I tell them is, 'Your confidence is safe with me.'

After the work that we have done on Jenkins, on Respect@Work, on asking women to come forward when something happens to them, to then treat women the way they are being treated right now—it says something about this. And I am sorry Senator Reynolds is clearly upset about what happened to her. I am sorry about that, and I told her that. I told her—

                   It's not interjection time. There are plenty of opportunities across the week for you to make whatever statements you want within the standing orders of the Senate. Question time is not one of them. I'm asking for respect in this chamber from both sides. Senator Watt, your constant interjections, quite frankly, are very unhelpful, as are those on my left. Minister, please continue.

                            had given an incorrect answer then I would correct that. I was making the point that I get a lot of invitations to a lot of things. If it wasn't in my role as chief minister but in another role then so be it. I did not attend the wedding; the invitation was declined. But I get thousands of invitations to things, and many of them I can't go to. I would just say again because the insinuation around the questioning today has been that we caused harm to Senator Reynolds or that that is what she feels, and so I would say that, when that was drawn to our attention—and it was—we took that on, and when we were asked to stand back from Senator Reynolds—
