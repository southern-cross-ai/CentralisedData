        It is important that all Australians participate in the postal survey on marriage equality, and I encourage voters to complete and post back the survey form as soon as they receive it so their views are counted. If the majority of Australians vote yes, the law will change by Christmas. I will be voting yes because the relationships of all Australians should be treated equally and fairly before the law. I will be voting yes because I want every person born in our great nation to know they will be able to marry the person they love. I want to say today to my fellow Australians: if you think that the love and commitment of your brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, friends and neighbours, work colleagues and teammates should be treated equally, join me in voting yes.

        Marriage equality requires a change to the law. But it's more than that. It's about very personal Australian stories. I have a 97-year-old constituent in Greenwich who was born when homosexuality was still considered a crime. He desperately wants the affirmation that will come when he can marry his life partner before family and friends. There is a dad in

        who wants to give his daughter the wedding he has given to his other children. There is a young gay man in Cammeray who simply wants the same opportunities as his mates. I will be voting yes for these Australians and so many more.

        We are a nation that prides itself on fairness and equality. Our laws should reflect these values, of which we are rightly proud. This can be a unifying moment for our nation, as our friends in democracies such as the United Kingdom,
