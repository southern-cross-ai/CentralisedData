       <p>
        We've all become used to the constant stream of opposition from the Liberals since the May election, but I have to say I was most surprised at the big 'no' that the Liberals are delivering to Australian manufacturers, businesses and innovators. We all know that they say they're the party of business and the party of economic growth, but now we have to ask: have they just given up? It surely seems so, because we know that Australian industry is behind the National Reconstruction Fund; they're backing the plans of this government. The Tech Council of Australia calls it 'a landmark investment in our nation's industrial and technological capability'. Those champions of collectivism at the Austrian Banking Association support the intention of the fund. And those well-known comrades at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG" rel="nofollow">
         KPMG
        </a>
        , those radical socialists, have stated that 'investment at this scale is a welcome move to protect a much-needed boost to Australia's innovation system'. How are those opposite actually on the opposite side to KPMG and the Banking Association? One would think that, after spending so much time crafting up a party persona based on being the party for big business, they'd actually listen to them, but no. We know we've got 'Cosplay Canavan' in the Senate, but now we have the pretend professionals over there and the mock manufacturers as well. A bit of free advice: listen to industry, listen to workers, listen to the Australian people who voted for the National Reconstruction Fund, and support this bill. It will create jobs in the cities, it will create jobs in the regions, and it will empower Aussie business to grow.
