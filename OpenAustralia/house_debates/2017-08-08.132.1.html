        One of the most important jobs for a member of parliament is to represent our most vulnerable people in society. For some time, I have been raising this issue and will continue to do so about older Australians who wish to remain in their own homes, with assistance from government packages. Some of these people have faced long delays in being assessed. Since 27 February, home care packages have been allocated directly to individuals, not to aged-care providers. People are now assessed as eligible for a certain level of the package. They then go into a national queue and wait for a package to become available. Packages can become available through either a new package being delivered by the government or perhaps someone vacating a package.
       </p>

        This issue was raised by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Byner" rel="nofollow">
         Leon Byner
        </a>
        on his program—for those of you who are aware of the Leon Byner 5AA talkback program—a few weeks ago and then again last week. Many callers rang his program and many stories were aired. Those people who called in were referred to me by his program in order for me to try to assist them. Some of the people who gave their stories said that they had been waiting up to 24 months for a package. Very often, after lengthy delays, people are offered a package at a much lower level of care than they are assessed for. For example, they could be assessed for a level 4 package, which is high-end need; there are none available, and they're given a level 2 package, which does not meet their needs. This is potentially dangerous and, frankly, not good enough. If you require needs that you are not getting, it defeats the purpose of keeping that person home, and eventually they end up in an aged-care facility.

        I've written to the minister, Mr Ken Wyatt, on behalf of a lot of those people that have contacted me. I know the minister has people's best interests at heart, because I've known him for some time, as have you, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons. We worked on the Health and Ageing Committee together. I am waiting to see if he can investigate each and every one. I also commend the minister for agreeing to go on the Leon Byner program and answer questions from some of those constituents that rang Leon's program. I know that, because of Leon Byner's intervention, the minister is going on tomorrow. I look forward to hearing what he has to say. We have written to him. I represent an electorate that has one of the oldest demographics in the country. As their representative, all I ask and strive for is to support these people as best we can. I want them to receive the support they need to live independently and fulfil their lives for as long as possible in their own homes.
