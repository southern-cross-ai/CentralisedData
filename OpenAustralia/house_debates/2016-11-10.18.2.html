        I would like to acknowledge the winners of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister's_Literary_Awards" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Minister's Literary Awards
        </a>
        announced this week. As someone who has given writing a go at various times and is the representative of an electorate with a strong literary and publishing heritage I want to recognise the sustained effort that is required to craft and tell important Australian stories. I would like to particularly mention Meg McKinlay, who won the young adult fiction category with her book,
        <i>
         A Single Stone
        </i>
        . Meg is a writer and poet from Fremantle who has made a significant contribution through her art. I also acknowledge Lisa Gorton, who won in the fiction category for her debut novel,
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life" rel="nofollow">
          The Life
         </a>
         of Houses
        </i>
        . Lisa is already an award-winning poet. She is a close family friend and the granddaughter of former Prime Minister Sir John Gorton.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also wonderful to see the great

        win the children's book prize for
        <i>
         Sister Heart
        </i>
        , a verse novel about the experiences of the stolen generations.
        <i>
         Sister Heart
        </i>
        was published by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Press" rel="nofollow">
         Fremantle Press
        </a>
        , which last week celebrated its 40th birthday. I was very happy to attend the celebrations with the member for Brand. I attended as the plus-one for my wife, Georgia, who is the fiction and nonfiction publisher at Fremantle Press.
       </p>
       <p>
        The birthday event doubled as an opportunity to announce this year's winner of the City of Fremantle
