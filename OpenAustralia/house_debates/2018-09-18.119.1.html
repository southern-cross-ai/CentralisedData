        I rise today to acknowledge the generosity of my local community during my recent winter appeal. Each winter, my office acts as a drop-off point for donations of food, beanies, scarves, blankets, toiletries and animal food. The donations go to vulnerable members of the local community who are struggling over the cooler months. This year, I've been absolutely overwhelmed by the generosity of our community.

        East Primary had an end-of-term drive for donations, including a 'wear your pyjamas to school' day, which raised extra money for the appeal. And the Ahmadiyya Muslim Women's Association brought in car loads of donations generously provided by members of their association. The residents of Moana Mews Retirement Village also generously put together donations.

Other local groups and organisations that donated included the 1st Reynella Scout Group; Aldinga Knitters and Hookers for Charity; Coorara kindy; The Cove Sports and Community Club; Cove Tigers Netball Club; 50 plus Activity Club from
