        In contrast to the members of the opposition, I would like to speak positively about what is happening in our country this afternoon. I would like to commend the Australian national soccer team, the Socceroos, on their fine effort in the World Cup this year. The Socceroos took on two of the world's powerhouses. They played the Dutch, whom they led 2-1—with that fine

        goal that will stick in our memories for a lifetime—before going down, and Chile, who took out Spain, the reigning world champions and current European champions. The Socceroos' performance was one of commitment and skill and demonstrated the fighting spirit that Australian teams demonstrate on the world stage. Greece also demonstrated a fighting spirit this morning by snatching a late winner and moving through to the next round for the first time in their history. I congratulate all other teams who had advanced in the World Cup.

        At a local level, I have witnessed many soccer teams and soccer clubs in my area who have demonstrated great local community commitment and spirit. The Adelaide Titans play on

        . Their chairman, Chris Haskas, took me through how their club has evolved. I went out and watched one of their games earlier this year and saw their spirit on the field. The Adelaide Olympic Football Club play at West Lakes Shore School and have a great junior program. We all know of the demand for soccer in our society and how schools are combining with the clubs to get a better facilities. I congratulate them on their fine efforts.
