       Dear Mr Murphy
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 22 November 2010 regarding the petition of residents of Goodooga and surrounds about downgrades and reductions to health and emergency services to the area provided by the New South Wales Greater Western Area Health Service (GWAHS) and Ambulance Service of New South Wales. As per Standing Order 209(b), I am providing a written response to you on the matters raised in the petition.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I note that the petition calls on the House to pressure the New South Wales Minister for Health, the Hon Carmel Tebbutt MP, and managerial staff of the GWAHS to secure the funding of its 24-hour emergency service and reinstate its ambulance service.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Australian Government is investing a record amount of up to $7.4 billion to implement the most significant reforms to health and hospitals since the introduction of Medicare. Under these reforms, the National Health and Hospitals Network will create a single national unified health system which is nationally funded and locally run to ensure all Australians have access to affordable and high quality health care. In September 2010, the Prime Minister, the Hon Julia Gillard MP, announced further investment through a new regional priority funding round of the Health and Hospitals Fund to improve health services to regional Australia.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       While the Commonwealth provides support and funding to the states and territories, the current management and delivery of health and hospital services rests with each state and territory government. Residents of Goodooga and surrounds may wish to raise their concerns formally with the New South Wales Minister for Health. The contact details are as follows:
