       <p>
        I rise on an issue affecting the tourism industry, particularly in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Douglas" rel="nofollow">
         Port Douglas
        </a>
        region in my electorate. It relates to the mishandling and apparent failure of the Tourism Exceptional Assistance Grant following the devastating impacts of Cyclone Jasper.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Cyclone Jasper hit, it left behind a trail of destruction that severely impacted on our local tourism businesses. On face value, the grant initiative that was received and was aiming to address the impacts felt by the effectiveness in tourism was very well received; however, the administration of these grants, particularly concerning our region's tourism accommodation providers, has been nothing short of a bureaucratic debacle.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's come to light that the applications from these accommodation providers, while initially appearing to be fully compliant with the requirements, now have been unjustly rejected. These are real businesses who are struggling. These are real families who were encouraged to apply, who have invested time, considerable effort and significant financial resources into a lengthy application process. The industry has repeatedly raised concerns about this, but they've been met with a total lack of empathy from the Queensland minister for tourism and member for Cairns,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Healy" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        You'd think that having a tourism minister based in your own electorate would be advantageous. Minister Healy has proven himself time and time again to be both an ineffectual member of parliament and certainly an incompetent minister. This isn't about ticking boxes or filling in forms; it's about delivering on a promise for those in dire need. It's about the survival of an industry that forms the backbone of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Far North Queensland
        </a>
        's economy. It's about supporting an industry that Minister Healy was once himself a part of for many years prior to his election to the Queensland parliament. Unfortunately, it's an industry he now appears to be content to turn his back on.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wrote to Minister Healy on 18 April requesting he intervene and review these claims by tourism accommodation providers. In his response to me, the only thing Minister Healy could do was deflect and blame his colleagues in the Albanese government for an overly restrictive application criteria. How about instead of looking for an opportunity to blame each other, you just get on with the job and fix the problem? There are many in the tourism accommodation industry in Port Douglas who are relying on this issue being resolved.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to call upon Minister Healy, his colleagues in the Albanese government and their respective departments to do the right thing: review the criteria, overturn these rejections and ensure that this support reaches those very businesses for which it was intended. They are desperately hoping to be able to receive it so that they can continue the magnificent work that they do in Far North Queensland.
