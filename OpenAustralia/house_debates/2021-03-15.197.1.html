        Throughout COVID-19, we have seen cases of mental health, domestic abuse and hardship skyrocket. Frequently, it is the case that our marginalised communities suffer most and the organisations that help those who have fallen through the cracks are put under even more pressure. It is a tragic fact that, although we live in one of the most beautiful areas in Australia, we have some of the highest rates of mental health problems in this country. I'm particularly touched by the work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Beaches" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Beaches
        </a>
        Women's Shelter in their efforts during our time of national crisis. The staff there acted with great dedication and were a stabilising force during our darkest days. When some of our communities' most vulnerable needed a helping hand, they stepped in. During this challenging time it was clear that on the Northern Beaches there are many unsung heroes. The honest truth is that those working at the Northern Beaches Women's Shelter are really the backbone of our community. They have helped countless numbers of people, often sacrificing so much in the process. These are truly selfless volunteers, motivated by a commitment to others. They do not engage in virtue signalling but prefer to get results by simply helping people. Their work frequently goes unrecognised, but the reality is, without these volunteers, the fallout from the pandemic would be significantly worse. It is only during times of hardship that our true values come to the fore. What I was proud to see was those timeless Australian values of mateship, helping one's neighbour and self-sacrifice come out.
