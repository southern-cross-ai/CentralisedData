        I rise today to congratulate Gympie Medical Transport, the Noosa Dolphins rugby club and the Maryborough Sporting Car Club on their successful applications to the Stronger Communities Program. As a regional representative, I know how much of a difference these grants make in Wide Bay's smaller communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gympie Medical Transport will receive $14,000 through the Stronger Communities Program, but their value to the community is far greater. This funding has helped them purchase a third vehicle so volunteers can take more people to their important medical appointments in Noosa, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        or Brisbaneâ€”people who might otherwise miss out on a specialist appointment or be forced to pay punishing amounts for travel. Gympie Medical Transport is 100 per cent volunteer run and is filling a much-needed role in the region. I congratulate Bev Goodall and her committee on their hard work and their success.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the 500 players associated with the Noosa Dolphins rugby club, their $9,500 grant has been used to purchase essential gear, including tackling pads, junior and senior rugby balls and scrum-practising equipment. This support will help players to train and reach their best, whether they're six or 60.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the motor sports fan, a $15,000 grant for the Maryborough Sporting Car Club will be used for shade structures to cover the junior competitor area at the Maryborough Speedway. Clubs like this provide a community network, and this will provide a sun-safe space for competitors and spectators so more people can enjoy events like races, monster trucks and the World Series Sprintcars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Men's sheds throughout Australia also play a vital role in connecting our regional communities, and their work has never been as important as in the past 18 months as we recover from the isolation inflicted by COVID-19. Funding through the National Shed Development Program is helping the Maryborough and Gympie men's sheds to bring their communities together, with new computers and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        equipment. These two grants, of $2,070 and $1,900 respectively, will make it easier for the men's shed members to reduce social isolation, stay connected with the broader community, create opportunities for new training and keep accurate records.
       </p>
       <p>
        Volunteers and veterans groups and sporting services organisations are at the heart of Wide Bay's community, and I'll keep working hard to ensure local groups can access the funding they need to keep our communities strong.
