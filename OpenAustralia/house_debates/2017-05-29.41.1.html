        I rise today to pay tribute to Shirley Wilhelm,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        and Paul Harris Fellow. Born in 1930, Shirley grew up on a farm at Monarto South before marrying Maurice Wilhelm in 1950 and moving to live on a dairy farm at Mannum with Maurice and his parents. Between milking cows, cooking and serving five meals a day, raising three children and keeping house, Shirley also found time to contribute to her community. The list of these contributions is long and exemplifies the dedication and hard work Shirley had for her community throughout her life.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was a founding member of the Younghusband branch of the Women's Agricultural Bureau, serving as president in 1957. She judged cooking and preserves for eight regional country shows a year and managed the church's guild thrift shop. She was catering secretary for the

        Lutheran Ladies Guild. She was an active member of the Friends of Lerwin Nursing home and volunteer with the

        </a>
        service.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no question that the list is long and impressive. Shirley served as state president of the Women's Agricultural Bureau, during which time she initiated the first health hotline for regional citizens. Shirley was eventually awarded life membership. Life membership was also awarded to Shirley from the Murray Bridge Show Society. Shirley was the first female Rotary member in Murray Bridge, joining the Mobilong Club in 1993, and went on to serve as its first female president in 2001.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her vast volunteer work was recognised in 2012, when Shirley was awarded the Order of Australia medal. Shirley's life was one of serviceâ€”service to her family, her church and her community. Shirley's quiet influence and generosity will never be forgotten. Vale Shirley Wilhelm OAM.
