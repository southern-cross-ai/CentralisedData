       <p>
        I rise to speak on the government's plan for a consultative forum on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        Airport, FOWSA. The proposed make-up of FOWSA, yet again, shows that there is one rule for the eastern half of Sydney and a different rule for the west when it comes to airports. The membership of FOWSA announced by the minister excludes federal members of parliament. By contrast, Sydney Airport Community Forum has 11 federal MPs including the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Urban Infrastructure. SACF has every local federal member affected by aircraft noiseâ€”in other words, every single electorate within cooee of the airport, including those on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore" rel="nofollow">
         North Shore
        </a>
        . But, in its plans for FOWSA, there is not a single spot dedicated for federal MPs. I raised this issue with the Minister for Urban Infrastructure's office late last year and there has been no response. It is completely unacceptable that federal MPs in Western Sydney are excluded in a forum that will have a key role in the process of determining the airspace and flight path design for the airport.
       </p>
       <p>
        You also have to question the survey that came out today that claims people want a 24/7 airport in Western Sydney without decent rail infrastructure. What questions were asked? What information was people given? Who was asked? How many were surveyed? I am not going to take it seriously until we know those things. This continues an attitude of arrogance about the people of Western Sydney.
