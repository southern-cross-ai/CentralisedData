        I rise today to speak to you on behalf of some the many charities who do tireless work in our community, to help those who cannot always help themselves. Tonight I hope to remind fellow members of the importance of giving back to the community, and to highlight the good work already being done.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the member for Paterson, I love supporting the groups that give support to so many others, whether it be physical, emotional, monetary or just raising awareness of the challenges others face. In particular, I am always touched when I meet a constituent who faces daily hardship, but battles to overcome their barriers in order to succeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        One such constituent is seven-year-old Sam Parkinson from Lorn. Sam was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was just three years of age. Despite having to endure daily finger pricks and injections, Sam is an active kid who loves the outdoors, especially his sport, playing local cricket, soccer and basketball. Like any sufferer, Sam has days when he questions why he has to endure the condition. But his mum Rebecca says, he is starting to develop an understanding of why it is so important to look after his health, and help raise money to find a cure.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Sunday, 8 November, along with Sam’s family, ‘Team Baldwin’, including 2HD’s Luke Grant and

        finalist, Sean Doudle, pounded the Newcastle foreshore as part of the

        </a>
        ‘Walk to Cure Diabetes’. I was sincerely humbled by the generosity of my network of supporters who helped me raise more than $9,000 for research into type 1 diabetes. By posting information about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDRF" rel="nofollow">
         JDRF
        </a>
        on my website and Facebook, I was also able to raise awareness of the impacts of this disease, especially for children.
       </p>
       <p>
        While type 1 diabetes affects more than 140,000 people in Australia, it is not always fully understood. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, more common in children than cancer, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy. In simple terms, the immune system turns on itself, destroying cells and removing the body’s ability to produce insulin. Without this, the body literally starves, as it cannot process food. Sufferers often have to endure painful insulin injections, and complications include eye disease, nerve damage, kidney disease and stroke.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is working hard to drive research into a cure. It seeks out and monitors the best scientists in the world, to make significant advances in treatment. But this cannot be done without money, lots of it, and I am very proud to have been able contribute in some small way to this very worthwhile cause. I ask today that other members of this parliament use their resources and standing in the community to make a difference. In particular, I would like to draw attention to an event in March 2010, to be hosted by JDRF.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kids" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in the House event will again bring young type 1 diabetes sufferers from across Australia to this parliament so that we may be able to put a face to the disease. I urge all members to get involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another charity effort I am passionately supporting is Movember, and as you have seen this week in parliament, Mr Speaker, I have put my face on the line in support of it, as have many of my parliamentary colleagues. During Movember, I am raising awareness of men’s health issues, in particular prostate cancer and depression. While many of us blokey types prefer not to visit the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        , this event highlights the importance of simply talking to your mates about your health problems, whether it be on the cricket pitch, around the barbecue or in the backyard shed. It is hoped that, in this way, we can get more men to visit their doctor and improve the health of males in our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        To date, ‘Team Baldwin’ Movember, through our network of supporters, have raised more than $1,400 for support and research regarding prostate cancer and depression in men. I never fail to be surprised when people dig deep into their pockets, despite the tough economic times and rising interest rates. Their generosity is outstanding. With just 13 days to go, I hope to raise much, much more for the Movember Foundation. These fundraising efforts through my support network clearly show that we can make a difference and give back to the community where we live. Whether you give a month, a day or an hour, any effort can help improve the lives of others. To everyone in my support network, I say a special thankyou. As a proud elected representative of Paterson, I feel I have a special responsibility. Constituents constantly remind me how lucky I am and how many opportunities there are to do something good and give back to my community. I urge all members of this parliament to find some time to do the same, to support those in our community who support others.
