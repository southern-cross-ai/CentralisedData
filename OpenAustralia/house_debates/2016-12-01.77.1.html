       <p>
        Before the parliament rises, I want to say a few words about my friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Sciacca" rel="nofollow">
         Con Sciacca
        </a>
        . Con is a much-loved member of our Labor familyâ€”a mentor, a friend, a source of wise and fearless counsel for many in this chamber, in the other place and in Queensland Labor. For 15 years, in two different stints, he served in this place as the member for Bowman, as a shadow minister under

        </a>
        and as a greatly respected Minister for Veterans' Affairs under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Keating
        </a>
        . His work on Australia Remembers, I think, will be remembered for a very long time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Con is one of those people who succeeds in everything they turn their hand to, from politics to business and the law. But success has never changed him. Right now Con is doing it tough. He has got a struggle ahead with his health, but he is a fighter and he is blessed with a loving wife, Karen, a beloved daughter, Zina, and a granddaughter, Grace, whom he simply adores. These strong women are with him, and I want Con and his family to know the whole Labor Party are with him. Too often in our busy modern life we do not take the time to tell people how much they are admired, how much they are loved. Con, we know you are a fighter. We know you are fighting hard. We are with you and your family all the way.
