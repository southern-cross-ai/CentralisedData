       <p>
        I wish to discuss some wonderful, great things that are happening in the manufacturing industry in Tasmania, just to repudiate some of the nonsense that we have heard from the other side of the House this evening. In my home state of Tasmania, manufacturing is and always has been of critical importance. Manufacturing is Tasmania’s largest industry, responsible for approximately 14 per cent of the state’s production.
       </p>
       <p>
        The food and beverage manufacturing sector—of which 65 per cent is in Braddon, in Tasmania’s north-west—is the state’s major manufacturing employer, employing some 22 per cent of employees. This sector is closely followed by wood and paper production manufacturing, metals products manufacturing and machinery and equipment manufacturing. The list goes on and on. Yes, I have left the other side to hear the good news about what is reality out there in the marketplace. Across the state, the manufacturing sector employs over 24,500 people. Total manufacturing turnover is around $5.5 billion, contributing almost $2.5 billion to the gross state product, for which the electorate of Braddon accounts for some 49 per cent of contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        My own electorate of Braddon is home to a substantial number of businesses in over 40 distinct sectors, ranging from the production of agricultural goods to the production of innovative high-tech engineering products, an economic environment that only this side of the House is capable of developing. In Braddon, some 15 per cent of the adult workforce are employed in some form of manufacturing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike the picture painted by the opposition, it was most pleasing to read recently that Australia’s exports have nudged the all-time record, rising in January to the second-highest figure ever of just over $18.12 billion. It was also particularly pleasing that the largest rise was in the exports of manufactured items, which were up by six per cent to almost $3.8 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmanian manufacturers are recognised globally as innovative and productive in the export sector, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the electorate of Braddon. Our manufacturing segment provides strengths and opportunities in the region, with a considerable competitive advantage and a strong investment position.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investment in our region has increased correspondingly. Combining local industry knowledge and innovative thinking with the intellectual capital of our regional educational institutions, which include the campuses of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Technical_College" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Technical College
        </a>
        , Northern Tasmania and the local technical and further education college, is another example of the way local manufacturing companies are maintaining their competitive edge.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have recently spoken in this House about Aus-Tech Composites, a north-west Tasmanian company that has demonstrated excellence in innovation through its work in the wind energy sector and is now extending into caravan construction.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another local company whose success I would like to draw attention to is Doric Engineering. Doric Engineering of Devonport is a Tasmanian engineering company which has been demonstrating innovation and excellence in its field of speciality for over 40 years. It recently began production of 2,000 purpose-built shipping containers for a major transcontinental minerals project.
       </p>
       <p>
        In discussing excellence in innovation, it would be difficult for anyone not to have noticed the success of Delta Hydraulics. Delta Hydraulics is a supplier to the highly specialised defence industry and has been involved with the hydraulic components for inboard hydraulic systems on the Collins class submarine, as used by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Mader International, located at Penguin, is another great success story, with increased domestic and international demand for its products, including ambulances and other specialised vehicles such as counterterrorism vehicles, which will be sold in Australia and overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, I would like to make mention of Caterpillar Elphinstone, which is located in Braddon and is currently in the top two in the world for underground mining equipment. The business has a current turnover of over $145 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sustained and positive growth of the national economy which has resulted from the strong economic policies of the Howard government over the past 11 years has been the foundation of growth in my electorate. The Howard government has also supported growth in the region through funding the establishment of the Australian technical college and has provided continuing support for the Bass Strait Freight Equalisation Scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am immensely proud that the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship is alive and strong in Braddon, in Tasmania’s north-west, and this has all culminated in an investment strategy that has been developed.
