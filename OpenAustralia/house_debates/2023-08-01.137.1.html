       <p>
        July was my seventh anniversary as the member for Barton in this place, and every day representing the people of Barton has been a privilege. Last week I met Elise, a nine-year-old student in my electorate, her mother and her older sister, Tiffiny. Elise has just begun treatment for a rare disease. I was floored by her bravery. Despite the effects of treatment, Elise's school principal says, she does her schoolwork every day. She is getting on in a charming and smart way. I would like to recognise the support of her teachers, principal and all the school staff for Elise and her family. This is an example of a community rallying around a family in need, something I see every day in my electorate: the spirit of caring for community.
       </p>

        The constituents of Barton are also actively involved in volunteering their time and skills to care for the local community. They have the backing of significant government investment: $10 million to plant trees along the riverbanks of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooks_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        thanks to the minister, who is in the chamber today. This work will be delivered by the Cooks River Alliance, in partnership with Indigenous rangers. The alliance is a partnership of

        and local council organisations and residents along the Cooks River catchment. I thank everyone involved in this work, especially the hardworking volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another recent highlight was the Understanding the Voice forum. I was so proud of my community. They came out in their hundreds to spend a Saturday morning at Rockdale Town Hall to learn about the referendum. There was a huge level of engagement among the many culturally diverse groups and organisations. As minister, I travel this country—Tasmania,

        and

        —and I will always take with me the spirit of Barton. It makes me very, very proud to be the member and see the bravery of people like Elise and the courage, curiosity and enthusiasm of people from Barton.
