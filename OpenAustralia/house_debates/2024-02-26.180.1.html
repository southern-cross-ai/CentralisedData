        There are many beautiful parts of my electorate of Casey, and one in particular that I'd like to talk about today is the wonderful Upper Yarra. I had a chance in the last week to spend some time at quite a few community events, including the general meeting for the Community Economic Development Association at the Carriage Cafe in Seville. It was a wonderful chance to hear from the Cog Bike Cafe on how they're using bike tracks to drive economic development in our area and, importantly, to engage the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also wonderful to hear from Kate at

        , which does such important work supporting those who are less fortunate to make sure they have food and social connection. Congratulations to the new

        president, Anna Tehan. I look forward to working with her in the committee as they go from strength to strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        But what is great about CEDA is that they deliberately have community in their name, and it's about helping others. I want to give a shout-out to one of their members, a well-known Wandin local, Norman Orr. I had the pleasure to open the Eastern 80 bike ride, where he raises funds for the

        . This year was the ninth year and they raised $90,000. Next year, their 10th year, we're aiming for $100,000. Congratulations to Norm and the team at Eastern 80.

        , I had the opportunity to see Suyin and the Koha Community Cafe. I served a little bit of food and, while my hospitality skills were poor, I could see the social connection of those that had a chance to catch up and talk to each other in a place where they felt safe and secure.
