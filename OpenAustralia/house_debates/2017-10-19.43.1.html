        I rise to submit a petition on environmental damage in Vietnam related to the fishing industry, the impact this damage is having on local fishers and whether we should be reviewing our aid commitments in light of the circumstances of this impact on the fishing industry. The petition also raises very serious concerns about issues of religious freedom in Vietnam. As a longstanding advocate for religious liberty in all countries around the world, the situation in Vietnam—where there is stigmatisation and marginalisation of some religious communities, particularly those who are Catholic and who sometimes end up being asylum seekers in Australia—remains an enduring issue of concern for me. It is an issue that I have dealt with in the past, in my visits to Hanoi, in my former capacity as a Human Rights Commissioner. I have also dealt with the enduring challenges around freedom of speech, particularly for marginalised bloggers who wish to stand up and speak out about political issues in Vietnam. The petition seeks to address these issues by raising them with our government. I bring it to the government's attention and hope that they will take appropriate action.

        2016, millions of tons of fish were found dead on the Vietnamese central coastline due to toxic waste discharged by Formosa Steel International, leading to one of the biggest environmental disaster in the region in recent times. After several months of denial, Formosa conceded responsibility. This catastrophe decimated the Vietnamese fishing industry, leading to countless job losses, profound health and environmental implication on humans, fauna, flora and surrounding ecosystems. How far, how wide and how long its impact is yet to be determined. The lack of response from the government lead to protests, and calls for action to assist victims, remedial action and accountability across the world.
