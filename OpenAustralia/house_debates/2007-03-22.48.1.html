        My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House how the government’s employment and workplace relations policies are contributing to job creation for young Australians? Are there any threats to that contribution?

         I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I note that when Labor was last in government in 1996 the unemployment rate in Stirling was 9.4 per cent. Today it is 5.4 per cent and I think it is going to go lower.

               Youth unemployment is still too high at 9.7 per cent, but it is certainly lower than the 15.2 per cent when Labor was last in government. However, teenage wages have risen by 6½ per cent in real terms, whereas under 13 years of Labor they fell backwards 5.1 per cent. What we have to do is to try and encourage young people into jobs. So I was quite alarmed when I saw a notice go out at a Kiama public school for a meeting with ‘

History teachers are urged to steer their classes towards subjects such as ‘The role of unions in participatory democracy’. This is what the Labor Party is about.

That is what it would be like. The Labor Party is for union bosses and about protecting union bosses; the coalition is about jobs, jobs for young people that lead to well-paid careers.
