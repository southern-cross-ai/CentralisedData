        I rise to acknowledge the sudden passing of Angus Macneil AM from Rand in southern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . Many members and senators from my side of politics will know Angus as a true Liberal Party stalwart, serving on the New South Wales Liberal Rural and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Regional Committee
        </a>
        and as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEC" rel="nofollow">
         FEC
        </a>
        president in the seat of Farrer for well over 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alongside his strong commitment to family, Angus dedicated much of his active working life to the wider Rand community's social and environmental wellbeing and benefit, using a gentle, spirited passion and enthusiasm. This service to community started young, when, in his early 20s, he attended a local football club meeting where no-one had put their hand up for the vacant role of president. With everyone turning around looking blankly, in the end, Angus said, 'I'll do it.' In his words, 'I didn't have a clue how to run a meeting or anything like it, but that's really where it all started.' Over the next 50 years he would play pivotal and voluntary roles through New South Wales Farmers, Grain Producers Australia, Landcare and the Murray Catchment Management Authority.
       </p>
       <p>
        He became a local councillor with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urana_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Urana Shire
        </a>
        and chaired or organised numerous committees and groups to benefit Rand and citizens through the southern Riverina. He did all this while running his own family farm in a very progressive, forward-looking wayâ€”and he was always, like many farmers, keen to share his knowledge and his experience. When the railway lines were removed from the town of Rand and trees were planted, he went out during hot summers and watered them to make sure they survived. I doubt anyone else would have. When everyone was painting their silos, he was determined that the Rand silo should be part of this and that people could find this unusual and rather special town in the Riverina. Those are just two simple examples of his community spirit.
       </p>
       <p>
        On his first meeting with you, he would lope towards you with a long, outstretched hand and a cheerful grin, a bit like a character popping out of a Ken Maynard Ettamogah Pub cartoon. He was the one constant in my political life. He had called me on the phone out of nowhere, suggesting that I become the candidate for Farrer, in a contest where the Liberal Party was never expected to win. In politics his profound belief was that the Liberal Party is best placed to help people wanting to give life their best shot, whether they live in the city, the country or beyond. His motto in life was a simple one: 'You can achieve a great deal if you don't care who claims the credit.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Angus was honoured with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        in 2019. He passed away suddenly, aged 80, on Sunday night, leaving behind his beloved wife, Gail, daughters, Georgie and Kate, and their families. On behalf of myself, our local community and the Liberal Party, I extend our heartfelt sympathy and best wishes and warm thanks for all he was able to achieve. Angus Alan John Macneil, rest in peace.
