         The government takes the issue of listing medicines and the funding and paying for that element of health care extremely seriously. Frankly, I think that question was just despicable.

           I thank the member for his question. As the House might recall, in 2007 the then Minister for Defence,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Nelson" rel="nofollow">
            Brendan Nelson
           </a>
           , now our ambassador in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
            NATO
           </a>
           , announced the acquisition of three air warfare destroyers for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Australian Navy
           </a>
           . This government, in the Defence white paper 2009, confirmed that we would proceed with the acquisition of these three new ships, and they ships are currently due for delivery in December 2014. When complete, the air warfare destroyer will be one of the more capable types of warship of its size in the world. They provide advance air defence against missiles and aircraft for self-protection, as well as for other ships and for land forces in coastal areas.
          </p>
          <p>
           The total cost of the project is about $8 billion, with a significant benefit for local Australian industry. Overall, the estimate is that around 50 per cent of the total value of the project will be spent in Australia. The ships are being constructed in 90 separate blocks, which are being fabricated in three separate Australian shipyards: in Adelaide at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
            ASC
           </a>
           shipyard, in Melbourne at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE" rel="nofollow">
            BAE
           </a>
           Systems shipyard and in Newcastle at the Forgacs shipyard. They will ultimately be assembled in Adelaide.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today, the Minister for Defence Materiel and I announced a reallocation of work for that project. This is necessary because, in addition to the air warfare destroyer work, the Melbourne BAE Systems shipyard is also building blocks for the superstructure for the two new landing helicopter dock ships due for delivery in 2014-15. The Melbourne shipyard is stretched, working on two major projects at the same time. The government, the Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance and BAE Systems takes the schedule for these two very important projects most seriously. In February of this year, BAE Systems advised the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWD" rel="nofollow">
            AWD
           </a>
           Alliance of potential schedule delays. As a consequence of that, I met with BAE Systems United Kingdom in London in March of this year. The Minister for Defence Materiel speaks regularly to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            BAE Systems Australia
           </a>
           , Jim McDowell, and on this particular matter has met and spoken with him on a number of occasions in recent months.
          </p>
          <p>
           Over the last few months the AWD Alliance and BAE Systems have been working very closely to prepare options to improve the production outcomes, and earlier this month BAE Systems presented the alliance with a plan to adjust this workload on the air warfare destroyer project. The advice of the alliance was that if no action were taken to relieve the pressure on the Melbourne shipyard the first ship would be two years late. As a consequence of these discussions and that possible outcome, the Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance, with the support of BAE Systems and with the support of the Minister for Defence Materiel and I, propose to take the following action.
          </p>
          <p>
           Firstly, up to 13 steel blocks will be reallocated among the three Australian shipyards in Adelaide, Melbourne and Newcastle and up to five blocks will be reallocated to Navantia in Ferrol, Spain. This action will reduce the schedule risk for both this project and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHD" rel="nofollow">
            LHD
           </a>
           , landing helicopter dock, ships project. The Air Warfare Destroyer Alliance has advised that this action will reduce the estimated delay of the completion of the first ship by up to 12 months and all three AWDs by the same period. It will also reduce the pressure on BAE Systems to complete its work on the LHD ships.
          </p>
          <p>
           Importantly, I am advised that there will be little, if any, adverse impact on the current Melbourne BAE Systems shipyard workforce, which is around 300, as a result of this decision. That workforce will continue to have the opportunity to work on the AWDs as well as the landing helicopter docks, and that is a good thing for Melbourne as it is a good thing for Adelaide and Newcastle.

             Pacific Highway
            </a>
            will cost an additional $7 billion above everything that is provided in the forward estimates. How will the Treasurer meet the Prime Minister's promise to complete this project by 2016 and still return the budget to surplus by 2012-13?

             Through a prudent fiscal policy and strict fiscal discipline, and working with state governments who will have to bear their share of the burden. We will do that in both those ways. I will tell you what: we have shown a lot more interest in the

              Pacific Highway

            <p>
             We have a commitment and a priority for the Pacific Highway that those opposite never had. The other thing that they will not do is tell anybody how they are going to fund any of their commitments. How would they fund the Pacific Highway?

              I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. As the member for Mackellar pointed out yesterday, there is provision in the standing orders for a minister, if he does not know the answer to a question, to simply say so and return to the House later and answer the question. He is clearly not answering the question and I would ask you to draw him back to the question or sit him down.

                a lot in my life, one of the things that I am proudest of in this budget is the commitment of $1 billion to the Pacific Highway. I am really proud of that. I am proud of the performance of our roads minister here, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, who has made a very big commitment to the Pacific Highway and, of course, the Independent members, who have a real interest in this highway. I know how dangerous this highway is because I am a Queenslander and I have driven it all my life. We have a commitment there that has not been there from those opposite. Our total commitment is $4.1 billion, compared to the Howard government's $1.3 billion. That is the answer to your question.

                    North Sydney

                   has a problem when I correct the mistake that I made, he can raise a point of order. It was not a mistake. The incident that he remembers from earlier in the week was about the rotation of the call. I gave the call on the rotation. The fact that maybe the Leader of the Opposition was a little slow is not something that I highlighted at the time. But I will not, when I can recover from a mistake and I have admitted a mistake, have it challenged in the way that the member for North Sydney did.

                     I thank the member for Hunter, the Chief Government Whip, for his question. Indeed, as of today, at 1.30, we have passed 112 pieces of legislation through this House—112 supported, zero opposed by this House of Representatives. And we have done that in just eight months. How does that compare with our predecessors? Those opposite would like to say that this parliament cannot function properly because it requires proper negotiation. The fact is that in the first 12 months of the Howard government 108 bills were passed by the House of Representatives, so we have been more efficient and more productive on this side of the House in terms of getting legislation through. Big changes have gone through the House, on the economy, on child care, on family services. This parliament is working efficiently and effectively. Through cooperation and discipline, this government is implementing its agenda to secure the future prosperity of this country.

They are all having a go there, and I know that this was of great interest particularly to the member for Wentworth, who saw it as part of the attack by the Leader of the Opposition. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has done for political discourse what the vuvuzela did for World Cup soccer—lots of noise, interesting at the beginning but annoying when that is the only noise it can make. The only noise it can make is one of opposition.

                             I thank the member for that question. The government absolutely understands the concern felt by electricity consumers about price rises that are occurring under the regulatory framework that has been in place not just under this government but under the past government. The member for Boothby is trying to draw a link between these price rises and the impact of a carbon price we do not yet have. That demonstrates what a baseless scare campaign they are engaged in. The fact is that there are pressures in the system and prices are going up and that is putting pressures on families. The opposition seek to say that is somehow a consequence of decisions that have been taken by this government. They know that to be completely false.

                                  Everybody in this House knows that prices are going up and it has been caused by inadequate investment in the system over a long period of time. Those opposite might seek to deny it now, but they were open about it prior to the last election. For them to go out there now and run a baseless scare campaign somehow linking it to a future carbon price demonstrates just how dishonest they are. They know that the country has to face up to this tough decision. The government will face up to this decision. We will take a responsible decision in the interests of all consumers.

                                    I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know that in the electorate she represents, which has some 2,068 very long term unemployed people, they will certainly welcome the additional assistance we have announced. We on this side are very proud of the 700,000 jobs that have been created since we have been in government. But we also see that, as we head towards an unemployment rate of some 4.5 per cent with an additional 500,000 jobs to be created in the coming years, this provides us with a unique opportunity. As a nation, we are faced with a unique chance to transform the lives of the very long term unemployed and to break the cycle of welfare dependency. As a government, we are absolutely determined that we are not going to leave anyone behind in this period of growth.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    In this year's budget the government is investing an additional $227.9 million in new measures to specifically target the very long term unemployed. In Australia, currently 230,000 people are classified as very long term unemployed. We know that once a job seeker has been unemployed for one year they have a 54 per cent chance of being unemployed for at least another year; so we need to step in and break this cycle. Of the new funding, $94.6 million will be used to create 35,000 wage subsidies to be paid to employers who take on and retain people who have been unemployed for more than two years. This will create powerful new opportunities across the nation. These subsidies, totalling around $6,000 each, will be paid for at least six months and will be available to both private businesses and social enterprises, creating the opportunity to transform the lives of very long term unemployed Australians and those of their family members and their communities.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    We also know that people who have been unemployed for a very long period can have difficulty accessing full-time work, because they often do not have the work experience and skills that employers are looking for. We know that a lack of activity is detrimental to people's health and wellbeing and undermines their job readiness, so the government is putting in place stronger requirements and more resources in order to keep the very long term unemployed active and job ready. Under previous arrangements of both this government and the previous government, job seekers only had to meet activity requirements for six months each year. Those who are now very long term unemployed will in future, under this government, be required to be active in their engagement for 11 months each year. Those job seekers will be required to undertake activities like job training, volunteering, job trials and Work for the Dole if they are to continue to be eligible for income support. We are allocating some $133 million through this budget to fund these activities.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    We know the Australian economy needs workers if we are going to take advantage of the minerals boom and manage the challenges of an ageing population. This presents a very great opportunity for Australians who have been out of work for a large amount of time, who face significant barriers to re-engagement in the labour market. Our government is determined to provide those Australians with the incentives and the support they need in order to get back into the labour market. We are proud to have presented a budget directed towards this.

                                     My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that an average school in Victoria is spending up to $58,000 a year on power and other utilities. Will the government compensate schools like these for the increase in electricity prices as a result of the carbon tax or does the government expect these increased costs to be met through higher charges to parents?

                                      I thank the member for his question because putting in place a price on carbon is a very significant and fundamental reform for the future of our country. In the past when this country has faced up to the challenges before it and put in place very significant reforms, like we did in the late eighties and early nineties, there were always very big scare campaigns being run during those times, particularly by those opposite. And they are at it again. The fact is that our economy would not have come through the global recession in the shape that it did if it had not been for the actions that were put in place during that period, particularly reforms like national superannuation, which was so important to get us through the global recession. The point I want to make is that you have to face up to the hard reforms if you want to be honest with people. If you want to talk to people about the future, you cannot put the hard reforms in the too-hard basket.

                                         I was explaining why we need to put a price on carbon. It is because it is absolutely essential to the job security of Australians and our future prosperity. That is why the government is engaging in a thorough consultation with the wider community, the multiparty committee and the business community. We are working closely to design an emissions trading scheme.

The fact is that this country has to price carbon. We on this side of the House believe in doing something about dangerous climate change—

It is more than three years since the historic apology to the stolen generation, one of the most important moments in the history of this parliament—in fact, in our history. The acknowledgement of past injustices and the commitment to the healing journey means that we now must redouble our efforts to close the gap. Not only today with National Sorry Day but with the beginning of reconciliation week, I think we as a nation have an opportunity to recognise the past, to understand that there was injustice and suffering, and to know that we are on the path to healing.

It means independence, opportunity and hope. The fact is that education breaks the poverty cycle, a cycle that is experienced by Aboriginal and

We know the gap between the educational outcomes of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people is unacceptably large, but we also know that there are some really good things happening out there in Australian schools that are changing lives. Yes, the national statistics tell us a sobering story, but the efforts of many of our schools, using the $2.5 billion national partnerships money that this government has brought forward, is encouraging.

                                               Let me just identify a few of those encouraging stories. In Western Australia, 94 per cent of participating national partnerships schools are reporting improved engagement and participation of Aboriginal parents and communities. In the Hume region in Victoria, literacy intervention programs are seeing Indigenous student participation in year 3

                                               we have Aboriginal community engagement strategies implemented in over 270 schools. Ninety-three have now got Aboriginal elders or community members working with teachers. That makes a big difference in a school. Two hundred and forty-four teachers from all the education sectors are undertaking Aboriginal education and cultural programs. Over 1,200 government school teachers are participating in training courses to support Aboriginal students. This makes a huge difference. The investment makes a huge difference. Sometimes there is one committed person who can make a difference.

I find it very strange that some people suggest it is the case only with certain individuals. The member for Aston will resume his seat. I think that this is a very rare attempt to follow up on something where there has already been a personal explanation. I might excuse the member for Aston, as he is a newer member and given that he has perhaps seen what members of longer standing do. If members do not have respect for the present occupant of the chair they might at least have some respect for the institution of Speaker. I simply indicate to the member for Aston that if something else has happened then it is only that that can be referred to, not what happened in question time yesterday. I remind the member for Aston that personal explanations are on indulgence, which is given by the Speaker and can be withdrawn by the Speaker. The member for Aston must explain to me where he has a further grievance. The member for Aston.

On 1 February 2010 the Grants Commission had an extensive discussion and reaffirmation about high and low royalties and differences between lump sum iron ore, which is high, and of course iron ore fines, which were regarded as low. On 10 March the Western Australian Treasurer,

It is not qualified, it is not talking about the Pilbara, it is not being in any way specific about a particular class of iron ore fines; it is the general concession applying to iron ore fines. The Treasurer knew this, because on the very same day that he received this advice from the Treasury he addressed the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce, where he said, 'We are prepared to talk further with state governments who might have been making their own plans to capture a fairer share of resource wealth through lifting royalties.' A fairer share. So the Treasurer now is so critical of Western Australia for removing the concessions on iron ore fines that he not only said that the states understandably have to do it but he wants to talk to them about it. On the same day at a doorstop, he was asked by a journalist:

It means that there was always an assumption by this government that the state governments would remove concessions and it was prepared to rebate up to 7.5 per cent. Quite plainly the government is encouraging confusion in relation to this matter. On 20 October, and the Prime Minister herself has quoted this in this parliament, Premier Barnett says on ABC radio that they have no plan to increase royalties. That is where the Prime Minister stopped, but he actually went on to say, 'we did get rid of some concessions, and perhaps some other concessions that in time might be phased out.' That is what he said—so he is going to phase it out. On 21 October Premier Barnett is quoted in the

On 16 November, the Western Australian Under Secretary, failing to have received a response to his first letter, writes again to the Secretary to the Treasury asking what is going to happen to the Western Australian state budget due to the treatment of royalties. In February 2011, the Treasurer writes to the chairperson of the Grants Commission—he referred to this today in question time—saying that, in regard to the removal of iron ore fines royalty rate concessions in 2010, 'the classification of iron ore fines should not move between mineral royalty rates groups in between methodology reviews'.
                                                                         </p>

It was the very same principle, the very same issue and was based on the very same assumption, that a royalty rate regime would be at 7.5 per cent. Premier Barnett, just a few days later, said on Perth radio that if they wanted to refund to the mining companies increases in state royalties, then they had to pay for that out of their own revenue; that was their choice. On 18 May, last week, the chief of staff of the Western Australian Premier rings up the chief of staff to the Treasurer and he says, 'We are going to lift the royalties in the budget tomorrow; we are going to remove the concession on iron ore fines tomorrow, in the budget.' Two days later, the Treasurer goes into the media and claims it came as an enormous shock—he says:
                                                                         </p>

He claims that what he said was absolutely right—it all came as a surprise, even though there is a huge amount of information that proves that it was not a surprise. He said it came out of the blue.
                                                                         </p>

This is a pattern of behaviour from his earliest days as Treasurer, in 2008, when he said that the inflation genie was out of the bottle. He went on to introduce a budget in 2008 that was in fact inflationary. It put up the price of alcopops, it put up the price of cars and it would effectively put up the price of private health insurance. That is what he did—he introduced an inflationary budget at exactly the time that he and the then Prime Minister were declaring war on inflation.

The Treasurer, so lacking in belief in his own integrity, so lacking in belief in his own competence, hides behind the Secretary to the Treasury, always releasing documents and private advisory notes from the Secretary to the Treasury to himself. He is so lacking in confidence that he is hiding all the way behind Ken Henry. It took us weeks to find out that in fact in that crisis room there was no Governor of the

There was an unlimited guarantee on deposits, and then it was limited to $1 million, and reclassified again, not only creating confusion but also muddling the protections that were necessary for the financial system.

Tens of thousands of those cheques were going not only overseas to stimulate offshore economies but also to dead people—as if there was anything that could stimulate them! Of course there is one program that I do not forget that was part of a rescue package that the Treasurer is so proud of—I can see the

                                                                         </p>

What an unsightly brawl between the Treasurer and the Prime Minister back in 2008. It took them 21 days to work out after MYEFO that they might have to go into deficit. Then in 2009 the Treasurer could not bring himself to say what the deficit was in the budget speech. He broke new ground. Not only did he break new ground by refusing to name the deficit; he broke new ground because it was so big. Of course, we all remember the government coming in here time and time again saying they were temporary deficits. They look pretty damn permanent to me. When it comes to debt, we all remember how the Treasurer was encouraging the then Prime Minister not to mention the number—$200 billion. Do you remember that? It was too big a number for them to get their minds around. Even on this budget night, when the budget net debt went from $94 billion to $107 billion, the Treasurer said it was tiny. That is the word he used: 'tiny'—'very tiny' he said on 2UE.
                                                                         </p>

How often does a politician have to say he is not going to increase royalties before those opposite will believe him?

Mr Barnett said that while the different rates didn't make sense to him, the government had no plans to increase the fines rate in the foreseeable future.

That day, on 6PR—a radio station, if you were not aware of that—he made it very clear: 'We don't have any plans to increase royalties in Western Australia.'

We had always reserved the right to do that, but I understand that they do have to turn up because some of their colleagues missed divisions last night. On 6PR radio Premier Barnett said on those magic airwaves of the radio: 'All I'll say is simply that we are not contemplating one at present.' That was less than eight weeks before the budget. Even if the opposition are still content to besmirch the reputation of a great Treasurer by trying to pretend that Premier Barnett did not say these things, we have to then actually look at what his accomplishments are.

When we look at this matter of public importance, I would have thought the shadow Treasurer, in order to have a debate about the merits of the government, would realise this is not a one-horse race. We have a beast called the opposition. I am using a horse analogy as opposed to any other point about that.

I will cover our handling of the global financial crisis—we would like to conveniently forget the war, would we not? We will look at our handling of the natural disasters and we will look at our fiscal position. In fact, why do we not put in a plan for Australia as a criterion and why do we not talk about jobs? The jobs number is the one that dares not speak its name among the opposition. These are the criteria on which, I think, you can judge our Treasurer versus their imposter.

If you imagine the Australian economy as being $100,000, under us you are paying $21,800 in tax. But what was it under the scallywags of the opposition when they were in government? It was 25 per cent. So there was old Mr Howard and Mr Costello putting their hands in your pocket for $25,000 in every $100,000 in the Australian economy. We are better at keeping down the tax-to-GDP ratio.

The opposition will not even deal with issues of climate change. It is one thing to knock our plan—Her Majesty's loyal opposition have the right to disagree with the government—but it seems to me that there is an obligation, if you are going to knock the plan, to say what you are going to do about it. We know that they do have a plan to spend $10 billion picking winners amongst the biggest polluting companies, but that is not a real plan.

It is interesting to note that, when the Howard government was in power, we had a regime that delivered consistent surpluses year after year. We had a government that had the confidence of the Australian people. We had a government that people believed could deliver efficiently and effectively. But sadly, with the arrival of the Rudd and Gillard governments, there has been a loss of faith by the Australian people in the ability of their federal government both to deliver and to deal with imminent threats to the Australian economy. It is interesting to note that the shadow Treasurer highlighted the fact that it is this government and this Treasurer who present the greatest threat to the Australian economy. They have a complete inability to deal with Australia's economic challenges. On this Treasurer's watch we have seen an economy go from surplus to deficit, the levels of government debt reach record levels and this country plunge into deficit. In typical Labor fashion, this government has increased taxes, spent at record levels, wasted billions of dollars and plunged the country into a record $55 billion deficit. Labor is governing as they always do. They have not delivered a surplus since 1989, and this is simply business as usual for a Labor government.
                                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                                     We hear the Treasurer speak of future surpluses that are just over the horizon—' coming soon to a country near you'—but the reality is that he has not delivered a surplus, and I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he will not deliver a surplus, because this government does not have the courage to ease spending, to pay back its debts and to bring the budget back into surplus. It is into tax grabs and debt financing rather than responsible economic management. If this government was fully focused on delivering a surplus, we would not need to increase the gross debt limit to $250 billion. This Treasurer is simply incapable of delivering a surplus that he speaks about in the future. By 2014, the government will be spending $20 million a day on interest payments alone, just to service its debt. This is money that could be going into roads, into schools, into better health services and into services for regional Australia.

Virtually every element of this project has been delayed. The Tasmanian rollout has been delayed 10 months, the completion of the first mainland sites has been delayed, NBN Co. have indefinitely suspended the tender process for contractors for infrastructure and now we have found that the second release-site stage has also been delayed. The $11 billion deal with Telstra has also been delayed—it is some six months behind schedule.

NBN Co.'s business case makes it clear that the rollout will have that impact on the project viability and the return.

But 15 months into the rollout, how many homes do we have connected? Instead of the 35,000 homes, do we have 10,000 homes connected? No, we do not have 10,000. Do we have 5,000 homes connected? No, we do not have 5,000. In fact, we have 607 homes connected to the NBN.

He is very right—there are seven in Armidale. I will get to Armidale in a minute. So, rather than having reached the target of 35,000 homes in just over 12 months time, we are well on the way: we have 607. Yet 'Trust me,' says Senator Conroy!

What have they achieved in Tasmania? Of the 4,000 eligible households, they achieved a 15 per cent take-up. That was when people could receive the project for free. So they came along and spent $50 billion on a project, they gave it away and only got a take-up of 15 per cent amongst eligible households. It is unlike the iPhone when people queued in the snow to get one—they gave it away for free and people still did not take it up. They are 15 months into the rollout and they have 607 customers and 784 staff. I think the minister should make it his No. 1 priority to make the number of staff fewer than the number of customers. It would be a good objective to have a number of customers greater than the number of staff.

I was really pleased that those seven people signed up; it would have been embarrassing if no-one had signed up. One of those customers was Mr Stroud, who signed up because he wanted access games.

I am pleased that he is pleased, but when you consider that it is a $50 billion project and when you consider the opportunity cost of capital I think it is a real issue for this country that a major part of the demand for broadband services is for recreational services. It seems incredible that we are investing so heavily at a time when the demand drivers that are going to deliver the return on investment for this project cannot be demonstrated. We are paying billions of dollars that could have been spent on other vital infrastructure projects so that Mr Stroud can, to his delight, play

They have no idea how to deliver this project on time and on budget. A cost of this magnitude is putting the Australian government budget under significant threat. With the revenue projections likely to fall well under what was expected for this project, the already slim return of seven per cent is absolutely at risk. This is a potential financial disaster that will have to be financed by the taxpayers of this country. It is an imminent threat to getting this government budget back into surplus. It is an imminent threat to the rollout of other infrastructure projects in the future. There will be a diversion of capital from projects that would deliver higher rates of return to one that quite clearly is not going to deliver the rates of return that have been promised.

This Treasurer has no notion about putting down a budget that will set this country up for the future. We have a Treasurer who is unfit for the position he holds.

The Assistant Treasurer went through in great detail the repeated commitments that had been given by Premier Barnett. On eight occasions within eight months, and most recently within eight weeks of the printing of the budget, he ruled out an increase in the rate of royalties. Regarding this discussion about whether or not the Commonwealth Treasurer knew about the plans of Premier Barnett, let us have a look at the public record. I reaffirm the points that the Assistant Treasurer made by simply pointing out that every single one of those public commitments that the

                                                                                                        Let us have a look at some of the genuinely imminent threats to the Australian economy, and let us have a look at the way in which this Treasurer and this government are responding and dealing with those threats. We could talk about those threats that occurred during the global financial crisis or we could talk about the threats that occurred as a result of the natural disasters that we faced. You would have thought that these were the sorts of imminent threats by which the performance of this Treasurer and this government would be judged. They were the imminent threats that real Australians faced. They were the things that impacted on the lives of everyday Australians across this country.
                                                                                                       </p>
                                                                                                       <p>
                                                                                                        When it came to the global financial crisis we must proudly stand behind the record of what this government delivered. It was a government and a treasurer that acted swiftly and with the degree of decisiveness that was required to ensure that this economy avoided recession, unlike any other advanced economy in the world. Not only did we avoid recession, but we have delivered over 700,000 new jobs since we came to power, at a time when millions of jobs had been shed right across other advanced economies in this world. Indeed, we managed to create jobs and not see a loss of jobs.
                                                                                                       </p>
                                                                                                       <p>
                                                                                                        In terms of the fiscal record of this government, we also see a clear pathway to return the budget to surplus. I would have thought that that was a threat that faces the economy—the threat of rising interest rates in the event that we do not contain government spending and we do not get the budgetary position of the Commonwealth back into order.
                                                                                                       </p>

It is about tackling some of those important challenges, such as skills and labour shortages, this country is facing. And this is not a new challenge, albeit the interruption of the global financial crisis meant that some of those threats abated for a short time. But the

If we look at those imminent threats we can see that when the coalition were in government they failed abysmally to address those imminent threats. But they are at the very heart of the budget that the Treasurer handed down this year. It is about delivering opportunities to ensure that we are able to get more people into work. We already have a participation rate at record levels in this country, but we want to get more people into work. We want to use this once-in-a-generation opportunity of mining boom mark 2. We want to get the benefits out of it, some of which were squandered under mining boom mark 1. We want to get those benefits for the people who have been stuck in unemployment. We want to ensure that we provide them with the assistance and the incentives to get them into the workforce to play a part in the national challenge of meeting the many challenges that flow from the mining boom.

I heard the member for North Sydney talk about the allegations of waste. When it comes to the member for North Sydney, he at least did come into this place and vote against that package. I note that the member for Cowper was offered up as a speaker today. I thought that was interesting. I feel a great degree of sympathy for him. I know that there has been a lot of talk about the leak that the matter of five individuals missing the vote was all about undermining

Indeed, if the truth be known, it was a very evil plan to undermine the position of the member for Cowper. What is the member for Cowper's position again? I am not sure that we know what his position is. The member for Cowper was here on occasions when the global financial crisis was about to strike and the stimulus package was being voted on.

I have often suggested that those on the other side slept through the global financial crisis, because they want to deny its existence. But when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition he may well have slept through it, because he certainly slept through the vote on the stimulus package. It is hardly the record of someone who is fit to govern.

I note that the member for Flinders is with us this afternoon in the chamber. The member for Flinders has really let the cat out of the bag when it comes to the opposition's approach to tackling climate change.

Maybe they see it as being a medium-term or a longer-term threat. In this debate there has been a failure to address some of those longer-term challenges. But the member for Flinders let the cat out of the bag when he was interviewed on

He was asked whether or not the so-called direct action plan—this is subsidies for polluters—would provide long-term certainty for the investment community. The best he could come up with was to confirm that the policy does not even look beyond the next 10 years. It is a policy that is directed towards a target of 2020. But if you are out there in the investment community and you want to make some of those hard investment decisions about whether to invest in the new technologies of the future—whether to make those 30- to 50-year investments across the lifecycle of an asset—if you want some certainly don't go to the coalition because, by his very admission, the member for Flinders has indicated that his policy does not even look beyond the next 10 years.

He can never do it to someone's face. He comes in here and backs up his Treasurer, but he runs around every single boardroom in this country and tells them that he wants his job. He wants his job and then he wants the Prime Minister's job. The Assistant Treasurer has all ambition and no ability. He gave an appalling MPI speech in support of his Treasurer, and we all know why. We hear this from all the corporates in this country who say to us that the Assistant Treasurer rolls up to their boardrooms and says, 'Swanny's not up to it; I'm going to be there shortly.'

We saw that this week in question time. He is a man who has in the past suffered terrible accusations being made about him on issues in which he has been involved, including I note the shadow minister for innovation, industry and science earlier in the week referring to a bagman. That refers to allegations that there was money passed in an election campaign.

We know that the Treasurer has made mistake after mistake, such as spending too much money. The budget this year quite clearly shows that this is a government that has lost control of our finances—deficit budget after deficit budget, debt building up to over $100 billion for the first time in our history, another $50 billion deficit and the claim that we will only return to surplus in 2012-13. If you look at the budget papers, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will see that is purely because this government is taxing more. This government is not making the hard and necessary decisions to cut spending. It is taxing more and the revenue is up.

The first was stating that the banks need not pass on cuts in official interest rates. The Treasurer told a press conference on 8 January 2008:
                                                                                                                       </p>

Thirdly, he told the ABC in 2008 that people affected by government policy should be sent to Centrelink. He said 'these people should investigate whatever opportunities they have through Centrelink'. Fourthly, when asked about the forecast rate of inflation on the release of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, he undertook to cite a figure, saying, 'Who has got my chart?' That comes off the back of a very direct question we asked him in question time this week about whether he could refer to a figure in the budget and we were told by the Treasurer that it was not his job to play word games. He said that the member could go and find it in the budget papers.
                                                                                                                       </p>

You constantly try to get that focused on in question time. Very clearly, the job of the Treasurer is to answer specific questions about his budget. This Treasurer is incompetent and not up to it. But he is a whole lot better than the Assistant Treasurer.

I am not pro-Israel or pro-Palestine but pro-reconciliation, pro-peace and pro-justice. It is the policy of Australia's major political parties and it is Australian government policy to support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. This necessarily means independent states of Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security.

There must be a commitment to non-violence on the part of both sides and all forms of violence against civilians are to be condemned in the strongest terms. However, too often the conflict is spoken of as if it is only the Palestinians who need to change their behaviour. The frequent rocket fire from Gaza into Israel by militant groups is a clear violation of international law. But so too is the disproportionate use of force by Israel against civilians that was evident in the war on Gaza. Also contrary to international law is the blockade on Gaza, which constitutes collective punishment of the civilian population, which has crippled the economy and left thousands of young people without any prospect of work or of leading lives of dignity and which has left 80 per cent of the Gaza population dependent on aid. So too is the program of establishing Israeli cities, roads and the wall in the occupied territory.

It is this context of occupation that is often missing in discussions about the conflict, which usually centre around the issue of security alone.

Last week US President Barack Obama called for a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders. He noted:

Yet the illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are an ongoing poke in the eye to the peace process and to a two-state solution because these so-called 'facts on the ground' form physical obstacles that may foreclose the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.

Australia, as a respected middle power country, is in a position to play a constructive role to help ensure a balanced outcome for both sides and 'to act as a living bridge between despair and hope'.

He told Heidi Clarke-Lewis's family that her life had not been a waste and that her death added weight to the demand for more regional health funding. I agree 100 per cent with Mr Dillon's remarks and so too does Heidi's grieving family. As Heidi's sister Mrs Kathy Langley read in her statement to the inquest:
                                                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                                                         <p class="italic">
                                                                                                                          We may have one of the best health systems in the world, but we are still nowhere near good enough while lives are being lost so carelessly throughout the hospital system. Surely the expectation to receive decent professional medical treatment in this country is a right and not a privilege.
                                                                                                                         </p>

Medical treatment in Australia is a right, not a privilege. Why then is there such a line drawn between city dwellers and regional Australians? You should not have to live in metropolitan areas to receive top level health care and have top level health facilities. However, a line has been drawn—a line which sees that for every Medicare dollar spent on a city dweller, only 51c is spent on their regional compatriots. This is unacceptable. Every Australian deserves to have the same amount spent.
                                                                                                                         </p>

In the country you do not have a choice. You have to use the facilities available. As Mrs Langley quite rightly told the inquest, a new hospital would encourage more qualified staff. Again today I acknowledge the former and present New South Wales governments and the federal government for the contributions they have made towards a new, long overdue Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. But more funding is needed to ensure the complete rebuild of the current dilapidated hospital. This is a project the people of the Riverina have waited for, and waited and waited. They are tired of waiting and they are tired of inadequate facilities.
                                                                                                                         </p>

Heidi was a real person, not a statistic, not merely a number on a medical list kept by health bureaucrats. She was a warm, caring, healthy, happy person who always thought of others first, who had everything to live for. Her death at age 29 was tragically unfortunate and totally unnecessary. I trust that by highlighting the issues the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital faces, and the concerns of Mrs Clarke-Lewis's family and indeed those of the Deputy State Coroner, Wagga Wagga will receive facilities at least equal to those of most other communities in Australia. The constituents of Riverina deserve nothing less. We must ensure we learn from the loss of the young, beautiful and loving Heidi so that her death was not in vain.

This is a summit that I run each year and which brings together students, principals and teachers from schools across the electorate of Petrie. The Schools Summit is a full-day workshop on eight important topics that the schools have contributed to. We work through the topics and at the end of the day the ideas are put together in a submission that will be presented to the Prime Minister, the federal Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, the state Premier and our local mayor so that all three levels of government are aware that our local young people and educators have a voice. This year's topics were: bullying, the proposed year 7 transition to high school, the value of arts and education, community spaces for young people, healthy Australia in the future, media and social wellbeing, role models and iPads in schools.

Not only did Deception Bay State High School host the event this year; its hospitality students catered the event and were assessed on their preparation and service of the food, which was absolutely exquisite. They did an amazing job.

These people turned out to oversee and chair these working groups all day long.

That is what this summit is all about.

I look forward to coming back into this chamber to report on the ideas that have come out of this year's Schools Summit. This is a great opportunity for our young people—from private schools and public schools, primary schools and secondary schools—to come together, sit around a table and share ideas and then go away having built new friendships and relationships. The students quite often keep in contact with each other after the event to keep sharing ideas. This is how you bring communities together. Once again, I congratulate Deception Bay State High School for being the host and showcasing their school at the Petrie Schools Summit for 2011.

This is absolutely shocking in the face of the valuable and internationally recognised work on nuclear disarmament that our government has progressed in recent years. Whilst the government continues to state its vision for a future free of nuclear weapons, the Future Fund is enabling, aiding and abetting those who make weapons of mass destruction—weapons that kill millions of people. This investment must cease immediately.

It was also revealed that the fund had been of the position that the treaties Australia had signed on to did not preclude the fund's investment in nuclear weapons manufacturing companies.

                                                                                                                           </p>

First and foremost, the fund should not be in the business of financing nuclear weapons as a matter of moral imperative and should cease all such investments immediately. That a decision was taken in the first place to assist the Indian nuclear program—India not being a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty—is, in my eyes, a serious error of judgment on both legal and moral grounds. Larsen &amp; Toubro, a company that the fund invests in, tests India's nuclear missiles and builds India's nuclear armed submarines. Under no circumstances should Australian tax revenue be used for such a scandalous purpose.
                                                                                                                           </p>

With some urgency, but also goodwill, this matter can be rectified quickly and the fund can continue its important role in Australia's economy without these damaging investments.

Again, I commend the representatives of the fund for resolving to explore a similar path.

Their use has enormous and catastrophic humanitarian consequences. They cause unimaginable suffering across communities and generations. The Future Fund has recently done the right thing on ceasing investment in cluster bombs, and it now has the opportunity to do the same on nuclear weapons. I welcome its commitment today to consider its position, and I hope that sanity prevails such that Australia's tax revenue is no longer used to finance the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

Schools that have been promised funding are now hearing that the money has been cut. That is right—cut. Members may well ask, 'Who has cut the money?'

Yet they are now told that $225,000 has simply been taken away and the refurbishment of existing buildings that was going to be undertaken has been scrapped. Just outside of my electorate, Warranwood Primary School believed they were allocated $2.7 million to construct a new building and refurbish parts of the school but then, once the main building was nearing completion, they found that the amount they were promised has been dropped and they are at least $200,000 worse off.

As I understand it, there has been no genuine consultation, if any, and no agreement has been reached. Indeed, two of these schools, Antonio Park and Warranwood Primary—if we go back through the history of them both—were initially allocated $3 million under the BER. One of the things that was done in Victoria at the time was that some schools that did not need quite as much helped out others that needed a bit more and both of these schools voluntarily gave up $500,000 of funding each to put into the eastern region pool so that other schools could benefit from it. Indeed, Heathmont East Primary School, another school I mentioned, is a school that benefited from this. They received an extra $225,000 on top of their $2.5 million, taking it to $2.725 million. But that has gone as well.

It is now time for the Liberal Party and Mr Baillieu to come clean with school councils, parents, teachers and students of these schools and tell them what they have done with the money allocated to their schools under the BER program. This is, of course, federal money. This is money that schools knew they had. They had paperwork that said what they were going to receive. Yet when they come to the end of their build and they say, 'We need to do some more works around the schools and we know we have some money left over,' they will then all of a sudden be told, 'No, you don't.' I do not accept that the Liberal state government of Victoria can just walk in and knock off federal funds allocated to these schools and neither should anyone in the school communities involved.

The locality is in the shire of Dardanup. It is a rapidly growing community in my electorate in the south-west of Western Australia, with a population of over 10,000 people. It is expected to grow to 15,000 people by the end of the decade. Eaton is also a service centre for the surrounding areas of Burekup, Roelands and

At the heart of the Eaton regional community is the Eaton Fair Shopping Centre. Surrounding this are three schools, with two, Glen Huon Primary School and Eaton Community College, in the immediate vicinity. The heart of Eaton also contains the Eaton recreation centre, the library, a day-care centre, shire offices and a medical centre. It is a central hub.

Many of these residents and others of retirement age living elsewhere in Eaton no longer drive but use Gophers and walkers to get to the shopping centre. They do not want to take those Gophers and walkers two kilometres to the next post office. Currently residents have access to a postbox in which they can post their letters at Eaton. They can buy stamps from the great local newsagency. However, they cannot pay their bills, their fines or licence fees.

This is commonly recognised—so much so that private citizens have flocked to sign this petition. I would like to thank Val Melville, the principal petitioner, for her efforts with this petition. A resident of Bethany Fields village, a retirement centre not fair from Eaton Fair, Val is surrounded by those who are demanding this service. She has worked tirelessly to put this together. A total of over 4,637 people have signed this petition asking for the government to take action on their behalf. Nearly half of the local population who have gone out of their way to make an effort to express their views. I urge the government not to ignore them. I again thank Val Melville for all of the work that she has done. The presence of a post office in the Eaton Fair Shopping Centre for these residents is needed, particularly for those who are not in a position to drive or walk the two kilometres to the nearest other post office.

The centenary celebrations were a great opportunity to reflect on the past and to catch up with old friends.

At the celebrations, Lloyd approached Keith, saying, 'You look to be the same vintage as me.' After exchanging names, they started a journey of remembrance, including many stories resulting in much laughter. Keith's daughter Sharon said: 'It was a joy and privilege to see these two gentlemen joined after all these years exchanging stories of behind the shelter shed. They are old Noble Park boys with spirits strong for our great city. Why would you live anywhere else?'

No-one in the Noble Park community would have had a motor vehicle, and many of the students would have come to school by horse. But we are culturally richer now than we have ever been.
                                                                                                                               </p>

Just as Miss Ernst made European fairy stories into Australian stories, students at Noble Park Primary School will make their cultural traditions part of the Australian story. The stories that start at Noble Park primary are the stories of Australia's future.
                                                                                                                               </p>

I wish to congratulate David Rothstadt, the principal at Noble Park primary, and all the staff, parents, friends and students for the enjoyable and well-organised centenary celebrations, for contributing to the ongoing success of this excellent school and for the valuable contribution that they make to our community.

This hospital is an important piece of infrastructure for the people of the Gold Coast. For too long, successive state Labor governments have ignored the very real and growing demand for health services in our city. This project has already been delayed by a number of years as a result of mismanagement by the state Labor government. Now, to rub salt into the wound for the people of the Gold Coast, for my constituents in Moncrieff, we have a situation where the trade union movement continues to flex its muscles in a way that could only be described as demonstrating that they are completely out of control.
                                                                                                                                </p>

We now have a strike that is illegal going into its second week. Further compounding the problem is that, earlier this week, apparently somewhere in the vicinity of several hundred trade unionists from the building site made a convoy into Brisbane and blocked all four lanes of the M1 between the Gold Coast and Brisbane.
                                                                                                                                </p>

It is not fair when that strike action further delays a project that has already been delayed by a couple of years. It certainly is not fair when they continue to hold strike action even though they have been ordered back to work by Fair Work Australia. It is absolutely not fair to those people from my electorate and its surrounds who are simply going about their business travelling to Brisbane for work on a route that is already heavily congested—again, because the state Labor government has not invested in the M1—for there to be a rolling blockade, effectively, of the M1 with tens of thousands of people delayed for in excess of an hour or two on their commute to work.

This project continues to become more expensive as these strikes continue. Most concerningly, in what is an already depressed construction market on the Gold Coast, this sends a very clear message, and that is that anyone looking to develop on the Gold Coast, anyone looking to do any construction activity, needs to be very wary of the trade union movement adding to their costs substantially, because they will take strike action whether it is legal or not. I say, on behalf of the community, it is time they got back to work and dealt with it in the way in which the law intends for it to be dealt with.

The project is an investment in terms of medical facilities in the local community, it will attract health professionals to the area and it will also be a boost to the local economy as the stimulus from the

I was taken to have a look at the current medical centre a couple of years ago. It is an old building made of weatherboard and vertical board.

It is building on other investments that the government has made. Since 2007 we have invested quite heavily in the Huon Valley, with the support of the council. I was able to open the Esperance Multipurpose Health Centre refurbishments just a few weeks ago. I also opened the Huon Doctors Surgery refurbishments, funded by the federal government, and the Geeveston and Dover medical centre refurbishments, also funded by the federal government. The council has been working very hard investing in local health services, with the support of the federal government, in delivering wonderful services to the local community there.

It will also provide training facilities for the training of registrars and medical students. It will be a wonderful investment in that local community. We have been lobbying for a long time for this, and I want to give my thanks to Minister Nicola Roxon for her ongoing support for health care in that area and for the funding that came through the priority round of the health infrastructure fund.

How precious is our sight? Seeing the beauty of the world around us is something many of us would take for granted. But to lose the ability to see would be devastating. Sight is a gift we should not overlook. Macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in Australia, affecting central vision. It is age related, with one in seven people over the age of 50 affected by the disease. The incidence of macular degeneration increases with age. With my electorate of Ryan being home to over 3,000 residents in aged care, it is an issue that is of great importance to me and to those I represent.

With this in mind, the Macular Degeneration Foundation aims to raise awareness of the disease and encourages all Australians, particularly our older Australians, to regularly have their eyes checked—including their macula. The macula is at the very centre of the retina in your eye and is responsible for fine detail and your central vision. You read with your macula, distinguish faces, drive your car—anything that requires detailed vision. It is important to take care of your macula. You cannot change your genes or your age but living a healthy lifestyle, not smoking and eating well can help prevent the onset of the disease.

They have recently launched the Macular Degeneration Research Grants Program, which will provide $1.5 million to researchers in this area over the next three years. The foundation's aim is for Australians to collectively raise $10 million over the next 10 years so that together we can find a cure for the leading cause of blindness in Australia. I encourage everyone to get behind this cause and remember to check your macula.

Statistically, Australians are the most charitable people in the world and, since the Queensland floods and Cyclone Yasi, the way Australians as a nation—sometimes as strangers, or as mates—are simply people who genuinely care is not only exemplary but extraordinary.

In my own electorate of Chifley, people from every background have pitched in and collectively worked towards raising as much money as they can. But, no matter how much money is raised, there is still much more to be done.

We talked about doing something different, something practical, for them and we focused on two schools that would benefit from a helping hand.

Near Ipswich basketball stadium, which was destroyed and will cost about $800,000 to repair, is Bundamba State School. All of its buildings were flooded and school and sporting equipment destroyed.

The Chifley-Blair Sister Schools Project was set up, bringing together members of both the local P&amp;Cs to help raise funds for essential school equipment, in particular sports equipment. On Sunday, 22 May, I hosted a family fun day flood fundraiser for Brassall and Bundamba state schools. The member for Blair attended to talk about his electorate's experience firsthand. His remarks were insightful, personal and emotional and they gave a firsthand perspective of the devastating impact of the floods and the recovery work required. More than 30 members of local P&amp;Cs participated and, through the effort, nearly $4,000 was raised.
                                                                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                                                                    The children at the event painted a banner for the schools as a goodwill gesture. It said: 'A problem shared is a problem halved.' Hopefully, the Chifley-Blair Sister Schools Project has helped lessen some of the burden of rebuilding while demonstrating the power of community from one electorate to another, from one P&amp;C to another and simply from one friend to another.

In particular, I refer today to those areas that receive television through the remote licence area conditions.

The proposal would have seen funding under the Australian government's Satellite Subsidy Scheme pooled and directed towards converting the existing retransmission facilities. The board was merely hoping to replicate a service which has operated successfully for many years. The minister's decision is quite clearly a punch in the guts for people in those communities of rural and remote Australia.

This meant that households, businesses, caravan parks, hotels and motels could receive their television via an antenna. The minister has now decided that the broadcasters will no longer be required to install digital television ground infrastructure for communities with fewer than 500 residents. Remote communities will now be forced to take up the government supported Viewer Access Satellite Television at a cost for connection of between $1,000 and $1,500, which is much more than the government's Satellite Subsidy Scheme cost of $400 in standard areas and $550 in remote areas.

What will happen in these communities under the proposal is that the signal will only be received on a satellite dish. Imagine going to a community today without a mobile phone signal. That is what it will be like in these communities. If you are an outback tourist going into many of these communities, as part of the great outback odyssey, the only way you will be able to receive television is if there is a satellite dish. Hotels are going to have to convert to the satellite signal with their own money. I have hotels and motels in my electorate saying it is going to cost them up to $15,000 to convert because they are moving from a terrestrial signal to a satellite-only solution, and under the terrestrial signal all they had to do was convert some of the televisions in the rooms. It reminds me of the Labor government under

This is yet another example showing that this government does not understand the needs of rural and remote Australia.

As someone who has gone through the difficult, risky, frustrating but deeply rewarding process of starting a small business, I wanted to use my connections and knowledge to help Canberrans to start out on their own. I wanted to do this for two reasons. First, small business provides a means to diversify the Canberra economy and capitalise on all the wonderful talent we have in this city. Second, small business provides a means for giving people opportunities to enter the workforce or employment that is more fitting to their lifestyle. Here I am talking about young mums who have babies at home who want a more flexible and possibly part-time working environment, and small business provides them with that flexibility. I was particularly interested in encouraging women to start their own small business. I know they often have some great ideas and it is just a case of knowing what to do.

I was expecting about 25 people to sign up and actually got double that. All in all, 38 people attended my first business seminar, a number that exceeded my expectations and the actual bookings, to listen to presentations on the processes of how to start a small business and the kinds of things that need to be considered when starting a business. Participants also learnt about various services, networking opportunities and programs run by various groups, both government and nongovernment, that are aimed at assisting small business. They were also provided with information on the many support packages that have been made available to small business under the Gillard government and details of what we are doing for small business in terms of taxation arrangements and assistance to streamline the process of setting up a small business.

When I was at university I was a volunteer tennis coach for the Kids Tennis Foundation and had the privilege of coaching kids with Down syndrome. It opened my eyes.

They each need and deserve our complete support to ensure they have every opportunity available to them. The

To carry on their daily lives they require regular care, support and specialised equipment, services that often come at great cost to families, who are invariably under significant financial pressure. While state and federal governments have already provided significant funding to the disability sector, some $6.2 billion in 2009-10, the system is not working; it is broken. The Productivity Commission's draft report on disability services released in February found that there is a current unmet need for support of $6.3 billion and that too often access to financial support is determined by where someone lives or how they acquired their disability. The draft report also found that people wait years for specialist equipment like wheelchairs, that their funding for service providers was uncertain and inadequate and that there was a distinct lack of access to respite and home modifications, requiring those with disabilities to stay in hospital when it was clearly inappropriate for them to do so.
                                                                                                                                      </p>

With funding to come from consolidated revenue, it is estimated that around 360,000 people will receive scheme funding. Such a system would be more equitable, more efficient and more effective in delivering critical services to people in need. This reform will require bipartisan support and will need the federal, state and territory governments to overcome the argy-bargy of traditional jurisdictional battles. At the federal level the coalition has made clear we are working with good faith with the government, for the status quo is no option.

                                                                                                                                          I rise to support emphatically the omission of words and the change put forward by the member for Goldstein. When we reflect upon this budget in its entirety and the three appropriation bills it is important that we look upon the facts as stated in the budget, starting with the prebudget rhetoric of a tough Labor budget, of tightening of belts, and all we actually see is union mates being rewarded with millions and millions of dollars and $2 billion being slugged out of the pockets of families because of wasteful spending. In this budget the government delivered total savings of only about $2.7 billion over five years where total spending is almost $1.9 trillion. That amounts to 14c in every $100 and the majority of savings do not even come in until 2014-15, miraculously after the government has delivered their long-awaited surplus. As the member for Longman so eloquently put it last night in parliament, 'I celebrate my 21st birthday soon. In that time a Labor government has never delivered a surplus budget.' As all market commentators have agreed, this budget will do nothing to stop interest rate rises. It is also instructive to note that one-third of all Labor's savings are actually new taxes. It is a vagary of taxation law and of the way Treasury operates that a taxation hike is construed as a saving. We note from the budget that the budget deficit for the current year, 2010-11, is soaring to $49.4 billion. The forecast deficit for 2011-12 has blown out by $10.3 billion to a staggering $22.6 billion deficit for the next financial year. The net government debt is climbing to a record $107 billion in 2011-12 and it is forecast to remain at over $100 billion in the foreseeable future, at least to the next four years—that is, net debt of $4,700 for every man, woman and child, for every Australian.

It is a typical, old-fashioned, Labor budget—big on taxes, big on spending, very low on helping householders battle high costs of living, low on helping battlers deal with the high cost of petrol, electricity, gas, groceries, health costs and home repayments.

She was spot on. There is no duplicity here. There is no 'There'll be no carbon tax in my government' here. She was spot on when she said, 'This will be a traditional Labor budget,' and it has been—a huge deficit, huge borrowings, huge debts and huge taxes, all spun with a rhetorical line about being tough. The only thing they are being tough on is their lack of resolve to save money. They talk about the need to repay debt but they lift the debt ceiling to record levels. They talk about easing cost-of-living pressures and then they slug $2 billion out of family assistance to pay for wasteful spending.

On budget night it was revealed to blow out to almost $50 billion, a change of almost $10 billion—they got it wrong. In November we were told that net debt would peak at $94 billion; we are now told it will peak at $107 billion, or a $13 billion blow-out. Not only is net debt to stay above $ 100 billion for at least the next four years but the government will continue to borrow $135 million a day and Labor's debt repayment will be a staggering $7 billion a year. Cumulative interest on Labor 's debt will be more than $26 billion over the next four years. That is the legacy of this Labor government. Think of the infrastructure, the railheads, the ports, the hospitals, the community services that could be funded if this government had not wastefully spent money on recurrent expenses.

I note that it is not as high as the Scandinavian countries that the government likes to point to with respect to good policy, where government spending as a percentage of GDP is up to 50 per cent. Perhaps that is where this government wants to go: the ultimate nanny state. You the taxpayer and I the taxpayer do not know what is good for us, but the nanny Labor government clearly does.

It is the greatest growth in real spending since the disastrous Whitlam years. Yes, Prime Minister, you were spot-on on budget night: this is a traditional Labor budget, boots and all. While the government said it was bound by tight fiscal rules and would offset all new spending with savings measures, the budget papers tell a completely different story. The government cannot even manage to offset new spending in 2011-12, with a $2.3 billion deficit in that area. Of the $21 billion in savings the government claims over the forward estimates, at least 30 per cent of them are new and increased taxes and they will spend $19 billion of it on other stuff. In fact the $1.7 billion flood levy is actually claimed as the biggest saving in the budget. It is staggering that a flood levy is called a saving. It is mind-boggling how much money is being wasted. They could not even find $1.7 billion in a $360 billion budget to deal with natural disasters that are inevitable in a land of drought and flooding rains. It all harks back to pink batts, school halls and $900 cheques, all stuff that our children will pay off because of the reckless spending.

That will stop it.' They have now realised it is the pull factors. It is a complete sham. Labor in opposition prior to 2007 condemned the Howard government for spending an 'abhorrent' $100 million dealing with our borders. They said such expenditure was a tragedy. The Prime Minister, when she was in opposition and we were getting three boats a year, rolled out that great line, 'Another boat, another policy failure.' Well, Prime Minister, we are getting three boats a week and $100 million has now become $1.7 billion. We are now finding the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with his head through a manhole trying to convince asylum seekers to get down from a roof. That is what things have come to with this Labor government.

The carbon tax revenue is nowhere in the budget, nor are any expenses associated with it. This carbon tax is a tax the Prime Minister said would never happen. 'There will be no carbon tax in a government I lead,' she said, hoping to win an election, only to reveal the truth a few days later. Revenue from the mining tax is factored into the budget, yet a tax is not even bedded down and apparently starts on the same day that the carbon tax is meant to start. The carbon tax is not in the budget but the mining tax revenue is. We know the carbon tax will simply export jobs and increase the cost of everything. Let us take cement, for example. The cement process uses a chemical process to release carbon dioxide to take, ostensibly, limestone and reduce it down, and 50 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions in cement production occur through that chemical process. There is no way to improve it and there is no way to rationalise it. Another 35 per cent is in the following processes, before you release the small balls of cement basis, and then 15 per cent is in the large rolling and crushing machines. The bottom line is that there is no way to reduce emissions in the production of cement. So how is the carbon tax going to work in the cement industry? Apart from all cement being imported, all we have done is move emissions offshore. Instead of using power from black coal fired power stations we are going to move emissions offshore to nasty, brown wet coal power stations in China. Emissions will go up and jobs will go down, but apparently this carbon tax is good for us. Revenue from the mining taxes is in the budget; revenue from the carbon tax is not in the budget.

I say to the government: how does your NBN help me with my iPad? How does it help me use my tablet and my mobile communication devices? How can it possibly work? How does it help me use wireless on my laptop? It does not. This is a government picking technology winners because Minister Conroy could not get the 2007 election policy correct of $4.7 billion and broadband to 98 per cent of Australians. On a flight to

Electricity has gone up by 51 per cent since this government came to power. The truth is that $2 billion ripped away from struggling families will hurt them in one shape or form.

They are about assisting those people in our community who are probably more disadvantaged than others and who are in greater need of services. In a moment I will talk about my community and how this budget will be of benefit to them.

I remember that there was a lot of debate at that time about the enormous amount of money that was being spent. I have a recollection of some serious criticism of the government in relation to its insistence on spending a lot of money maintaining one individual on Nauru. I say this because this issue of illegal entrants is a very important issue to this country and it has been for a long period of time. It is an issue that carries many costs, one of which is a financial cost. So if we want to play politics with who is spending more and who is spending less and who is doing a better job of managing this, my view is that we need to look at the global situation and put our problem in the context of what is going on internationally. We might find that other regions in the world, especially in Europe, shoulder a greater burden of illegal entrants than this country does. I do not want to downplay the significance of the problem for Australia, but I want to make this point because we talk about it all the time without thinking.

So we need to keep it in perspective.

I am particularly pleased to speak to it because the budget has introduced a very significant initiative aimed at assisting people back into the workforce. I know that we talk about this all the time. All governments talk about their desire to help people get back into the workforce, and lots of programs are devised and lots of money is spent to help people, whether they are from the disability sector, young people or mature age workers. This is a problem that has been with us for some time. We spend a lot of money and a lot of words on trying to get people back into work. We do that because it is very important for people to be working. Having a constructive life—one in which you are responsible for your day-to-day living—is very important. The dignity of work adds to the dignity of self. There are a whole series of other important psychological factors there, so we talk a lot about getting people into work.
                                                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                                                            <p>

My electorate has a very high rate of unemployment for young people—probably one of the highest in the country. It has been like that for a long period of time. There are a lot of reasons why that is the case. Over my years as the member I have always been perplexed—like a lot of our service deliverers—as to why we cannot succeed in reducing that unemployment level. One of the reasons is that, while there are a lot of services provided, at some point people are not getting the best information regarding how they can either get a job or get the relevant training necessary to get them into long-term employment.

                                                                                                                                             Someone has finally decided to acknowledge this and try and do something about it. The government, through this budget, has announced a $304 million package that is aimed squarely at the unemployed and in particular the youth unemployed and those on long-term income support, the most vulnerable people and the people who need the greatest assistance and support to get into the workforce. The $304 million package involves 10 locations in the country. This is a package that requires the local communities to develop a structure. My electorate of Calwell is one of those 10 locations. The Hume City Council, which shares, as I have said many times before, the same borders as the federal seat of Calwell, is one of the local government authorities to have been chosen. I make the point that the package is an initiative of this budget, it is a very important initiative and it is part of the budget's aim to build a bigger workforce. We do this through more targeted investment in skills and training and through all sorts of measures to encourage participation. But, more importantly, through this program we will do it by actually helping people to learn about the prospects and those things that are available to them in the community so they can actually be helped. Not too much attention has been paid to that aspect of it in the past. We do this at a time—and, again, I speak very much about my electorate—when it is expected that, nationwide, unemployment will fall from its current level of about five per cent to about 4.5 per cent during the next two years. It is expected that half a million new jobs will be created. I know that they are only figures but, obviously, the people that cast the economic trends have a fair idea of where the employment prospects are in this country. There is no doubt that we have great potential for growth in Australia. We acknowledge that a shortage of participants in the workforce will be one of our drawbacks if we do not address it. We need to do that at a time when people, such as those in my electorate, are experiencing higher unemployment than the national average.
                                                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                                                             The intention of this $304 million initiative is to not only assist those people in my electorate but also provide a structure that they themselves create, not one that is imposed from above but one that is developed from the ground and responds specifically to the issues that prevent people from availing themselves of programs. It is the local community on the ground that will decide how it creates a pathway for its community. Of the $304 million funding, $38.2 million over four years will be allocated to support this local workforce participation through what will be called the Community Innovation through Collaboration initiative. Collaboration, I think, is the key word here, because it will work with all the stakeholders and the service deliverers.

                                                                                                                                             The sum of $25 million has been allocated for a Local Solutions Fund for community organisations to deliver the programs, as I said, to help access educational and employment options, and a further $13.2 million has been set aside to provide service coordinators and community based facilitators. Whilst it is important for the community to be brought together to actually develop a structure to assist itself, it is necessary to have an overall coordinator who is not necessarily attached to any of the major bureaucracies but who is there to assist the community and help them work their way through the plan of action that I am looking forward to my community putting together in the next few months.

                                                                                                                                             I was very pleased about this announcement. When I got back to my electorate last week I thought it would be absolutely important to hit the ground running on this one. I recognise that we have an opportunity to shape and mould this program. I am happy to report to the House that we called together some of our major local stakeholders to brief them about the government's package and to discuss how they saw this potential and how they thought we could bring it all together so that it could maximise the benefits for our people.

I decided that I would invite a core group of people from my electorate—the key stakeholders—who I thought would serve as the initial consultation group. I want to list them because they are very important people not only to me as a member of parliament but also to my community. I want to start by mentioning Mr Tony Coppola, who is the senior manager at Northern Melbourne Regional Development Australia. They are responsible for building partnerships between all levels of government, local business, community groups and key regional stakeholders in order to provide responses to economic, environmental and social issues affecting all of Melbourne's north. Mr Coppola is also a representative of

Bridge of Hope is a registered charity that specialises in training and providing job opportunities for troubled youth and those in juvenile detention. The group of young people who are referred to as juvenile offenders—I have a very large number of those young people in my electorate—is one that we tend to forget about. We do not even talk about them, let alone try and devise opportunities for them. These are a particularly vulnerable group of young people because they have special needs. Many of them will end up in juvenile detention for a whole series of reasons which I will not go into. The key is what happens to them when they get out. Many of them will only be 16, 17 or 18—young people who need to be assisted back either into education or into some sort of training and given an opportunity. Often people do not want to deal with juvenile offenders, they do not want them.

I would probably face discrimination if I were suddenly to become unemployed—the discrimination that comes with being a mature-age person. It might mortify me to think that, but my age might be a problem for me in the workforce. These young people have all sorts of other problems. They are not as empowered as I or someone else may be. They need a fair go and they do not get a fair go. We need to change attitudes towards them before we can even help them. So I want to commend John Walsh and the Bridge of Hope, which hopes to do a lot of work in this area but needs to partner with government. I invited him to this meeting because I think they have a very important role to play.

Brite is one of those extraordinary organisations that I have had the pleasure of representing. Brite is probably the only Australian disability enterprise in this country. It is an organisation that specialises in the employment of people with disabilities. I say it is unique because it started off being a sheltered workshop some 25 years ago when we did refer to these organisations as sheltered workshops. Thankfully, we all learnt that that was not very flattering language to use. These are people with special needs but nevertheless they like to work and Brite offers them long-term employment and they have become a thriving business. I am very proud of Brite because they have managed to win contracts for their people and there is a long future ahead for the people who work at Brite.

Ian is from the Broadmeadows Community Neighbourhood Renewal Project, which comprises another set of people who specialise in assisting the most vulnerable. Finally, I invited the CEO of Spectrum Migrant Resource Centres, Mrs Rosemary Kelada. Spectrum does an incredible amount of work for new immigrants in my electorate. They implement Australia's very successful settlement services. Unfortunately, I am running out of time, but I want to thank them for coming to that meeting and I look forward to working with them in the next few months to implement the government's program.

Firstly I want to highlight the need for the federal government to support an application for $65 million to expand and enhance the Latrobe Regional Hospital under the Health and Hospitals Fund regional priority round. This application is for funding to build a new improved emergency department and additional endoscopy facilities and offer more beds for acute care.

Gippsland has some of the poorest health outcomes in Victoria. Current facilities fall well below existing standards and are not adequate to meet growing community needs, which are affecting LRH's ability to meet its designated role as a regional hospital and a teaching facility. This situation will be exacerbated in the future with predicted growth in demand of 13 per cent over the next 10 years. It is critical in that regard that the federal government recognises the growth that is going on in the

With an ageing population, the increase in demand on our health services is apparent and I encourage the federal government to continue to invest in facilities at LRH in particular. The improved facilities and the increased capabilities will also make it easier for us to recruit and train medical specialists in the region and reduce the burden on Melbourne health services. Naturally there is a double benefit in that regard—we can actually service more people in our local communities rather than having them be forced to go to Melbourne, adding to the waiting lists in Melbourne. This is an opportunity for us in regional areas. I am advised that the cost of unnecessary patient transport at the moment is in the vicinity of $29 million a year, and that money could be recouped by government as a result of expanding this facility so that more patients can be treated in the Latrobe Valley.

People are making the decision that it is all too hard to go to Melbourne, find accommodation and access services in the city. I admit it is hard to measure this particular issue, but I constantly receive anecdotal information about people from the more remote parts of my region who are choosing not to pursue advanced treatment because they have to go to Melbourne. It is a key concern for us in our regional communities.

I would like to congratulate the federal government and the state government for continuing the level of bipartisan support for this magnificent facility. The Gillard government has supported the community fundraising efforts by providing $1.5 million for the next stage of the development, which will see nine more units being built. I actually inspected the progress on these units only a few weeks ago and I can report to the House that all is going very well there. It is going to be a magnificent addition to this facility, which has been such a crucial part of providing accommodation and care for people as they are away from their home at a very stressful time in their lives. I do take this opportunity to encourage the minister to visit our region for the official opening of this facility. It would be great to see her there for the occasion, which we hope will be towards the end of this year. I am sure she will be impressed by the work of local builders. I congratulate the organisers and the board of management for engaging the local building firms to undertake this project.

                                                                                                                                              The planned upgrade that we are talking about is stage 2A of a larger redevelopment, so we are talking about substantial amounts of money. A master plan has been endorsed by the Victorian Department of Health, under both the previous Labor state government and the current coalition government. The project does have government support. It also has widespread community support, particularly the rebuilding of the hospital's emergency department where waiting times have become an issue of increasing concern. I have a great deal of sympathy for the staff at the front-line of the emergency department. They often cop all the poor headlines in terms of people being forced to wait for treatment and to wait on trolleys for extended periods of time. The staff bear the brunt of that criticism when, really, they are completely overwhelmed by the demand for services. I do encourage the federal government to continue to work with the state government on this most important upgrade and opportunity to expand the facilities at LRH.
                                                                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                                                                              On another positive note, it would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity now to mention the $23 million worth of funding announced by the federal government on 7 April last year. This funding was to expand the Gippsland Cancer Care Centre and provide an additional 414 radiation treatments and 8,000 chemotherapy treatments. I understand expressions of interest will be advertised next week for construction on this project. Again, it is a project which is much needed, tragically, in my community. The expansion of the Gippsland Cancer Care Centre will make LRH one of the prime facilities for the delivery of cancer care services in Victoria and according to LRH staff this funding will allow for a significant expansion of the radiotherapy, chemotherapy and dialysis units as well as an expansion to the pharmacy. It is tragic but it is a fact of life in my region that there is a growing need for cancer treatment in the broader Gippsland community and it is essential that patients can access these services in our region. The expansion will make LRH a leader in this area as the cancer centre doubles in size. On behalf of my community, I do welcome the funding from the federal government in that regard.
                                                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                                                                              It is also important, in the context of that federal funding, to mention the fact—and reflect on it—of the inspirational efforts of the local community and the financial contribution they have been able to make to support this initiative. The Gippsland Cancer Care Centre has been the beneficiary of many fundraising events in recent years, several of which I have had the opportunity to attend. They have always been very well run. I refer to things like gala balls and community fun runs. It is a remarkable effort when you look at the socioeconomics of my community. They have been able to raise in excess of $3.5 million since the Gippsland Cancer Centre Appeal was launched in 2003. That is in addition to the fundraising that has been going on for Gippsland Rotary Centenary House. So I do take this opportunity to thank my community for their work in that regard. I thank the various board members who have served as volunteers on those fundraising committees, the business sponsors, the philanthropic organisations and the members of the broader general public who have been prepared to give their time and their money in such a generous manner. I think regional communities are renowned for such efforts and it is a real tribute to the people of Gippsland that they are such committed stakeholders in our health services. Although I have focused a lot on the Latrobe Valley here today, let me assure the House that right across my region there are auxiliaries and community based boards which are doing an extraordinary job every day of the week to supplement whatever government funding is available through the various health budgets. Without the efforts of these volunteers the health situation in every part of Gippsland would be far worse.

I would also like to refer to comments from a nearby resident who has written to the federal minister for regional development to raise her concerns in this regard. The letter describes the situation in Bairnsdale:
                                                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                                                             <p class="italic">
                                                                                                                                              Since 2003 we have had a problem with bats. The bats have created a very comfortable colony amongst the residents of Bairnsdale, which increases by the year and have extended to 33,000 in number at times … As we have had an unusually wet year, the putrid smell has become unbearable for anyone living within the town.
                                                                                                                                             </p>

It is worth reflecting that the poplar trees are an introduced species and they are affected by white ants, in this particular case. The resident is critical of the lack of action by the Department of Sustainability of Environment, and I quote her again:
                                                                                                                                             </p>

We feel that if the trees (which are considered dangerous and overhang a public footpath/bicycle track along the river banks) are removed, the bats are intelligent enough to find another forested area (of which there is plenty in the Gippsland area) in which to live.
                                                                                                                                             </p>

The report also states that they wish to educate us on the benefits of 'co-habiting with wildlife'. We think that this is plain stupidity given that the people writing these reports do not live anywhere near the bats and consequently, do not have to tolerate the constant noise and putrid stench from these animals, with which we have to live.
                                                                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                                                                              Having had the opportunity to inspect the colony personally, I have to agree with the letter writer: there is a stench associated with the flying foxes. The quality of life of nearby residents is being severely compromised and the constant noise is having an impact on people's health—and that is without even considering the issue of disease which may be borne by the flying foxes. So this warning from Victoria's chief health officer will, I think, escalate the concerns within my community. At a local level I have been working with my local state MP, Tim Bull, who I know is trying to find a way through the layers of bureaucracy to resolve the situation. At a federal level I will be seeking assurances from the federal government that it will not be using the provisions of the

The location of the colony is a real problem for my community, and the local agencies need to develop a management plan which balances difficult environmental issues but clearly places the rights of the human population ahead of the flying foxes.

I have raised this issue in the House on several occasions in the past. I have also raised it directly with the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and, to be fair to the minister, he has given me a fair hearing in this matter. I have tabled petitions from my community, which reflects the level of concern throughout the Broader Gippsland region. The Princes Highway east of Sale is currently not eligible for Commonwealth funding in any form whatsoever; it is a responsibility primarily of the state government. The highway from Sale to Traralgon has been the beneficiary of about $140 million of federal funding under a joint project to see some duplication works undertaken. That does not gel with the people of Gippsland. It does not make sense for them that such a major highway, which is in desperate need of government funding to improve it from Sale to the

The stretch of highway I am talking about has one of the highest accident and fatality rates in Victoria. Tragically, there was another death this week. Hardly a month goes by without a fatality on that road. I am not saying every accident is a result of the condition of the road, but there is no question that it is a contributing factor to the high accident and fatality rates.

We also want the state minister to assist us in lobbying the federal government to make the highway east of Sale eligible for Commonwealth funding.

With an increase in the use of the road by large recreational vehicles, along with the increased size of the commercial vehicles on the road—the trucks, the caravans and those large Winnebago type vehicles—we are seeing a very close interface between large vehicles when they pass each other on some sections of the road, particularly east of Orbost to the New South Wales border, where there is no shoulder for more than 40 kilometres. The margin for error is so small that we desperately need to do something about it. I fear that we are going to have a major accident on the road involving a bus carrying children or tourists through the region and it is going to take a situation like that before the state and federal governments recognise their responsibilities to undertake a major program of upgrading this stretch of highway. In my view, too much of the current debate about highway funding east of Sale is based on anecdotal evidence.

I believe that there is a real opportunity here for both the state and the federal road ministers to work in partnership with my community. I invite both the state and the federal road ministers to come to Gippsland, take a firsthand look at the road and see for themselves the risks that our motorists are faced with on a daily basis.

There is no doubt that Australia dealt with the global financial crisis better than most. None of these outcomes would have been possible without the two stimulus packages that kept Australians in jobs. Although there are many Australians feeling the cost-of-living pressures, including in my electorate of Reid, it would have been much worse if the Labor government had not acted as swiftly and decisively as we did and the opposition had had their way, which was to cut millions of jobs.

That helped our country weather the storm. The 2011-12 budget is about keeping the economy healthy. We must not rest on our laurels. We must continue to strengthen our economy and create new opportunities. That is why this budget will get us back in the black by 2012-13 and spread the opportunities of the mining boom. As with all good governments, we must consider the context of our fiscal position and plan for an even better future, noting all of the obstacles and constraints. For the Gillard government, the expected tax collection over the last two years has been cut by $16 billion, as a result of historic national natural disasters, the

These investments will ease capacity constraints in these tight economic times.

Ai Group argued hard for this, and we are delighted to see the proposals included in the Budget.

Another major role of the agency will be to administer the new Workforce Development Fund. As part of the focus on jobs, a new Workforce Development Fund will be created to respond to the most critical emerging skills needed in Australia and is expected to deliver 130,000 new training places over four years.

This includes investing in a national apprenticeship mentoring program to support apprentices to finish their training, and developing new apprenticeship models that allow apprentices to develop faster and that recognise prior learning.

With joint funding from the federal government and the Catholic Education Office, today the college is a state-of-the-art trade training centre with over 100 students already enrolled.
                                                                                                                                              </p>

Fortunately this did not occur, and I was very pleased to welcome the Prime Minister to Reid only a few weeks ago, and specifically to the Southern Cross Catholic Vocational College in Burwood, where she witnessed firsthand the state-of-the-art facilities on offer for students. The Prime Minister met some of our future mechanics, future beauticians and future carpenters. The Prime Minister even gave a short interview with aspiring journalists as part of their media studies—a recording that they will surely keep for posterity.

The initiatives continue to assist skills development in many different learning environments, and I welcome these initiatives.

The cadetships will be delivered through the trade training centres and other eligible venues, with up to 50,000 additional structured work experience places provided to students.

That is why I am so pleased that this government is funding 30,000 additional places for jobseekers in the Language, Literacy and Numeracy Program. Without basic literacy, many people are condemned to a life of little opportunity and, sadly, in many cases, long-term unemployment. Our government has committed to changing this by providing long-term job seekers with critical skills to allow them to participate more fully in the workforce. This additional funding is targeted at job seekers who are registered with Centrelink and are identified as experiencing significant disadvantage in the labour market due to low levels of language, literacy and/or numeracy. These are targeted programs where each participant is given an individual training plan which is tailored to meet their specific needs. The training program is typically face-to-face and can be vocationally oriented. For those who are struggling in a large group setting, there is the opportunity for them to engage in small group training.

Without literacy, these Australians are vulnerable. It is important that Australians who struggle with literacy do not feel ashamed and, instead, take action and are helped to improve their skills. Our government is supporting these vulnerable Australians to do just that. We are helping to break the long-term cycles of lost opportunity and unemployment by supporting Australians who need help with basic literacy to improve their skills and, in turn, improve their job prospects. None of the unemployed people I speak to really want to be reliant on unemployment benefits. The people I speak to want to work, and this initiative will help some of the most vulnerable in our society to be able to do just that. On this point, I note that our government believes in ensuring everyone is given the support and the skills they need to seek out employment. With unemployment at low levels, this indicates the government is on the right track.

We acknowledge and value the challenging but important job done by teachers throughout Australia, particularly those who teach students with disabilities. That is why our government will invest $200 million over three years to support students with disabilities in their classrooms and improve their learning opportunities. I believe this is due recognition of the need to improve support for students with disabilities. I am confident this added support will not only directly benefit students but will also be of immense benefit and assistance to their teachers. I commend the Treasurer for this investment and I am pleased to note that this investment has been welcomed by the

For higher education, the government is making the significant investment of a further $1.4 billion to meet the demand for growth in university enrolments. In this year alone the extra funding will provide 480,000 undergraduate places. Funding will also aim to upgrade infrastructure at regional tertiary institutions and assist universities to support, attract and retain students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Despite the tough decisions on savings measures that our government made in this budget, education was one area where we did not hesitate to provide further assistance. The federal Labor government has nearly doubled the national education budget because it is core to our belief that education is essential to our long-term prosperity. A community with excellent skills has enhanced opportunities and can remain competitive in a global labour market. We are a government that believes in providing all Australians, irrespective of their background, the opportunity and encouragement to achieve that potential. There is only one area that could be more important than education, and that is health. Nothing is more important than the health of our family and friends.

The Gillard government is making an unprecedented investment of $3 billion in health reform right across Australia. Notably, the government has made the largest Commonwealth commitment to mental health services in Australia's history, including $1.5 billion worth of investment in this budget. The $2.2 billion mental health reform package targets funding where the services in those communities need it most, with a total of 90 headspace clinics, as well as early detection to support young people with mental illness.

MRI services at Concord Hospital have been of invaluable benefit for the health outcomes of my constituents, and I am very pleased that the minister has announced that our government will be extending Medicare funding to cover the cost of more MRI scans than ever before in both metropolitan and, importantly, regional areas of Australia. Moreover, the package announced by the minister will also help to reduce the cost of MRI services by increasing the bulkbilling incentives for MRI services. I have seen firsthand the importance of access to these services, and I am delighted that these benefits are being extended to even more Australians.

I am very pleased that our government will establish a voluntary dental internship program to encourage graduates to expand their skills and work in the public dental system. The increase in the number of graduates will improve the access to much needed dental services.

I commend the Treasurer for making the tough decisions without compromising the vital areas of training, education and health. This is a budget that will stand our country in good stead for the future and will allow us to return to surplus by 2012-13. I stress again that we are leading the world in all the

And in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the dreadful natural disasters that inflicted our country last year and earlier this year, this government is proving once and for all that we are very, very economically responsible and any thought that the Labor Party in federal government cannot manage the economy should be allowed to rest once and for all. We are the envy of the world and it is little wonder so much capital is powering into our country and the value of our dollar is so high.

The waste that this government has overseen goes right back to 2007. We have seen programs, which may have been started with the best of intentions, that have blown out and not delivered—the school halls, the pink batts and the $900 cheques that went out during the stimulus package. The school halls program has a legacy that is still playing out in my electorate.

This has all the potential to go the same way as the pink batts and the school halls. It is a $308 million program and is valued at $400 per person. A couple of weeks ago I was in a large electrical retailer in Canberra and you could buy a new digital television for less than that. So I think that, once again, while the intention may have been honourable, I believe this is going to get lost in the delivery.
                                                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                                                Some of the alarming figures to come out of this budget are that the deficit has soared to $49.4 billion and net government debt has climbed to $107 billion. That puts government borrowing at $135 million a day. The interesting part is that the mining tax was mentioned in this year's budget but the carbon tax, which is due to be implemented on the same day, was not. While the intention behind the carbon tax may be to help boost the government's bottom line, it will rip the heart and soul out of Australia, no more so than in the electorate that I represent. Before the previous incarnation of the carbon tax, the emissions trading scheme, Professor Garnaut's report indicated that regional Australia would have an economic downturn of 20 per cent under the implementation of an emissions trading scheme while the cities would have one of eight per cent. The question I would like to ask is: why is regional Australia being asked to pay a large part of the burden for this grand gesture to prove that Australia cares about the environment more than anyone else in the world? The issue here is not whether you believe that the climate is changing and not whether you believe that man's activity has anything to do with it; the issue here is whether what has been proposed is going to have any effect on the climate. It certainly will have an effect in my electorate, which relies a lot on fossil fuel. We have a high freight component for everything that comes and goes, for the goods that we need and for the produce that we produce. We have a high fuel component in the crops that we grow and in the mining sector. Due to the fact that we live in a harsh climate, we rely heavily on energy to keep ourselves cool in summer and warm in winter. I fear what the proposed increases to electricity prices are going to do to the people of my electorate and to the most vulnerable, the pensioners, in my electorate. The Meals on Wheels volunteers were telling me last winter, even before the implementation of the tax, just with the increase in electricity prices so far, that when they were delivering meals to pensioners they were finding many of them in bed at midday, not because they were unwell but because they were frightened to turn on the heater because they worried about the cost of electricity.
                                                                                                                                               </p>
                                                                                                                                               <p>
                                                                                                                                                The other issue is that in some ways it could have the opposite effect. In one small town, Mendooran, the supermarket owner told me that he is paying between $6,000 and $7,000 a quarter for his electricity. If that increases by 20 or 30 per cent and he becomes unviable and cannot keep his doors open, the 400 residents of that village will have no choice but to travel the 70 kilometres each way to Dubbo to purchase their basic requirements. I would think that would have a much larger effect on emissions and a negative effect on the environment.
                                                                                                                                               </p>

We will still require cement as one of the basic products that we use for road building and housing construction. We use a lot of cement. That will now be imported from elsewhere in the world. So, while there will be still the same emissions, or possibly a few more if it is going to a

Indeed, I think that the numbers of people now who gain employment from mining are probably similar to those involved in agriculture—it has moved at such a rate. The mining tax also underpins a lot of the promises that have been made to regional Australia for spending, so a lot of these announcements, certainly in the forward estimates of this budget, coming to regional Australia are very much contingent on the mining tax. The one hand giveth and the other taketh away. Certainly that is a great concern to the people that I represent.

The great irony of that is that a large part of the Parkes electorate was flooded, maybe not as spectacularly as in some areas of Queensland but certainly with just as much devastation. Fortunately we did not have the loss of life that the people in Queensland had. It was a different flood. We had areas from late November right through till March that were affected by this flooding. While I think that nearly $800 million has been paid out by the government under the Australian government disaster relief program, very little of that has been available to my electorate. I made representations to the Attorney-General and he seemed to understand the case. He put out a press release naming 13 local government areas in the Parkes electorate that would be eligible for the Australian government disaster relief payment. But when those people fronted at Centrelink they were refused. The fine print said that, for them to be affected, the water had to have come from Queensland. I want to know why the water from Queensland is more devastating than the water in the Macquarie Valley, the Cudgegong Valley, the Namoi Valley and indeed the Castlereagh.

One lady in the village of Quambone has a severely disabled son who was stranded on an electric bed for two days while they had no power. I am not blaming the budget for that; that is what happens, but she has been refused the government disaster relief payment because the water that surrounded Quambone and took out the power did not come in from Queensland. Residents of Goodooga were isolated for a couple of months because of water that came from Queensland; but they were refused payment because they were not deemed 'isolated', because they could walk from house to house—but there are no shops in Goodooga. They were isolated from

They had to rely on flood boats and they had to pay high prices for produce that was brought it. I find that quite mean-spirited and it was devastating to these people.

We are not talking huge numbers, but a considerable number of people in my electorate who were severely impacted by the flood, had considerable loss and inconvenience, are now paying a levy to other parts of Australia. I understand that in some suburbs of Brisbane people were eligible for that payment merely because the power was disconnected for a couple of days—and I am not talking about the areas that were impacted by floodwater—but that is an anomaly and something I have been having a battle about since the end of January. It has caused a great degree of resentment and frustration with my constituents.

Once again, students in Mudgee and Dubbo, considered inner regional areas, have missed out. For some reason they were considered not isolated and have not been eligible for the independent youth allowance. Hopefully the inquiry that is being undertaken at the moment will rectify that.

It is one of the key pieces of infrastructure that not only will be of benefit to the people of the Parkes electorate but I believe will be of benefit to Australia as a whole. Certainly, the cities of Brisbane and Melbourne will also gain from that. But it was a little concerning yesterday in Senate estimates when

But this government removed $50 million and allocated $7.1 million to the Dubbo hospital. I think that was very short-sighted. It would make perfect sense to do this hospital in one go rather than in lots of little stages. The people of Dubbo were certainly disappointed by that change of heart. Thank you.

These bills will help ensure that the benefits of a strong economy flow to each and every corner of our nation. New programs in the budget will help get more people into work and train them for more rewarding jobs. Just as the government's focus on protecting Australian jobs during the global recession helped to position our economy as the envy of the world, our focus on jobs when times improve will ensure that we maximise our advantages into the future. Unlike the previous Liberal government, this Labor government is not complacent as the sun begins to shine. As former

Our plan for better schools, hospitals and health care includes a total of $2.2 billion for mental health services and $1.8 billion for regional health facilities, and there is cost-of-living relief for families, investments in a sustainable Australia and new assistance for small business and manufacturers, all while making the difficult decisions necessary to get back into the black by 2012-13, years ahead of the major advanced economies.

The budget backs up the government's agenda to modernise the delivery of public services. In 2011-12 the government is investing $113½ million in service delivery reform. This vital reform program will deliver more one-stop shops, more self-service and more intensive support for people who need it. It will make public services more accessible, more convenient, more efficient and more targeted at the needs of individual Australians and their families. The new budget funding for service delivery reform is the culmination of a process that began when my predecessor,

For customers, service delivery reform will drag the way the government deliver services away from low-tech, inefficient practices into the 21st century. It will provide more one-stop shops, better self-service options and more intensive support, as I said.

Staff will be able to go beyond their traditional roles and provide more hands-on assistance to people in real need in ways that cut across traditional silos and responsibilities. For the government, our plans will allow us to deliver services more efficiently and cost effectively by getting rid of unnecessary paperwork, combining back-office functions and refocusing resources on those people who need the most help.

The budget includes $19½ million to extend the successful Local Connections to Work program. In the first seven months of this program there has been a 50 per cent higher job placement rate for job seekers who had been through the service. The new funding will continue to support the program at the nine sites where it is already operating and will allow us to open five new sites a year between 2012-13 and 2014-15.

Local Connections to Work provides tailored assistance that caters to the specific needs of disadvantaged job seekers in selected deeply disadvantaged locations. The service brings a range of services together under one roof that job seekers can then access more conveniently. At each site, a range of different service providers are rostered on to deliver services from the Centrelink office. The roster arrangement means that during an appointment a customer will have the opportunity to talk with a number of other services right there on site to provide the assistance they need to overcome their employment barriers. Where a particular service is not available on site, job seekers are helped to connect with that service off site.

Those meetings can extend to other community partners with the consent of the job seeker to identify their needs and quickly link them to the right support. This closer collaboration between Centrelink and other relevant agencies gives a more holistic view of the job seeker who, in most instances, will only need to tell their story once.

The budget also includes funding for 44 case coordination trial sites around Australia. The first 19 case coordination sites will be rolled out in 2011-12, and 10 of those 19 locations are the same locations where the government is making extra investments through the participation agenda. Case coordination under service delivery reform will identify people in need of more intensive support and connect them to appropriate services. In the future, case coordination has the potential to be a far-reaching program and it is a key part of the government's broader agenda to modernise the delivery of public services to Australians and their families.

The program will assist job seekers, but importantly will go far deeper than that. It will also support people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, the recently bereaved, people in legal or financial difficulty, carers, people with mental health concerns, people with gambling dependency, and people with drug and alcohol issues. There will be different levels of service to reflect an individual's different level of need. Services will range from simple referrals, such as a training program or information about available services, to intensive support involving multiple coordinated appointments with non-government and local community services. A designated staff member will help customers, including by assisting them in their dealings with multiple government agencies like Centrelink, Medicare and the Australian tax office and giving them information about local services—for example,

The co-location of Centrelink and Medicare offices into one-stop shops will provide much more convenient and accessible services in one location. The program will significantly improve the way public services are delivered throughout the community. By providing more than 500 new one-stop shops for public services across the nation, we can greatly improve access to those services, particularly for Australians living in rural and regional areas. The new offices will provide better access to Centrelink and Medicare services, from applying for Medicare rebates to making inquiries about family payments, all in one convenient location. That is great news for people in regional and rural areas in particular who may never before have had a Medicare office in their community.

The budget also includes a $24½ million investment to improve services for Australians in regional and remote areas and for the socially isolated. This new funding will extend the successful mobile office service and will provide many more outreach officers to help people in need. It will make it easier for Australians who live in rural and regional areas, as well as the socially isolated, to access government services and payments. The government's mobile offices made a huge difference during the recent floods, as well as during the drought, and so we are extending this vital service beyond 1 July 2011.

In the past these offices were deployed to areas affected by drought, but more recently they were used in Queensland following last summer's natural disasters. Continued funding for the mobile offices and the introduction of a third office in 2014 will benefit up to half a million Australians who live more than 50 kilometres from a Medicare or Centrelink office.

There are already 90 of these officers working at targeted sites across the country and they do a terrific job. They deliver essential outreach services outside the traditional office setting to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. They go to boarding houses, drop in centres and other places where people sleep rough to help them claim and maintain income support payments as well as provide referrals to other support programs.

Through these significant investments in the government's service delivery reform agenda, taxpayers will also save $130 million over four years through improved information and self-service facilities across the Human Services Portfolio. By reducing paperwork, moving forms online and improving the single portfolio website and phone number we are providing more self-service options for people who want to do business with the portfolio in that way. This will make contacting and accessing the services of Human Services agencies simpler for millions of Australians. That is just a quick snapshot of what we will deliver through service delivery reform.

We will be delivering more targeted assistance to help job seekers who are capable of work to find employment. A key component of this package is the $38.2 million investment in a new program, the Community Innovation through Collaboration initiative. The program will encourage local innovation to boost the life skills and work readiness of people with multiple and complex needs. It will be rolled out in the 10 locations around Australia that receive additional assistance through place based programs and support services. The program will ensure that the needs of local communities are addressed with well-resourced, collaborative and effective local solutions rather than a one-size-fits-all program that is controlled from Canberra.

By investing in local solutions the government can better assist local communities to address disadvantage, through tailored initiatives that draw on local expertise.

The program will give locals a say, making sure that groups that help local people are actively involved in developing and delivering local solutions that address the limitations of existing services. By investing and modernising the delivery of public services as well as new programs to boost workforce participation, the government is ensuring that my portfolio will continue to make a positive difference to the lives of millions of Australians.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation, which appropriates the funding sought through yet another Labor budget built on deficit, borrowing and debt. This is a typical Labor budget. We heard the government speak of a budget containing tough decisions but, once again, the government's spin and rhetoric fail to be matched by its actions.

In the true Labor tradition the budget crowds out the private sector at every opportunity in order to prop up its forecast of a 2012-13 surplus. That will only happen by the government manipulating the figures again next year.
                                                                                                                                                 </p>

In November, we were told that net debt would peak at $94 billion. On budget night it was revealed that net debt is now $107 billion, and the government is borrowing $153 million every single day. Each day we have the government out there competing against private enterprise and small business for funding and putting pressure on interest rates paid by small business and homeowners.
                                                                                                                                                 </p>

So, instead of making tough decisions to produce a surplus, instead of cutting back on its spending, the government is simply increasing its debt limit and borrowing more and more taxpayers' money. Any surplus will be illusory as long as the government is paying back the debt. Cumulative interest on Labor's net debt will be more than $26 billion over the next four years. The repayments on government debt will be billions more than any surplus predicted by the government over the next four years. It is a budget built on debt and spending, and small business and householders and families will be the ones who have to pay. The Treasurer does not understand the impact of spending on interest rates. It is basic economics that record government spending and waste will increase the money supply in the economy and inflate prices. The

Interest-rate rises are not only hurting businesses but they are also increasing the cost of living. This government simply does not understand that there are many individuals and families feeling the pressure of cost of living and this budget does very little to help them. Again the government could help with inflationary pressures in the economy by easing spending and reducing government debt and competition in the credit markets.

Businesses operating in slow sectors are raising prices to deal with a combination of reduced returns, increased funding costs and higher interest rates brought about by this government. Labor simply does not understand that the government spending is inflationary and increasing inflationary pressures are adding into the cost of living. Aggregate annual inflation is currently 3.3 per cent, just about the Reserve Bank's target. But the aggregate figure does not give the full picture. According to the Reserve Bank, food prices are inflating by 11.5 per cent annualised. This has been constant over the past six months, well before the natural disasters hit Queensland. Transport costs have inflated in the March quarter by 10.6 per cent annualised, and this is hitting family budgets, workers and small business right across the country.

A snapshot of the Cowper electorate provides insight into why this is so. In approximate terms the Cowper electorate has 20,000 age pensioners, 5,000 people receiving carers allowance, 9,000 on the disability support pension and 15,000 receiving Family Tax Benefit A and 11,000 receiving Family Tax Benefit B. Twenty per cent of families have only one parent and 37 per cent of couples have children. For the majority of those people the budget fails the very fundamental test of providing assistance with the increased costs of living. Indeed, the reality is that this budget locks in the Gillard government agenda, which will actually deliver a double-whammy to North Coast residents. In the first instance the budget fails to acknowledge that the rising cost of living is impacting on many low-income families and that their inflationary experience is far greater than the headline figures that are published from the Reserve Bank. Secondly, this government has made it clear that they intend to squeeze household budgets further by introducing a carbon tax. And they will be increasing it afterwards. That is one of the sinister things about this tax, that they will slip it in at a relatively low rate and then they will ramp it up. Watch this space. That will drive up the cost of everything.

I often wonder about the Prime Minister and Treasurer, I must say, but going through the aisles at Coles I wondered when was the last time the Prime Minister cruised down to the grocery store and when was the last time the Treasurer cruised down to the grocery store to buy some groceries. I guess the truth is that neither the Treasurer nor the Prime Minister has probably been to the supermarket anytime in the recent past. But the answer to that question really does not matter. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are very much out of touch. If they were in touch with the Australian people then they would not be proposing to introduce this massive new carbon tax. They would be saying, 'We acknowledge the fact that the cost of living is rising rapidly, the fact that people are struggling to pay their mortgage, the fact that utilities are going up virtually every day of the week.' Hardly a day goes by without another headline relating to the increased cost of living. You would think that a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who are in touch with the Australian people would say, 'We mustn't do anything that is going to make this situation worse.' Our policy focus must be that we endeavour to take the pressure off the cost of living to ensure that the government is not out there in the debt market competing with the private sector, driving up interest rates. We should be trying to do that from a policy perspective. But what is the situation? It is exactly the reverse. We are going to impose a carbon tax that is going to drive up the cost of living—drive up the cost of every single thing that you buy—and we are going to tell the Australian people that it is good for them, that we are going to save the planet. I certainly commend Senator Joyce for raising the question: how does imposing a new tax cool the planet? The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have always failed to answer that question, a very important question indeed.

It is going to drive up the cost of everything they buy. It will drive up the cost of memberships in sporting clubs. It is going to adversely impact on volunteer organisations that are also struggling to make ends meet through increased electricity bills for Meals on Wheels or whatever other voluntary organisation you care to name. It is interesting that the carbon tax is off budget. It is not included in the budget at this point in time. This is a major tax reform—or we will not even call it a reform; it is a major imposition of a new tax, and it was not included in this year's budget.

The government cannot increase NBN Co.'s budget because it will lower the internal rate of return for the project and therefore the IRR may ultimately fall below that hurdle rate which would require the project to be included on budget. The taxpayer component of capital expenditure for the NBN was originally $35.7 billion. We can legitimately ask whether the government lowered this amount to $27.5 billion simply because that is what it needed to produce a seven per cent IRR and keep the project off balance sheet so the government could claim a surplus next year. But without an understanding of the risks and an appropriate budget, this project is likely to blow out by billions of dollars. On Tuesday the

NBN Co. backed by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are changing all the rules and destroying all the competition in order to prop up the internal rate of return.

It produces a better outcome for consumers. It produces cheaper prices, yet with NBN Co., we are actually legislating for less competition. We are legislating to keep competition out of the market, which can only mean one thing: higher prices for consumers and a lessening in competition in the market.

This is a budget that does not pass the test of being responsible. It does not pass the test of a budget that is required to deliver quality outcomes for the Australian people. This is a budget that is certainly not going to result in a surplus in 2012-13 unless we see a little more creative accounting from the Treasurer.

I have got news for the Treasurer, because I do not know where he finds regional Australia but he did not find it in many part of Queensland, including my electorate. I am a representative of regional Australia. I am a representative of the seat of Maranoa and the voice of the people of Maranoa in this place, and Maranoa covers some 40 per cent of the land mass of Queensland. I fail to see how this budget will significantly benefit the people of regional Queensland. For instance, $500 million has been slashed from regional funding, and there is not a single new cent that has been introduced or announced for rail or road projects. We are talking about new money; not rebadged money but new money.

Of course they extend well beyond the boundaries of Maranoa, but they have not received a single cent of new funding in this budget. Sure, some money was announced for flood damage as a result of the natural disasters last year and this year, and I welcome that funding and I acknowledge it. But we need more than just repairs to the roads as result of the flood damage. We need new money to upgrade these very important major highways that link with the Murray-Darling Basin, western Queensland, the Surat Basin—that huge resource area where the roads are under enormous pressure from the trucks and the volume of traffic, which has escalated to a point I would not have imagined in my lifetime—and the strategic roads to the outback. We used to talk about the beef roads many years ago going out to the

All of those highways were cut, and that meant that normal traffic obviously could not move through but also that trucks with goods for those communities could not move through. Fuel comes in in tankers on a just-in-time basis. Food comes into the supermarkets and shops on a just-in-time basis. When I went into my local supermarket during the floods, I could not believe there was no food available. There were some non-essentials but there was no perishable food—milk and the basic essentials of everyday life. It was extraordinary. Why? Food, fresh vegetables, meat and all sorts of perishables come in by road just in time. These goods are being moved all the time on those highways, yet we were cut off from where the transport originates, which is mainly in the markets around Brisbane and the processing sector in the south-east corner. The trucks could not cross the range anywhere from north of Toowoomba and upper Kingaroy through to the border.

When I went to the fuel station, I found there was no fuel in town. Why? Once upon a time strategic reserves of fuel were held out in western Queensland at the fuel depots. Those days have long since gone and now fuel comes in almost daily to replenish the service stations. When the Toowoomba range and all the other roads I mentioned were cut, fuel and food could not be transported to our communities. We are so dependent on the road infrastructure and on this just-in-time basis for the delivery of so many essential items. We have to look at these highways and how we can ensure we are not cut off in the future from the delivery of essential items. The second range crossing is therefore critical in the longer term.

In the lead-up to the budget, I thought it sounded pretty good. Despite being home to almost a third of Australia's regional population, Queensland received just 12 per cent of the funding. Yet this was a budget for regional Australia. Payments have been massively skewed towards the Independents, who support this minority government. Tasmania, for instance, received some $80 million more than Queensland, despite having a fraction of the population. And this is meant to be a budget for regional Australia? The largest payment was a $240 million boost to the

There are 840 Medicare access points across regional, rural and remote Australia. I understand that they will be phased out over the next three years and that 33 of these Medicare booths will be removed from my electorate alone. These are points where people can go with their Medicare claim, put their claim into the booth—it may be a rural transaction centre where local farmers can use the Q-Gap facility—and, within three days, they will have their money in the bank. We are going to lose those services from my electorate and also 840 across Australia.

I am meeting with Medicare later and I will be very interested in that meeting. I think we have all experienced that frustration, sitting at the end of the telephone, being told: 'Your call is important to us; you have advanced in the queue, so please don't go away.' Then you listen to some beautiful music for another three or four minutes and the same message comes back again. I am very concerned that that is the sort of service we are going to get, which will replace across-the-counter or face-to-face service.

This is the first budget in eight years that has not seen a tax cut for families. Labor used to talk about 'working families'. Where are Labor's working families in this budget? We are going to see support for families cut at a time when they are facing tremendous cost-of-living pressures. Since this government came to power, electricity prices have risen by some 51 per cent. Grocery prices are up 14 per cent, and education and health costs are up by about 20 per cent and there have been seven interest rate rises in a row, increasing the average mortgage repayment by some $500 per month. The government is going to strip some $2 billion from families by freezing indexation on key family tax payments and income thresholds for the next three years. Families did not get a tax cut but corporate Australia did. That just defies logic. There is a tax cut for large companies, publicly listed companies, corporate Australia but not families.

Some $400 will be available to people on pensions and income support, to switch over from analog to digital. Anyone who has been to any electrical store lately will have seen that you can buy a set-top box for up to $40 or $50, not $400. In some cases, you can buy a digital television set for less than $400. Whilst this payment may be well intended, it will be yet another program administered by the government. It reminds me of those insulation batts that burn down houses. It also reminds me of the school halls program, following the global financial crisis, and here we are, in 2011. The Westmar State School had lost its school—it is a small community—because of a fire. I am absolutely frustrated. The P&amp;C are now being asked to put some of their own money into the so-called 'stimulus package' for their local hall. It is going to be a multipurpose hall without walls, apparently. It will have a roof but nothing else. The government is saying, 'We want you to put some of your money in to enclose it.' It is another example of the mismanagement of programs under this government. Not only can they not handle money; they have no idea of how to run a program.

Against the backdrop of the huge global food challenges we face over the next 50 years, we have to increase food production, according to the

From the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry we got a one-page press release, demonstrating the total lack of interest in agriculture and the important role regional Australia plays, feeding Australians with clean, green food every day. Farmers across Australia feed 60 million mouths every day with their production—not only Australians but a further 40 million outside Australia are dependent on the food we produce. Yet the government has ignored in this budget the agricultural sector.

If there is something which will hit every household and every business in Australia it is a carbon tax. Far from assisting, as is suggested in the carbon farming initiative—I spoke about this in the House last night—this carbon tax will drive costs up for our agricultural sector. It will put more pressure on the land and, if this does come to pass, farmers are going to have to produce not only what they have produced in the past but also they will have to pay the flow-on effect of a carbon tax in increased electricity prices and increases in transport costs. The only way farmers can deal with that is to put more stock on the land, putting more pressure on the land, and perhaps not having rotational crops in their arable lands, so that they will have to work the land harder. The net impact of a carbon tax will mean that in some cases farmers will be less competitive if not uncompetitive in the global market.

That is a little hard to equate with a $500 million cut from regional programs. Whatever the new delivery is, it is not in Calare.

Quite obviously, what Labor is offering Calare is a bigger deficit, more borrowings and higher debt. And the borrowings now? This is a great advancement! Over 12 months it has gone from $100 million a day to $135 million a day. I would guess the Treasurer can be very pleased with himself on that line.

There is not one cent of new money for roads and rail. It appears regional development will be contingent on the looming mining tax, a mining tax that would hurt one of the biggest industries in my part of the world that it relies on and the people who work in it rely on. In fact, the flow-through is right through the community. The mining sector has kept Calare's economy strong and it has kept Australia's economy strong. There is a large proportion of the electorate who are employed directly and indirectly by that sector. A tax which threatens these jobs also threatens the entire region. As I say, it flows right through, right down to coffee shops, dress shops, whatever. Take Orange, for example, with the expansion of Newcrest Cadia mines, coalmines such as Centennial Coal, Coalpac near Lithgow and North Parkes mine at the western end of the electorate. The mines invest enormous amounts into the communities. They involve themselves at the community level. They employ local people and keep our businesses thriving. Introduction of a mining tax has the ability to damage entire communities in our part of the world.

As we heard the member for Maranoa say, instead of ending months of uncertainty around the controversial tax, this government failed to include detail on how the tax will impact on our cost of living and jobs and cannot or will not answer questions in that regard in the House. Let me tell you that a carbon tax will without a doubt seriously hurt my region's business operations. A few weeks ago I had the good fortune to visit the Electrolux factory, which employs over 600 people in Orange. I had not visited it for a couple of years and the tour provided me with a classic example of how the carbon tax can affect not just the obvious industries but the retailing and the whitegoods industry as well. It produces a range of quality fridges and freezers, which are sold both domestically and internationally. Currently the main competition is Korean. Electrolux has worked out that even a very modest carbon tax will add about $10 to a fridge. Now, $10 may not seem much on an $800 fridge but it is not $10 on the cost of a fridge that is the issue. Currently they are running something like $70 or $80 over and above the cost of the Korean competition. This makes them $80 or $90 instead of $70 or $80 over the cost of the competition, which does make a huge difference. It is adding about 15 per cent more to the cost overrun they have across the competition. It is a better article and they are able to deal with that, but they are not able to deal with another 15 per cent differential in that cost. It is a huge issue, especially when it involves 602 jobs in Orange.

It certainly got a $500 cut in regional programs. Vital infrastructure, particularly roads and rail, are heavily relied upon in our neck of the woods. The inland rail link was mentioned briefly. However, there was no new money there. The only announcements about that were old hat, and there will be nothing in it for three years anyway. That is only for the paperwork and beginning of planning stages of the project in three years. The devil is really in the detail. All we have seen in the 2011 budget is a series of rehashed and revisited promises. The budget did not reveal anything we do not already know and it certainly did not deliver for Calare.

When I say water security I am not talking agriculture, I am talking urban; I am talking domestic and manufacturing water. Everyone west of the mountains knows the absolute importance of fixing up the access through the Blue Mountains. As far as water security is concerned, the long-term fix to ensure the central west does not again get into the position it was in a year or so ago is to have a new Lake Rowlands dam.

We all know that training country students is the best way to retain people to practise in our part of the world, and the dental school is a fine example of how to proceed in that direction.

We all know that we are bringing in many overseas doctors. Something like 50 per cent or more of doctors in rural Australia are overseas doctors, and the only way we are going to address that is to train our own. That has to be accepted; it has to be addressed. It is a huge disappointment.

That is ridiculous, especially when we know that the government is spending $50 billion to roll out optic fibre across the nation, much of which could be obsolete within a decade. That kind of money could fund so many things. It could fund so much infrastructure that would be there forever—road and rail through the Blue Mountains or inland. If you think about what $50 billion could fund, it is enormous. I worked out once that the last time Labor ran up a debt, which was $96 billion—and admittedly it took 14 years that time—it took the coalition 10 years to pay it back. This time they have run up around $110 billion in about 2½ years. The interest on the money last time was over $100 billion. How much infrastructure was in that? Infrastructure is needed in

Regional Australia is in desperate need of these workers, yet agriculture and horticulture have been specifically excluded from the raft of apprenticeships being funded. The farm sector drives over $150 billion a year in economic production and the industry supports 1.6 million Australian jobs, yet Labor has taken another swipe at agriculture, slashing nearly $33 million from its budget. The agriculture budget contains more missed opportunities than dollars. It was a nonevent, and the minister could have managed it from a beach in Bali. Coming into the budget, I suppose we should be thankful, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, that they did not put more time into it or he would have taken more money out of it.

I have seen them lately, and they are extraordinarily worried about the funding situation they are in. Our worst fears look increasingly likely as a result of this budget. The government continues to ignore glaring failures in proactively protecting Australia's shores from pests and diseases.

It ignored the fact that Queensland wanted to deal with the Asian honey bee. The minister and the department pretty much walked away from it. We now have myrtle rust not just hooking into nurseries; it is hooking into eucalyptus. Some four to five eucalypt species are now suffering, and it is up into Queensland. It could have been dealt with, but the bureaucrats and the ministry did not want to do so. This is a really serious issue. Biosecurity is a time bomb waiting to blow up. I implore the minister and the government to take it far more seriously.

Once again, that has been ignored. My electorate and the farmers of Australia have been left to pick up the pieces. And now we are going to have to pay back a net budget deficit of well over $100 billion once again.

I thought, 'Wow, this is a great opportunity for him to have a look at what is clearly one of the economically depressed regions of our country.' Forty-odd per cent of our economy relies on tourism, and we have had everything from floods and pestilence to cyclones—all the disasters you have seen in the media. Some people have decided, just on the basis of what they have seen in the news media, to cancel holidays they had booked to Cairns, even though the actual event might have occurred somewhere in the south-east corner of Queensland, which is probably closer to Melbourne than to Cairns. The impact on our businesses has been quite profound.

                                                                                                                                                      This is at the end of a couple of years of very, very difficult times in our region. We certainly got no benefit out of the stimulus package, given that governments were hell-bent on making sure that the primary contracts for any of the work that was done were provided to southern based contractors, leaving our own local builders and contractors to pick up the crumbs and putting them into very significant economic difficulties.
                                                                                                                                                     </p>

The Treasurer swanned into town, where he stayed in a five-star hotel on his fact-finding mission—and I do not suggest that people should not do that. Afterwards, he left. On budget night I listened to his speech and I really got excited. I thought there was going to be something for our city from this government. Right at the beginning of his speech, he acknowledged that we have a patchwork economy and that it is growing unevenly across the nation. We talk about 'patchwork', but in my region there are gaping black holes. The patches to fill in those holes have not even been manufactured yet!
                                                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                                                      The Treasurer talked about the natural disasters devastating families, cities and towns—and at the height of Yasi and at the start of the floods he could not have been more accurate. I thought this guy has seriously listened. Then he talked about the high dollar and, for the first and only time in his entire budget speech, he mentioned tourism, plus many manufacturing industries and especially small business—again, how true that is. In the last two years in my region, over 400 small businesses have folded and there are a hell of a lot more at the precipice; they are ready to go. He acknowledged that not every region prospers. He did not mention my region specifically but I thought that acknowledgement suggested that he was going to do something about it.
                                                                                                                                                     </p>

Again, I got excited because at the last election he had promised a headspace facility in Cairns. I thought, 'We're going to get that announcement today.' But I was very disappointed. As I sat there and listened to him go through his rhetoric—go through his speech—he never mentioned tourism again. He did say that Cyclone Yasi was going to cost the economy about $9 billion in lost output and reduced real

He was going to put 50,000 single parents back into the work queues. He was going to get the long-term unemployed and, of course, people with disabilities back to work. I thought to myself, 'This is not quite right'—and he is getting further into the speech. The problem we have up in Cairns is close to 14 per cent unemployment. So we are going to get these guys back into a job; but they are not long-termers. These people lost their jobs last week or the week before. So what is the point of training long-term unemployed people for jobs that do not exist? So I thought maybe we were being sold a bit of pup here.

Four years ago the government announced $150 million for an overpass on Ray Jones Drive. They had announced it three times over the four years prior to that announcement by Minister Albanese when he was up our way recently. He also confirmed the government's commitment to the region by announcing that a southern based contractor would be doing the work. He made that announcement about a week before the last standing civil constructer, who had employed up to 600 people in Cairns, went into liquidation. They had not even been considered.
                                                                                                                                                     </p>

We have had meeting after meeting to try to get our local builders and suppliers involved in the rebuild after Yasi. It is almost impossible to get the government to listen to us. Most of the contracts continue to go to their mates in the southern part of the state, leaving only the subcontractors in our areas to pick up the bits and pieces, which are really not quite enough to keep them alive. We had unemployment of close to 14 per cent. It has dropped recently, but the reason it has dropped recently is because people are leaving town. That is the main reason. People are leaving town or going into part-time employment because full-time employment is not there. So I am pleading with the Treasurer: for goodness sake, whatever you do, do not start training the long-term unemployed or those with disabilities or the single mums. Give the people who lost their jobs today and yesterday an opportunity to get their job first.

On my side of politics we had committed to build a wellbeing centre for this organisation—not a cent out of this government to support that, and I think that is very, very disappointing when you stop and think about the amount of money and commitment that has been put in by the community to establish this themselves. Yet this government can go down to an Independent and give $31 million to his electorate. We were only looking for $12 million. The members for

It is not capable of withstanding storm surges or cyclones so they evacuate the whole hospital and the community is without a hospital. They gave $12 million. I see there is $120 million for the Tamworth Hospital, plus another $20 million for funding for new medical training facilities.

I go through the election commitments. As I said, there is the $150 million for stage 1 of the Bruce Highway—nothing has happened; $40 million for performing arts—not a cracker has been spent. They got a coordinator in for fly in, fly out jobs for Cairns, but there have been absolutely no direct results from that at this point in time. You have got Cazalys—they are still spending the money, $3 million, on that, and there was another one for remote housing, $4.5 million, which is still to be delivered, and the list goes on There was $9.37 million for the Daintree Rainforest Observatory—it still has not been done. There was a commitment to Headspace, but it still has not been done. There was $3.5 million for development of the rugby league, which still has not been delivered—not a cracker. You have to ask yourself: when are they going to start being serious?

He needs to match his rhetoric with action. Cairns in the far northern region is in desperate need of support. We have people up there who, from 30 June, will be paying an increased Medicare levy, who are expected to support people in the area affected by Cyclone Yasi. Nobody in my region and north of my region can access any support. They cannot access any of the loans or any of the grants because it is just impossible for them to do so. First of all, their buildings may not have been blown away but their businesses certainly were. But because they might have had a dollar in their credit card or they had some level of insurance or they had gone out and got a second job to feed their families, they were automatically disqualified. It is an absolute disgrace that these people continue to desperately need this help and there is nothing available for them.

He was known for his great sense of humour and pride in his community. He was a quiet achiever and everything he did was for others, not for his own political gain. Even in retirement, Greg was well informed about the local community and was often keen to bend my ear about the future of my electorate.

Greg was ahead of his time when it came to his vision for Macarthur. The significant contributions he made to the city of Campbelltown are something that not only his family but the entire community can certainly be proud of. I believe it would have been appropriate to honour Greg Percival with a state funeral, recognising his status amongst the Macarthur community. I hope all those who choose a life in the political arena, whether at a local, state or federal level, make the same contribution to their communities and are held in the same high esteem as this great man.

On behalf of the Macarthur community, I would like to publicly acknowledge Greg for the great contribution he made to our community and thank him for his vision which has helped make my electorate what it is today. Greg, this is the only battle I remember you losing. You will always be loved and respected. You will always be remembered. Rest in peace, my good friend.

The reason everyone got together was to launch the third round of successful companies to receive money through the SA Innovation and Investment Fund, set up by both the state and the federal government in response to the collapse and the closure of Mitsubishi in 2008.

However, as result of this fund, through the proactive investment by the federal and state governments, we have seen a blossoming of manufacturing businesses in my local area. The money from the SA Innovation and Investment Fund has helped to allow these innovative manufacturing businesses to expand. Three manufacturing businesses in my local community are set in this round to benefit from close to $2½ million. The important funds will provide local industry with a much-needed boost to commit an expansion with a particular focus in this round of projects on the renewable energy sector's manufacturing and engineering to create jobs in the local area. Lonsdale-based manufacturing companies Redarc Electronics, Robin Johnson Engineering and SMR Automotive Australia will be able to use their funding to expand and diversify, creating new jobs for locals in southern Adelaide. Talking to these businesses, you hear about some of the really innovative local manufacturing cutting-edge technology that they are not only taking up but developing, putting southern Adelaide at the forefront of advanced manufacturing. This is the future for manufacturing in Australia. We often hear that manufacturing is not expanding but I do believe that manufacturing has a bright future in this country and that it is companies such as these that will take manufacturing to the next level with innovative cutting-edge technology.

This company develops, produces and distributes exterior mirrors, blind spot detection systems and a wide range of automotive components. The company has 22 per cent of the global market share in production of exterior mirrors for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and heavy trucks. It is one of the leading experts for camera based sensing systems in the automotive industry. One of the particular products it has developed—I do not want to give any intellectual property away but, as they said at the launch, it is very difficult just from the description to be able to actually replicate this. They have been able to manufacture very high quality plastic exterior mirrors for cars, and they are the first to do it in the world at this quality and standard. This reduces the weight of the car. Every component in a car adds to the burden that the user has on fuel, so there is a real focus on moving away from heavy vehicles to lighter ones. This innovative idea will reduce the total weight of the car. SMR did not develop this on their own; they have excellent strategic partnerships with a number of research institutions such as the

The coalition has been fighting tooth and nail to reverse a disgraceful decision by the then Minister for Education and now Prime Minister to cut assistance for rural students under the Independent Youth Allowance Scheme. Regrettably, I was on leave from the House at the beginning of this year, which prevented me from speaking on the importance of the work done by the Liberal led coalition members and senators in the coalition, particularly the member for Forrest, in trying to talk this government back into common sense and decency on this issue.

As a rural member of parliament at both state and federal level for the past 23 years, I am totally dismayed by the government's disgraceful attempts to advise the Governor-General to scrap the bill proposed by the Abbott led coalition. The government is trying to block the coalition's moves at every turn to get back the funding rural students desperately need. Students who cannot access youth allowance in the inner regions are going to be the big losers if the government persists with these appalling tactics. At the beginning of this year I gathered 500 signatures of hardworking families and students from across the Hume electorate in support of the coalition's petition to reinstate the financial support rural students desperately need to help them get through their tertiary education. During the period that I was running the petition and gathering signatures I was being told stories such as the one from a family in Goulburn whose son was adversely affected by the changes introduced in July last year:

He has earned more than $13,010 in the financial year so we cannot claim him to be dependent on us. He will turn 20 years old in May and feels he should not have to wait any longer to commence his course of study. We agree with this.

Students and families planned their tertiary education, deferment, financial savings and choice of university all in good faith, reliant on the government's criteria prior to the 1 July 2010 changes. The government scrapped the criteria during the very period that students and families were halfway through their attempt to meet the work and earning-capacity criteria.
                                                                                                                                                          </p>

As I have said for a long time: do not look at what Labor says; look at what they do. Because of this government ineptitude, we now run the risk of having regional students turn away from continuing their student careers at university. This would be a tragedy not only for rural and regional Australia but for all Australians.

It has been a very busy six weeks for these schools. The construction work for many of them was to be completed over Christmas, but some of those works were delayed because of the heavy rains and floods in Queensland. Others have spent the first term basically settling into their new facilities: putting the books into the new library, setting up the resource centre, putting in the finishes to the hall and landscaping around it. It is great that so many schools have now got these facilities up and operational.

It is incredible. Every classroom is new; there is a new tuckshop, a new library, new computer facilities and a new playground. It is just incredible and it is great to see what has been done. They chose to do the opening as part of their open day to showcase their school to the broader community. It was also their 40th anniversary, and Grace pioneers—people who were instrumental in starting the school 40 years ago—came back for the opening.

We know that the hall is used by a lot of community groups, and this will allow those groups to use the hall for many more purposes. They have a completely refurbished library and new resource centre with an outdoor learning area. It is incredible to see the space they have now. But what is so important for the school is that they have a dedicated area for their computers as well.

We forget that, because of the creation of a new building, everything expands and there are whole new places that they can use in the school.

Deception Bay Flexible Learning Centre is doing amazing things with those of our kids who have been disengaged from the main school system. A lot of them are young parents, and they have a parenting program going in. They have a great creche inside the flexible learning centre where the parents can leave their babies, and they can go and get their education. The work that this school is doing is incredible.

What is great about this is that this high school is partnering with primary schools, and primary school kids are coming in and learning Japanese in this new language centre, which includes a kitchen where they are preparing Japanese food and everything else. The work that has been done here is just incredible.

Builders, architects and project managers have done a fantastic job on these projects. They deserve to be acknowledged and thanked for their great work. Every school is thrilled with these facilities.

Of course, that brings with it extraordinary challenges with having to catch water taxis and vehicle barges, sometimes more than once a day. Particularly in the context of non-subsidised transport for those who do not have concession cards, it represents a significant added burden on the cost of living for those residents. So obviously this engages the mind of everyone who represents that part of the world, at all three levels of government. It obviously throws our minds back to the 1970s, when these islands were, with very little research and thinking, subdivided without any undertaking for infrastructure charges to be extracted from those who developed and sold off the land. Today we are reaping the consequences of those short-sighted decisions of the 1970s. So, without casting any blame, there is a need for a solution, and most would understand that the revenue model of local government is such that those sorts of challenges simply cannot be overcome by being passed to council alone; it will require state and federal government to work together.

People say that, if you move to an island, you choose to take on a certain level of isolation and, with it, fewer services. But there comes a point where Australian citizens should be able to say, 'I can reasonably access a doctor; I can reasonably access food and essentials on that island without either undue risks or enormous expense to obtain them.' Seniors, predominantly, who find themselves on the island and young families who find that there are not adequate facilities for their children are completely right to be asking for solutions to those challenges. Right now the key problem is parking. Anyone on those islands will tell you that the plans being considered by

This is a fantastic example of people power. This small island community—in many cases, out of sight, out of mind—of South-East Queensland residents were able to effectively stake out the council until it committed to doing the transport studies that the 'Our Parking Spot' group called for and to providing the car parks. Council cannot do it alone—I emphasise that. But it is so important for council to not just pay lip-service and just talk about consultation but engage.

The islands are jewels in Moreton Bay. We have a chance to optimise so many things about services to those islands. It will take a little forethought and some future planning, but for now it is the Redland City Council that must rise to the challenge. Six thousand signatures from locals, most of them mainlanders, have said, 'Though we do not live on the islands we can understand the needs.' We know it is an ageing population. We know there are small kids who must finish school and transition to a trade and a career. We know from St Vincent de Paul studies that this area faces significant socioeconomic challenges. As the federal member, I will not lose sight of that. We will work. We know there is no easy and simple solutions. I sympathise with the council in that regard.

I put my support fully behind the residents of the islands who are asking for nothing more than an affordable solution. If that ultimately means incorporating travel on the bay into South-East Queensland's TransLink arrangements so that travelling on water is simply another zone of public transport then that will be a very important advance.

The pace of development has been incredible. Paddocks have been transformed into housing estates in what it feels like the blink of an eye. While bricks and mortar have spread rapidly in Western Sydney, residents in my neck of the woods also recognise the value of maintaining green space within the built space. Reflecting this, state governments and councils, to their credit, have been keen to establish more parkland out our way, and the Western Sydney parkland stands as a terrific example of this. But we need people to help maintain and protect these green spaces.

Most of them were early school leavers, who used the opportunity provided by the program to acquire skills and pursue options they never thought they would have. The National Green Jobs Corps is a 26-week training and work experience program, delivering 10,000 places over two years for eligible Australians aged from 17 to 24 and costing around $80 million. Participants undertake work experience and skills development on environmental projects, with 130 hours of this training leading to a nationally recognised qualification in horticulture or conservation and land management, helping them get ready for deployment in emerging green and climate change industries. The projects are focused on conservation, protection and rejuvenation of natural environment and cultural heritage.

He said: 'The reason I wanted to go into the program was simple. I was at a job provider's premises. I saw a brochure that was green. I turned it over.

I want to take the opportunity to congratulate them, to remark on the impression they left on me and to celebrate their achievements. They deserve recognition for their hard work and their contributions to their local community. The environmental restoration and regeneration works they undertook will serve as a long-lasting testament to their community and their personal success.

(ii) Under the proposed USO Agreement, Telstra will receive payments from USO Co that will go towards meeting the net costs of meeting the USO.
