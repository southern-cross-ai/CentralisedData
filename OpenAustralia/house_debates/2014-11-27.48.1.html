        Whilst the eyes of the golfing world are on the Australian Golf Club today, and many may think that kicks offer Sydney' golfing season, I am here to tell you that they are wrong. Two weeks ago, on Sunday, 9 November, Barnwell Park Golf Club in the electorate of Reid held their Pro-Am—the first one they have held in 20 years. It was put together by a great group of locals. The major sponsor was Jason Meares from Centenary Advisory Group, the local professional Greg Engall, and the amazing new restaurant at the club house, Novus, was integral to it. All the local businesses came together to sponsor it, hole by hole. The Australian

        —excellent work, guys. This was all brought together under the amazing tutelage of Craig Delaney—a great golfer himself. I had the pleasure of growing up with him in the area and playing a lot of golf with him. If only they were the days.

        To the board, the players and the volunteers, I congratulate on what you have done. I know you mentioned on the day that you are doing it next year. I was unable to join you this year, due to prior commitments. I joined you for the presentation, which was great, where I awarded the prize to long-term local and my good mate
