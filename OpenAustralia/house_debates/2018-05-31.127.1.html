        Roger Bailie Nicholson was a remarkable Australian. Roger, who sadly passed away this month, made a vast contribution to our community. Roger enjoyed a successful career, with roles including government relations manager at Shell and executive director of the Australian Institute of Petroleum. His voluntary activities were many and varied. He was heavily involved with the

        , Melbourne Rotary Club and Melbourne Probus Club.
       </p>

        Perhaps the most defining aspect of Roger's legacy is the significant role he played in establishing Very Special Kids, or VSK. VSK is an extraordinary charity based in Higgins, first established in 1985. VSK became the first support organisation in Victoria designed to offer assistance to families of children with life-threatening conditions. Roger negotiated premises, obtained and organised finance and supervised the building program. In recognition of the crucial role he played, VSK made Roger a life governor. Roger's achievement was honoured in 2007 when he received an Order of Australia for service to the community, particularly through support for youth organisations, including Very Special Kids.

        More than 200 people packed St George's Anglican Church to say goodbye, demonstrating just how much our community respected Roger. Our thoughts are with his wife, Fay; children, Robert, Diana and Fiona; and his remarkable grandchildren, Sarah, Emma, Lucy, Harry, William, Laura and Allison.
       </p>

        It was fitting, then, that on the day after Roger's funeral VSK hosted its annual 24-hour treadmill challenge fundraiser. The support shown by our community was incredible, with the event beating its target, raising an impressive $910,000. I congratulate the VSK team, including its incredible patron and founder, Sister Margaret Noone;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Michael Wasley; chairman, Peter Polson; and the fantastic staff and volunteers, as well as the wider community, for this phenomenal effort. It costs more than $7.5 million per year to operate and run VSK, so every single dollar counts. VSK helps more than 950 families across Victoria. I was delighted that the federal government could play a small part in securing their future with the purchase of their grounds in Malvern with a federal grant of $4 million. VSK no longer has to pay rent, meaning it can instead focus its funds towards delivering more support. When we first announced federal funding we said that VSK does the work of angels. Those words are so true, and they hold true today. Long may its important work continue in delivering support, advice and help to families that most need it.
