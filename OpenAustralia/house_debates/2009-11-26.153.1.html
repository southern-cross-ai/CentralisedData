        Mr Speaker, I have the honour to inform you and the House that a little while ago I was elected leader of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party and therefore as Leader of the Opposition. I inform you, Mr Speaker, that until further notice front bench arrangements otherwise remain the same.

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence: on behalf of the government, I offer my congratulations to Tony on his election as Leader of the Opposition. Obviously, I know Tony well; we spent a lot of time chasing each other around as Minister for

          I put that badly! We were politically arguing questions of health and questions of procedure in this House. We were for a while a

          show for Australian politics and from time to time, when we were in that phase of our political careers, I did remark that it was my aspiration to see Tony as Leader of the Opposition, so there we have it. It would be my aspiration for Tony to remain in that job for a very long, long time. I wish him luck in that: long service as Leader of the Opposition. To my counterpart, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: we spent the end of last year in what I thought were very good-natured Catwoman jokes. I think she has one attribute—nine lives—which is coming in very handy indeed for her. My congratulations to her.
         </p>
         <p>
          I say to the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, that politics is a fascinating business, it is an uplifting business and it is also from time to time a very bruising business. Unfortunately, part of the required art form is to not show when you have taken some bruises. I think Mr Turnbull in his conduct in the past few days has shown himself to be a man of great honour. He is a man who is conducting himself in a very gracious and dignified way now. We wish for him some moments of quiet repose and some good and happy days with his family over the forthcoming Christmas period.

          <p>
           On indulgence, if I may, Mr Speaker: I thank Julia, the Deputy Prime Minister, for those gracious remarks. It is true: we have been sparring partners in quite a few different contexts. I have even been accused from time to time of flirting with the Deputy Prime Minister. That must cease now, of course. I have always enjoyed those contests and I have to say that the Deputy Prime Minister is a formidable opponent. She has wished me a long and not very happy life in my current job. I can say that I hope she does ascend. I would like her to be the Prime Minister because I am sure question time would be much more interesting and much shorter if she were the Prime Minister.
          </p>
          <p>
           I should also respond on behalf of the former leader, the member for Wentworth, to the Deputy Prime Minister’s particularly gracious remarks. We who have been in this place know that while politics is a high and noble form of public service it is probably the most unforgiving business of all. Everyone comes into this place with high ideals and high hopes. The hopes are sometimes dashed—not always permanently but often for a time—and I think it important that all of us bleed a little for our colleagues in this great pursuit when that happens. I think all of us should take a moment to reflect on what has happened to Malcolm and I think, as you say, Julia, we should all wish him well at this time.
