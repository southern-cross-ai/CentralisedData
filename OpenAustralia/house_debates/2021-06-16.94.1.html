        My question is again to the

        . When strawberries and public health were under threat, this government pushed through urgent legislation in a single day. Why isn't the government treating the mouse plague, which is threatening farms across four states, with any sense of urgency?

         I thank the member for her question. I think it's important to understand that that was a malicious criminal act. This is a natural occurrence, one that's been happening since the

          I'm sorry, but the fact remains that the Australian government has provided farm household allowance to those farmers who are in financial distress. That is the equivalent of JobSeeker. That gives them the JobSeeker rate. It gives them the opportunity to put bread and butter on the table and to take away the stress. The federal government has made that available. In addition, as part of our efforts to support the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          government in their responsibility in tackling this, the APVMA have approved six emergency permit uses of chemicals. We are currently assessing a further one, as we speak at the moment, to support the New South Wales efforts in this.
         </p>
         <p>
          I heard the interjections in the question about
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Marshall" rel="nofollow">
           Adam Marshall
          </a>
          , the New South Wales minister for agriculture. Only yesterday, we had a ministerial council meeting of agriculture ministers and Mr Marshall did not turn up. And no other minister even raised the mouse plague, because there is an understanding that this is their responsibility. They are sovereign governments with the responsibility, and the resources, to deal with it. But we will support them with things like farm household allowance, the APVMA and the science of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
           CSIRO
          </a>
          to make sure we can address this.
         </p>
         <p>
          There will be more mouse plagues. There will be locust plagues. Since Federation, our states have done the job, and the New South Wales government has stood up and done the job. We should congratulate the New South Wales government for getting on with their responsibility—not passing the buck but doing the job of investing $150 million in solving the problem, partnering with the Commonwealth in the science but also in us giving dignity and respect to our farmers in their hour of need.
