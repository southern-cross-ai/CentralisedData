       <p>
        As a result of strong economic management, this government has been able to deliver real and practical benefits to our local communities. Maintaining safe roads is an important priority and, since its introduction in 1996, the black spot road funding program has been able to invest over $400 million across Australia to make our roads safer. Lives have been saved and accidents on Australian roads have been reduced. By investing in practical measures such as traffic signals and roundabouts at dangerous locations on our roads, the program reduces the risk of crashes. Ensuring the safety of both motorists and residents is a key priority for me and, through the black spot road funding program, this government has already fixed 11 dangerous black spots in the electorate of Bonner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I was able to announce over $430,000 in funding to fix a further three black spots in the bayside of Bonner. Many bayside residents would be familiar with the Tingal Road, Ronald Street and Florence Street intersection at Wynnum, which in the past five years has caused one fatal and six casualty crashes. Property has also been damaged on several occasions as a result of ongoing accidents, and I am well aware of community concern for the safety of schoolchildren, in particular, who cross the intersection every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the black spot road funding program, I have been able to announce that $200,000 will be dedicated to the upgrade of this dangerous intersection so that the necessary safety improvements can be made. One hundred and sixty thousand dollars will also be spent to fix the intersection of Pine Street and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Terrace" rel="nofollow">
         Bay Terrace
        </a>
        in Wynnum, which in recent years has seen one fatal and three casualty crashes. The funding will be used to install traffic islands and line markings and to improve lighting for those driving or walking at night.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also pleased to announce that $70,000 will be spent on a black spot in Manly where one fatal and two casualty crashes have occurred. For too long the intersection of Manly and Stannard roads in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly_West" rel="nofollow">
         Manly West
        </a>
        has been a major concern and frustration for many local residents and motorists. The black spot road project will upgrade the intersection by improving sight lines, reinforcing priority signs, installing traffic islands and providing a painted turn line.
       </p>
       <p>
        These upgrades seem simple; however, they have been developed as a result of community consultation and are practical measures that will help to eliminate the risk of any further serious crashes. I will be working with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        over the coming months to ensure that the improvements are carried out as soon as possible. As I talk with residents and members of the community, it is increasingly evident that infrastructure is a major issue of concern. Motorists and pedestrians are entitled to safe local roads, and they should not simply have to settle for second best.
