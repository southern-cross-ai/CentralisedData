       <p>
        Today we celebrate the achievements of yet another wonderful woman of Goldstein—Hampton's own, Emma Olivier. Emma is the first woman with one arm to pass the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Bronze Medal
        </a>
        and serve as a lifesaver during Black Rock Life Saving Club's summer patrol. I met Emma last year on my visit to the club. In particular, I saw their need to redevelop their facilities as part of this important community institution. At the time, Emma was preparing for the Bronze Medal test. Since then, the 46-year-old has trained in running and swimming throughout the week, learnt
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPR" rel="nofollow">
         CPR
        </a>
        , learnt how to use a defibrillator, learnt how to treat injuries and even learnt how to use a trusty radio as a communication tool.
       </p>
       <p>
        Emma has demonstrated that the challenges life has presented to her do not act as a barrier to her achievement. She wanted to prove to herself that she could do this but she also did it to set an example to others. In a recent newspaper article she was quoted as saying: 'There might be a kid out there who is like me who goes, "Well, actually I never thought that I could do this, and maybe I can."' Emma understands that, for so many young people, 'you cannot be what you cannot see'. But, even with that saying, there is always someone out there who has to be a trailblazer—and that is you, Emma. On behalf of the entire parliament I would like to say how proud of her we are.
