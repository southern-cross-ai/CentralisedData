        I would like to share a truly exceptional lifetime achievement by two people in my electorate. Any wedding anniversary is worth celebrating, but Colin and Daphne Holdsworth of

        have a love for the ages.

        , they celebrated a special diamond anniversary, 75 years of marriage, a milestone that not many people are lucky enough to reach. Colin is 94 and Daphne is 96. I am told they are as happy today as they were when they tied the knot. They have created quite a legacy with 10 children and more than 80 descendants and, with that, many loving family members. I have no doubt they have received a mountain of congratulations on this special day.

        Colin and Daphne were thrilled to receive a letter from the Queen and their elected representatives congratulating them on this occasion. They celebrated their anniversary by supporting a great local institution, heading to the Goodna Services Club for a romantic lunch. At a time when it seems there is a lot of bad news to talk about, Colin and Daphne's story is a shining example of the significant impact that love can have. Their story has brought a lot of happiness to our local community, and I would like to congratulate them on their enduring relationship. Mrs and Mrs Holdsworth: I wish you all the very best for the years to come.
