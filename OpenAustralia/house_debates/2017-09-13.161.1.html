       <p>
        I rise today to mention to the House the sad passing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Rod Wilson
        </a>
        of Calliope Station, Calliope. I noticed your presence, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, at Rod's funeral. He was very well known across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        and indeed Queensland. Rod was not the sort of man well captured by a 90-second speech, but one who would want less fuss. Rod was an engineer and inventor, not by paper but by action—a generational grazier with everlasting passions for his land, his family and his country. His passion for technology is legendary, always looking for a better, easier and more scientific method for living life and to make life and work better for others around him—particularly his own staff. Rod's political nous and knowledge was unbeatable and led to a very successful career as the undefeated campaign director for former member for Hinkler Paul Neville. He kept in touch with people from all over and knew exactly what they wanted. Life membership to the Nationals was fittingly bestowed on Rod just before the merger of the National Party and the Liberal Party in 2008. Rod is survived by his loving wife, Sylvia; their children, Zoe, Eliza and Will; and their grandchildren. Rod, you are always in our thoughts. Rest in peace.
       </p>

        Secondly, I'd like to announce that Flynn will benefit sooner rather than later, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        provider announcements this week. Carers Queensland and BUSHkids will share in $23 million funding: BUSHkids $6.2 million; Carers Queensland $17.2 million. These two organisations will partner with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        . Carers Queensland have already advertised in Gladstone, Emerald and Rocky for local staff. This will deliver many new jobs for Flynn. Access to the NDIS has been brought forward for those already on a disability scheme. These vital programs will having lasting benefits for families and carers in my region of Flynn.
