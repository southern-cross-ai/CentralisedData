       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate all the award winners of the inaugural Hallett Cove Business Association Local Business Awards. In my electorate of Kingston, there are many small businesses that are the backbone of economic growth and employment in our community. Our region is home to many longstanding businesses—shops, stores and services—that have been around for decades and have turned into important local institutions. I'm excited when I see many new small businesses open up in our region. I've met many business owners who've taken that leap of faith to pursue a passion or an idea and open a small business in the southern suburbs of Adelaide.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're very fortunate in the southern suburbs to have a number of business associations that support our small businesses. Running a small business can be challenging. Business associations are really important to exchange ideas, support small businesses, provide advice and, importantly, advocate on their behalf. One such business association is the Hallett Cove Business Association, which is chaired by Marie and also has a very dedicated committee who work incredibly hard to ensure that small businesses in the area connect and are supported. That is why it was wonderful that one of their initiatives has been to have these important awards. They wanted to recognise some of the outstanding small businesses in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very privileged to attend the awards night and would like to take the opportunity to formally congratulate the winners. Firstly, Business of the Year, won by the Hallett Cove Bakery. Owners Shaun and Sandra—and their daughter, Bek—started this award-winning bakery after moving from England only nine years ago. It's no surprise they also won the hospitality category. Andrew and Victoria from Brighton Pianos won the retail category. Their service and store has been operating in Adelaide for 35 years now. Mick and the team at Midcoast Tyres and Mechanical Sheidow Park won the trades category—congratulations. Kirsty from SwiftClean won the 'professional under 5' category. Kirsty only recently started SwiftClean and she prides herself on the team's attention to detail. Glenn and the team at Harcourts Plus won the 'professional over 5' category award. Natalie from Abode of Beauty won 'outstanding customer service'. Natalie has over 22 years of experience in the beauty industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to all the winners of those awards. There were many, many nominees. Just so you know, there were about 80 nominations for these awards, which shows a real vibrancy and sense of healthy competition in the local area. Congratulations to all the nominees but, especially, to the award winners.
