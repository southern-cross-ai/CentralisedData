        I rise to share that the inaugural Holt Family Fun Day in the scenic coastal village of Warneet in my electorate of Holt was a grand success. It was a vibrant event filled with smiles, laughter and an overdose of cuteness as parents and their children gathered to celebrate the shared spirit of family, unity and mateship that defines the community I am so proud to represent.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the outset I acknowledge the organisations, volunteers and community members who helped transform this idea into a grand success. Their relentless dedication, spirit of service and constant commitment to our community are the pillars upon which such events stand. This event was organised in collaboration with Backpacks 4
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Kids, a local charity that provides essential material aid to displaced children who often have little more than the clothes they are wearing at the time of their displacement. Backpacks 4 VIC Kids were generous to donate goodie bags for parents, which consisted of baby-friendly items for the youngest members of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main attraction for children at the family fun day, however, was the fire truck displayed in the car park thanks to Warneet-Blind Bight

        , the local volunteer fire brigade. They were kind enough to let children use the fire hose on the truck and speak to parents and children alike about the importance of fire safety. I would also like to thank the Warneet Motor Yacht Club who offered their public hall free of charge in the spirit of ensuring the best for our community. During the event, many parents emphasised their happiness with the hard work undertaken by the Albanese Labor government, particularly with this government's suit of family-friendly policies. Through initiatives like cheaper child care and changes to paid parental leave, families in my electorate will be able to spend more time and money on their little ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who participated in the Holt Family Fun Day, contributing to making it a memorable day filled with joy and community spirit. I am immensely proud to represent such a vibrant and connected community, and I look forward to continuing the collaboration with Backpacks 4 VIC Kids for the rest of the Holt Family Fun Days we have planned for various parts of my electorate. I would like to thank the House.
