       <p>
        I would like to raise a local issue which is very important to my electorate of Kingston and about which people have a lot of concern, and that is future of the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil" rel="nofollow">
         ExxonMobil
        </a>
        refinery site at Port Stanvac. ExxonMobil is exiting this site and has indicated that, as part of this process, they may demolish the jetty unless another party takes responsibility for its ongoing maintenance. I believe that this would be a very disappointing optionâ€”to lose a jetty which is an iconic piece of infrastructure in the southern Adelaide region.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an opportunity for the local community. The exit of ExxonMobil means that there is an opportunity for locals to be able to enjoy and benefit from this previously inaccessible beach. This beach is pristine and beautiful and up until now residents in the local area have not been able to access it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I did a petition on this and received an overwhelming response from over 650 householders in the O'Sullivan's Beach and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallett_Cove" rel="nofollow">
         Hallett Cove
        </a>
        area, indicating their support for public access to the beach and for being able to use the jetty. Many comments were made, including this one from Tania Verrall who said, 'The jetty and beach could become a real tourist attraction.' I call on the state and local governments to work together to ensure that we act upon the views of over 650 households so that we can access this beach, enjoy this beach, use the jetty, and actually have a public space that we can all celebrate.
