        My question is to the Minister for Human Services. I refer to the minister's trip to China in August 2014 and the statement from the minister's office in

       <p>
        On his outgoing Australian passenger card and on his official Chinese visa application form what did the minister declare the purpose of his trip was? Did the minister's declaration reflect that he was travelling in a private capacity?

        <p>
         Yesterday, when I gave a long and extensive ruling on this and referred to page 555 of
         <i>
          Practice
         </i>
         , I did quote that section that included:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A Minister may not be asked a question about his … former ministerial role.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then I quoted the section:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         However, in a case when a Minister had issued a statement referring to earlier responsibilities …
        </p>
        <p>
         I said that was in 2006. Indeed, it was on 9 February 2006, and it was a question from the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, to Mr Truss, the now Deputy Prime Minister, and indeed it did refer to a statement from the minister's office. So, in that sense, the member for Isaacs has followed that precedent that I identified. What I am going to rule though is that the question and the answer were very tight; it went to the statement itself. I am going to allow the member for Isaacs to rephrase the question, because, whilst the
         <i>
          Practice
         </i>
         is obviously very limited in this area, I do not believe it is within the intent of the
         <i>
          Practice
         </i>
         back then to allow a questioner to simply refer to a statement that has been made and then raise a different issue. So I am going to allow the member for Isaacs to rephrase the question.

           Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That question is exactly the same as the question he asked before.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
            If I
           </a>
           understand your ruling correctly, the member can ask about the actual statement that was made by the minister's office, but he cannot then, therefore, ask about a new subject—the Chinese visa application or the outgoing passenger card. There is no reference to the outgoing passenger card or the Chinese visa in the minister's office's statement to the media.

           </small>
           <p>
            Mr Speaker, on the point of order, the only question that is being asked with respect to those two documents is whether or not they reflect the statement that is being made by the minister's office. The only thing we are asking about those cards is whether or not they reflect the statement that he was travelling in a private capacity. I appreciate that if it asked about anything else on those cards it would be beyond your ruling, but it is only asking whether it was a private capacity.

            <p>
             I have listened very carefully and, obviously, as members saw yesterday, I have considered the matter extensively. I have examined the
             <i>
              Hansard
             </i>
             from that day back in 2006 that I think is a useful guide. There is a narrow opportunity to ask questions on the statement itself. Really, the
             <i>
              Hansard
             </i>
             from back then reflects that. So, on this occasion, I think that is beyond the intent still. I will give the member for Isaacs one more chance to tightly rephrase it, otherwise we will move to the next question.
