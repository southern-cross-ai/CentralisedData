        I would like to pay credit to the wonderful, dedicated group of people in Belmont
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" rel="nofollow">
         Neighbourhood Watch
        </a>
        who are led by Deadre Ham,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , a dedicated person, who has served her community for many years, just as Belmont Neighbourhood Watch serves our community. They deliver the Neighbourhood Watch newspaper come rain, hail or shine. They also provide all the residents of the Belmont area with information on safety and keep them up-to-date on crime statistics. There are many good contact numbers available in that wonderful Neighbourhood Watch newspaper. Deadre and her dedicated volunteers have been delivering the newsletter for well in excess of 20 years. A number of members of that group have been awarded Shortland awards in recognition of the fine service they have given to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as that, many of those reliable, tireless members of Neighbourhood Watch have also received recognitionâ€”under the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program and other volunteer programs. I would like to say thank you very much to Deadre Ham and her group of tireless workers as they continue to distribute Neighbourhood Watch newsletters throughout the Belmont area.
