       <p>
        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and relates to the future of the Australian wheat industry. Deputy Prime Minister, further to your commitment to a Victorian wheat rally earlier this year of a poll of all growers if changes were proposed to wheat export arrangements, and given your statements earlier today that ‘Wheat growers are the people that matter,’ and ‘A full consultative process with industry will take place, importantly with growers,’ will you guarantee that a properly constituted poll of all registered wheat growers be undertaken on the various options being considered in relation to the single desk before any cabinet decisions are taken?

         I thank the member for his question. As the government has clearly indicated from the outset on this very important issues, as far as wheat growers are concerned, we are going to consult widely with the industry. We have the tried and true mechanisms for seeking the views of growers both directly and indirectly through their peak body organisations, many of whom have been working with the government over a period of time during the course of this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can assure the member, all members of the House and particularly the wheat growers of Australia that the government is not going to take any decisions in terms of locking in future arrangements until we have drawn in the views of all players in the industry. I did say at the press conference that the views of growers are the most important thing, because it is the wheat growers of Australia whose product we are talking about and not the entities that manage it or market it; it is the growers and their families who are important here. In many parts of Australia they are currently facing extreme circumstances with the drought, and the government are certainly going to look after their interests with what we do as we move forward in this very challenging circumstance. So, of course, we will use all the mechanisms available to us to seek the views of growers, industry organisations and industry representatives.
