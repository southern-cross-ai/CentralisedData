        My question is to the Minister for Housing. What is the Albanese Labor government doing to improve the housing affordability challenges confronting Australia?

         I want to thank the member for Hunter. I know that he's very engaged in making sure that more of his constituents have a safe and affordable place to call home, because those of us on this side of the House—and, I'm sure, some on the other side—understand that safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians. We're also aware, of course, that rising interest rates and costs and supply issues have impacted on housing affordability right across the country. Indeed, far too many Australians are being hit by increasing rents, far too many Australians are struggling to afford to be able to buy a home and, sadly, far too many Australians are at risk of experiencing homelessness or are experiencing homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that there are no quick solutions, but that's why our government has hit the ground running to deliver on our ambitious housing reform agenda with immediate action alongside our medium- and long-term goals. We've acted very quickly, by widening the remit of the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to allow it to invest in social and affordable housing by unlocking up to $575 million. This support will build on our commitment to build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties through a $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. We've had two meetings of state and territory housing ministers, and that first meeting was our first in almost five years, because, of course, those on the other side deemed this not necessary. And our second meeting was at the end of the last sitting week.
        </p>

         We've also brought forward the regional first home buyer guarantee to this weekend. So, from 1 October, eligible Australians in regional areas will be assisted into homeownership sooner. By helping regional Australians get into their first home with a deposit as little as five per cent, our commitment will help cut down one of the biggest burdens potential homebuyers face and will bring the great Australian dream back into the reach of many.

         CoreLogic is saying that the average homebuyer in regional Australia now has to save for over 11 years for a deposit to get into the current housing market. We need to make it easier for those people who want to be able to live and work in our regions. We know, of course, that more Australians are also having trouble with rent, because they've been unable to buy their own home, and that these measures will help ease pressures for those trying to find a home in the tight rental market.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're also going to introduce our National Housing Supply and Affordability Council, to ensure that the Commonwealth plays a leadership role in increasing housing supply and improving affordability. We've hit the ground running, as I said. We want to bring new national leadership to housing. We want to get more homes on the ground sooner, for more Australians to have a safe and affordable place to call home. Given over the weekend the opposition over there confirmed that they don't have any policies, I look forward to their support for delivering on our ambitious agenda so that more Australians have a safe place to call home.
