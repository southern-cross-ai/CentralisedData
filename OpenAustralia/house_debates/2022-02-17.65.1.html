       <p>
        A few of my colleagues have talked about the crisis in aged care. I am here to talk about the crisis we are currently facing in disability. It frustrates me that here at we are at the end of a sitting fortnight and the government has been focused on almost everything but the impact the pandemic is having on our sectors most in need of support—aged care and disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        To sum up the experience of disability, I will highlight one of the experiences of one of the providers in my area. The

        ; they don't get access to the national stockpile. When they put the order in it takes weeks and weeks for it to arrive. There is little financial support for staff trying to jump over hurdles of safety and wellbeing of clients, and they are struggling.
