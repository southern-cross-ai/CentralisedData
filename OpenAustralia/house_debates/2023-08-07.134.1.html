       <p>
        Today I stand before you filled with immense pride and excitement at being able to share with you the developments that have taken place during my trip to Malaysia. I had the honour of representing the Australian government at the opening ceremony of NEXTDC's first overseas data centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petaling_Jaya" rel="nofollow">
         Petaling Jaya
        </a>
        , Selangor, Malaysia. This significant milestone not only highlights the growing economic partnership between Australia and Malaysia but also marks a significant step forward in our collaboration on the digital front.
       </p>
       <p>
        In today's interconnected world, data has become the lifeblood of the global economy. It flows ceaselessly across borders, transcending geographical limitations, and driving innovation, productivity and growth. Recognising the vital importance of the digital economy, Australia and Malaysia have made it a priority under our comprehensive strategic partnership. This commitment highlights our shared belief in the power of digital collaboration and our determination to use it for mutual prosperity. The Australian government embraces its commitment to deepen economic links, foster trade, and promote investment with Malaysia and the wider region. This way, we unlock exciting new markets and opportunities for Australian businesses, who stand to benefit greatly from this significant relationship. As we forge stronger ties and facilitate the flow of trade and investment, we open doors to innovation, job creation and economic growth that will benefit both our nations.
       </p>
       <p>
        NEXTDC's decision to establish its first overseas data centre in Malaysia speaks volumes about the confidence and trust they place in our economic partnership. I would like to take this moment to acknowledge and commend the effort of the Albanese Labor government in building up and reconnecting the neglected relationship with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        region. Through the government's dedication and vision, we have been able to foster strong connections with our South-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        neighbours. I would like to extend my gratitude to the foreign minister for her tireless effort in ensuring that our relationship with Malaysia is on track for progress. Her commitment to diplomacy and collaboration has played a pivotal role in strengthening the ties between our nations. Our thanks go to her and to the Minister for Trade and Tourism for the commendable job he is doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        This partnership between Australia and Malaysia in the digital space is not merely confined to infrastructure development. It is about fostering collaboration, sharing knowledge and promoting innovation. By aligning our expertise, we can address the challenges of our digital era together, driving the adoption of emerging technologies, enhancing cybersecurity measures and promoting ethical use of data. Our joint efforts will enable us to unlock the full potential of the digital economy, creating opportunities for our citizens and ensuring that our countries remain at the forefront of global innovation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I reflect on my visit to Malaysia and the opening of NEXTDC's data centre project, I am filled with optimism and excitement. The bonds between Malaysia and Australia continue to grow stronger, and it is through such collaborations that we shape a future in which our two nations can thrive together.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I want to express my gratitude to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian High Commission
        </a>
        for its warm hospitality and to NEXTDC for its commitment to strengthening our economic partnership. Together, let us seize the opportunities that lie ahead, navigate the digital landscape with confidence, and build a future that is defined by shared prosperity and limitless possibilities.
