       <p>
        I also commend the member for Mallee for that riveting contribution because men are quite often in denial about their health, and so I encourage them to take advantage of the awareness campaigns for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_Health_Week" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I am here tonight to talk about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        and the lack thereof, or the lack thereof of service. I got a letter last week from Rudi in Pearce who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We signed up to NBN last October. For a while it seemed to work well, then one by one the wheels fell off and I live to regret the decision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first regret was that our back-to-base alarm system wouldn't work with the NBN. We had to get an entirely new system that was wireless.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The next regret was the loss of facsimile services. They won't work with the NBN either. Our perfectly good fax machine went to the tip.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Then, early in 2018, we started to get outages—every day for lengthy periods.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rudi got in touch with the Telstra fault line.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Telstra fault line goes direct to their offshore call centre/s, and we always got the same response—very sorry but don't worry. We'll fix it for you.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I started documenting the outages—four or five every day and for many hours at times
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Telstra sent a technician to the house. He fiddled and snipped at some ancient wiring but that didn't help for long.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Telstra then said they'd get an NBN technician to come to the house.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Three appointments were made, no-one came, no-one did the courtesy of phoning us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the fourth appointment a technician finally turned up, grumbling about the nonsense of trying to connect 21st century technology to ancient copper wiring.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm with the technician: 21st century technology and ancient copper wiring do not mix; they do not work together.
