        In my electorate throughout the north-west coast, west coast and

        communities there is example after example of tireless volunteers making our community what it is. It is an honour for me to inform members present today of the work of one such gentleman: Mr Trevor Kingston of Smithton. Trevor is the kind of bloke everyone wants to have in their communityâ€”a hardworking, caring man dedicated to helping others. The long-time chief of the Smithton Fire Brigade has recently been awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fire_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Fire Service Medal
        </a>
        by the Governor-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Bryce" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Being awarded such a prestigious medal is recognition of almost four decades of hard work and dedication Trevor has contributed not only to his brigade but also to the community of Smithton. Trevor has seen the ups and downs, experiencing the best and worst moments that the job has to offer. Battling fires close to home and interstate, Trevor is always the first on hand in the case of an emergency. Over the years Trevor has joined with the brigade overseeing the introduction of the high-tech pager system as well as upgraded truck filters with high-flow pumps.

       <p>
        A humble man, Trevor did not accept this award on his own; he dedicated it to the members of his brigade, saying that their desire to work as a team as well as taking pride in what they do helps it to be so efficient. I have no doubt that when Trevor signed himself up as a volunteer all those years ago he would not have pictured himself where he is today: an honoured man worthy to be recognised in this parliament for his service to his community. With Trevor Kingston, Smithton is in great hands.
