       <p>
        I rise to update the House today about an important issue in my electorate of Swan which I am pleased to inform the members saw a very organised act of people power win out against one of Australia's biggest corporations, Woolworths, through its subsidiary
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALH" rel="nofollow">
         ALH
        </a>
        holdings. The members would agree that we all promote the concept of people power. But too often it gets caught up in or crushed by bureaucracy. But not this timeâ€”so far. On 17 February, I joined with my state government colleague the member for

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGrath" rel="nofollow">

        , my local government colleagues from the city of South Perth, and local residents from my electorate in Swan, in once again opposing an unnecessary and non-compliant booze barn liquor outlet which has been proposed in my electorate of Swan at the heritage listed Como Hotel site, which currently has a small liquor store in there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members may recall me discussing this issue in this place previously. On 15 August, the West Metropolitan Central Joint Development Assessment Panel rejected the applicant's appeal against the City of South Perth's decision. Being a big business, the applicant did not accept this was the will of the people and instead pushed ahead with another appeal. Today, however, I am pleased to inform members that again on 17 February, people power and common sense once again prevailed, with the panel once again rejecting Woolworths's ALH Group's application to build a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Murphy's" rel="nofollow">
         Dan Murphy's
        </a>
        liquor store on that site. As Swan's federal representative I was very proud to witness so many of my constituents working together to ensure this development, which would have had an adverse impact on their suburb's amenity and which has a potential to create a range of social issues, was not permitted to proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate each resident on the decisive arguments they presented at the JDAP hearings and for the time they have dedicated over the past year in opposing this burdensome development. As I said in my submission to the panel, there is no case for an additional liquor store in that area, contrary to the claims made by the applicant. As yet, I have not received any correspondence from, or had any representations made by, residents calling for a booze barn style liquor outlet in our region. In fact, to approve it would fly in the face of the efforts by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         West Australian
        </a>
        state government and many community groups to help combat Australia's binge drinking culture. Combating this is something I am very passionate about. I am sure members will agree that there would be a clear contradiction in our society if a liquor store development such as this were to be approved when there are already five existing liquor stores within close proximity.
       </p>
       <p>
        'Alcohol. Think again' is the name of the WA state government's anti-alcohol campaign. Just as they are trying to tell the West Australian people to think about alcohol, I would encourage Woolworths, through ALH, to think before once again trying to develop this booze barn liquor outlet in Como. Local residents do not want it and the Como Hotel certainly does not need it. I am certain ALH are going to attempt a third shot at trying to get the store up, but I support the residents in continuing to fight it.
