        Last Saturday I had the privilege of being invited to Calvary Christian Church's Movember men's breakfast. It was fantastic to see men's mental health issues front and centre on the agenda. This event consisted of a slow-cooked

        breakfast, which gave me a chance to chat with other blokes. As you can tell, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, I think I overindulged. It also featured a panel of people who have endured their own mental health challenges. It was an honour to join celebrity chef Matt Golinski, who tragically lost his wife and three daughters in a house fire, and former Cowboys winger

        , who has had his own challenges. These men have had firsthand experience of what it's like to feel the lows and to need some extra support, but they also reached out to get the help they needed to come out the other side. It was great to hear their stories. They also shared with the group the need to keep up their mental health fitness and to continue to look after themselves as they carry on with their careers.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a great morning and an excellent reminder for blokes to not bottle things up but to speak up and speak out. More and more men are realising that it's okay not to be okay. By talking about mental illness and the importance of mental health, we can go a long way towards preventing long-term problems. I know that this event will have started long and important conversations, and I look forward to supporting this event next year.
