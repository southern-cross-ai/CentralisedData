       <p>
        The Modern Slavery Amendment (Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner) Bill 2023 is a vital step in combating modern slavery. It establishes a new commissioner to support victim-survivors of modern slavery practices and to fight slavery in Australia and overseas. However, I share the views of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Council
        </a>
        of Trade Unions. Often I don't share the views of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
         ACTU
        </a>
        , but this time I do! Human rights experts and civil society groups said the bill must be improved upon and the commissioner's role and independence bolstered considerably. Such an important role must be empowered and resourced to work most effectively from its inception. That is why I am moving these amendments: to require Australian entities and entities carrying on business in Australia to assist the commissioner in addressing modern slavery; to require entities to undertake due diligence to address risks of modern slavery practices in their operations and supply chain, rather than just reporting risks; to increase the commissioner's focus on helping to identify and provide support for victims-survivors, including helping them with complaints and referrals; to enable the commissioner to provide advice to the minister on modern slavery matters on their own instigation rather than only at the minister's request—and I think this is particularly critical; to clarify that the commissioner can conduct general inquiries but cannot interfere with enforcement agencies' investigations; to require the commissioner to consult more broadly with victims-survivors, civil society, business, government agencies and strategic planning; and, finally, to set a three-year time frame for a statutory review of the commissioner's budget to make sure they are appropriately resourced.
       </p>
       <p>
        While slavery still flourishes in the shadows both in private industry and under some government and military regimes, we need to equip the new Australian Anti-Slavery Commissioner to take the fight to modern slavery. This applies whether that slavery takes place on our shores or in the supply chains of goods that end up here.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank Be Slavery Free for their work with civil society and other groups to achieve a better bill. In the words of Be Slavery Free, 'Modern slavery is a horrendous and growing crime in Australia and globally.'
       </p>
       <p>
        An independent well resourced antislavery commissioner is essential to strengthen Australia's response and supporting government departments, businesses and civil society groups including victims-survivors. Once appointed this person will become a magnet for advice, support, education and awareness raising related to modern slavery. The position must have the scope, independence and resources to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge former senator Rex Patrick who, in the previous parliament, brought legislation to the parliament to ban the importation of products into Australia which used the forced labour of the Uyghur people, which formed the genesis of my own 2021 private member's bill. I call on the government and on every member of parliament to consider these important amendments to make the Anti-Slavery Commissioner as effective as they possibly can be from the inception. I commend these amendments to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question negatived.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.
