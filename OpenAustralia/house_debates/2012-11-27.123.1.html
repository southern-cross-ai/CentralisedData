        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p>
        That:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) standing order 31 (Automatic adjournment of the House) and standing order 33 (Limit on business after normal time of adjournment) be suspended for this sitting;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) from 9.30 p.m. until the adjournment of the House, any division on a question called for in the House, other than on a motion moved by a Minister during this period, shall stand deferred until 9 a.m. tomorrow;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) from 9.30 p.m. until the adjournment of the House, if any member draws the attention of the Speaker to the state of the House, the Speaker shall announce that she will count the House at 9 a.m. tomorrow, if the Member then so desires; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the member for Dobell was about to seek the call and almost got it, we will allow the member for Dobell to make a contribution to the legislation that was being debated prior to my adjournment of that item. We will then adjourn that item and move to the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012. We will then be enabled, as a result of this motion, to have a number of contributions to the debate on water. But, as a result of the carriage of this motion, there will not be divisions or quorums after 9.30 pm this evening, the normal time for putting the question for the adjournment in the House. That will facilitate members who feel that it is important to make a contribution on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill. There are at least three remaining packages—the water legislation, the gambling legislation and the superannuation legislation—that need to be carried by this chamber by close of business tomorrow in order for them to be considered by the Senate and returned potentially to the House so that we do not have to sit on Friday.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have consulted with the Manager of Opposition Business about this motion. Indeed, it was the position of the Manager of Opposition Business that he wanted to debate the water legislation rather than the gambling legislation in substance this evening in terms of the list. I have accommodated the member for Sturt because of my generous nature as a member of the great

        . Hence I commend this motion to the House.
