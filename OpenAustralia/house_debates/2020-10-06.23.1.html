        I cannot remember visiting the Parramatta Memorial Swimming Club and not seeing Kevin Hession there. It seemed he'd been there forever. He was the life of the pool and the pool side. Sadly, he passed away of a heart attack at 89â€”but what a legacy he left us! The Parramatta Memorial Swimming Club has had the privilege of having Kevin as a dedicated volunteer since he became a founding member in 1964. So, as far as the club is concerned, he had actually been there forever.
       </p>
       <p>
        He volunteered tirelessly and with endless enthusiasm for 56 years. He devoted his life to teaching countless people to swim through the Learn to Swim program, squad training and the formation of the water polo and life-saving sub-branches of the club. He believed that swimming was a sport that one day not only may save your own life but also may save others. He was just there, day after day, week after week, year after year, decade after decade, as he taught people who had children and then he taught them. He was central to the creation of this wonderful cross-generational community that is the Parramatta Memorial Swimming Club. He was a true example of commitment and community spirit and he inspired so many.
       </p>

        My heartfelt condolences to his family. There are a lot of them, so I won't name them, except to say to his great-grandchildren, Peyton, Harper, Arianna, Lucious and Tommy, who loaned him to us: your granddad was much loved, and heading down to the pool just won't be the same without him for any of us. Thank you, Kevin. You are still in our hearts.
