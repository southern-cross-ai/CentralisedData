       <p>
        I rise to comment upon a number of events that occurred in my electorate yesterday. Firstly, there was the inaugural opening of the Caroline Springs Market. The Caroline Springs Market is going to be an extraordinary social and economic boon for a very fast-growing community in western Melbourne. There were already 140 stalls in place when the new market was opened.

        Yesterday I was in the company of the Mayor of Melton, Councillor Chris Papas; the local state member and Minister for

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend_Lease" rel="nofollow">
         Lend Lease
        </a>
        were in attendance. I have not always agreed with the decisions of Delphin, but primarily I have agreed with the direction in which they have taken the community. They are very proactive and they have shown in this instance that they have an interest in ensuring that they do not just build suburbs but also involve themselves in the community. I acknowledge their efforts in that regard. I would also like to pay tribute to the Caroline Springs Community Development Association and the Caroline Springs Residents Association. They are very active community organisations who involve themselves in the community. I have to applaud their efforts.
