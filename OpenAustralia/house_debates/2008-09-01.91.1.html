       Dear Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 27 May 2008 about a petition presented by the Speaker of the House on 26 May 2008 about access to pension entitlements from Latvia.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I am pleased to inform you that Australian and Latvian officials are negotiating a proposed Social Security Agreement between Australia and Latvia (the Agreement). The proposed Agreement will coordinate the two countries’ social security schemes to provide improved social security coverage for people who have lived and worked in Australia and Latvia. The Agreement will, among other things, seek to ensure people living in Australia can access any Latvian pension entitlements they may have.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Officials in Australia and Latvia are continuing to work collaboratively to finalise negotiations. Once finalised the proposed Agreement must be submitted to both Governments for approval. I am hopeful that this will occur in 2008-09.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you again for writing.

       Australian and Latvian officials are negotiating a proposed bilateral Social Security Agreement that will coordinate the two countries’ social security schemes. Negotiation of such agreements is the responsibility of the Hon Jenny Macklin MP, Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to whom I understand you have also written. In view of this, I ask that you refer to the written response being provided by the Hon Ms Macklin.
