         <p>
          Today I want to acknowledge some of the really great fighters for rural Australia, in contrast to the last speaker. I am referring to the mob from Emerald Creek: the Rural Action Council of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           Far North Queensland
          </a>
          , under the leadership of Johnny Gambino and the secretary, Bernie O'Shea. These groups have been not only battling for their own horticulture industry but also for the sugar and banana industries. Between them I think maybe seven or eight thousand people have attended their rallies and meetings. So we pay them a very great tribute.
         </p>
         <p>
          I will name them: Bernie O'Shea, the secretary; Joe Moro, who has been one of our great strengths and one of the most responsible leaders in agriculture throughout Australia; Scotty Dixon, one of the greatest fighters you will ever meet; Ned Brischetto, always sound and solid; Vince Mete, a person whom we all have great admiration for; Maxie Srhoj, who is the person most responsible for me leaving the National Party and becoming an Independent;
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gambino" rel="nofollow">
           John Gambino
          </a>
          , who has just given us absolutely fabulous leadership over a very long period of time—almost half his lifetime; Emedio Nicolosi, a good man always;
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henderson" rel="nofollow">
           Peter Henderson
          </a>
          ; the late Eddie Bernabei, and what a great fighter he was;
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Daley" rel="nofollow">
           Peter Daley
          </a>
          in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          , another great leader who has been working very hard with them on what we now call the Emerald Creek Declaration; and Timmy Belden and Johnny Pitcherillo on the Murray-Darling. In the remaining time I will read into
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          what will become famous as the Emerald Creek Declaration. These are the men who have put together what needs to be done for fruit and vegetable growers throughout Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some three or four years ago this country of ours became a net importer of fruit and vegetables. In five years this country will not be able to feed itself. Unless the Emerald Creek Declaration is accepted this country will not be able to feed itself. When we march to the drum played by Woolworths and Coles we then condemn our country to the most dreadful future.
         </p>
         <p>
          Let me read this into
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          . I ask for a sales docket. Why can't we get a sales docket? Every single sale that takes place in this country gets a sales docket, except the fruit and vegetable growers of Australia. I have not got time to tell you why not. But of course we know who profits by there being no sales docket.
         </p>
         <p>
          The money from the sale must go into a market authority account—a trust fund—the same as in real estate and the same as in other activities of this nature. Coles and Woolworths have to be brought down to a 22.5 per cent maximum market share. There are something like 20 books out on Wal-Mart, all condemning the company and its influence in America, and it has only 16.1 per cent, whereas our people in Australia have over 85 per cent.
