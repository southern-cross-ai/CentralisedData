        The troubles the government are having at the moment are very interesting. It casts one's mind back to some of the things they are on the record saying about leadership. We all know that this building this morning is all about leadership. I had a bit of a look at some of the Twitter commentary on Buzzfeed 'politics' today. They have some very good quotes from leading government members when they were in opposition. I think my favourite is, 'Leadership chatter is all about a government sacking itself for its own poor performance'. That was

        on 23 June 2010 on Twitter.

       <p>
        We all know what this country is crying out for: a government that is focused on jobs, on building the economy, on infrastructure, on providing universal health care, on looking towards the challenges of the future, on giving our young people a fighting chance, on looking after those in regional and remote Australia, on tackling disadvantage and on advancing Australia. That is what this country wants. It wants a government focused on the people of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        What have we got from the government? I will tell you: we have a government that is focused on itself and on its own internal dynamics. Barely a day goes by when you do not read in the paper some quote—anonymous—about how the Prime Minister is going to face a challenge. But let's go back in time and look at what

        said. He said: 'Wow, another press conference about the Labor Party. That change really worked. Will the Australian people get a look in?'
       </p>
       <p>
        Scott Morrison again, 'I mean, stability and consistency is on the coalition side'.

          We are certainly seeing that today! Another quote from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
           Scott Morrison
          </a>
          , this time quoting a constituent, 'Same smelly feet, different pair of socks'. He could be talking about the present situation.

          said, 'People right around this country, whether they own their own business or not, look to Canberra and see no adult in charge'. That is certainly the case now.
         </p>
         <p>
          And of course
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
           Tony Abbott
          </a>
          , 24 February 2012 on Twitter: 'We are ready. I lead a stable and united team, a contrast to the other side'. Nothing could be further from the truth. This government said it would be stable. That was a fundamental promise that it made to the Australian people. And what do we see in the run-up to the Canning by-election? Instability, chaos, backbiting, infighting. That is what we see from this government.
