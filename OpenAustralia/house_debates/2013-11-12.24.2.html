       <p class="italic">
        That Mr Scott be elected Deputy Speaker of this House.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is my great pleasure to nominate my friend and colleague the member for Maranoa for the position of Deputy Speaker.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Scott" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Scott
        </a>
        is my electorate neighbour. We came into the parliament at the same time and I have very much admired his contribution to the parliament over the years. He has a very large electorate—almost three-quarters of a million square kilometres touching the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        borders. Of course he has already served in this House with distinction as Deputy Speaker since 2012, and it is testament to the member for Maranoa that he was nominated for that post by the member for Sturt and seconded by the then Independent member for New England. I am sure that the new member for New England will be equally enthusiastic about the appointment of the member for Maranoa to this position.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Maranoa brought dignity to the chair and a wealth of experience—experience gained also from the earlier time that he had spent as Second Deputy Speaker from 2008 and, earlier than that, from 2002 to 2007 as a member of the Speaker's panel. So he is a veteran of this House and its procedures in both government and opposition. Earlier he had served as a minister, for 5½ years, in the Veterans' Affairs portfolio and also as Assistant Minister for Defence. The Veterans' Affairs portfolio can be quite a difficult one, but he met those challenges with a great degree of enthusiasm, and Bruce and Joan were very popular figures in the veteran community during his time in that office. He delivered benefits to 350,000 veterans based on world's best practice medicine and delivery of services. He also introduced the highly successful Their Service—Our Heritage commemorative program and oversaw the upgrading and expansion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        in Canberra. He even gave the vets Viagra!
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond his parliamentary career, Bruce came to the parliament with a history of service to primary industry as a merino wool and prime lambs producer and an industry leader. I am certain that, as Deputy Speaker, he would be a person that you, Madam Speaker, could rely on. He would greatly support you in your task of restoring respect and dignity to the chair and of course to the House. It is with great pleasure that I nominate Bruce Scott for a return to the position of Deputy Speaker.

         </a>
         certainly summed up the qualifications of Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Scott" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Scott
         </a>
         for this job. As an indication of the size of his electorate, not only is he a neighbour of the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Wide Bay
         </a>
         but also his electorate adjoins my electorate for about 400 or 500 kilometres along the Queensland-

         </a>
         border. Bruce Scott is eminently suitable for this job because, while he is a man of Western Queensland—a man for the Maranoa and places like Birdsville—he is very much at home in this chamber. He honours the traditions of this place, and it is great testament to him that he can be just as at home in the Birdsville pub as in the chair of this chamber. I have great pleasure in seconding the nomination from the Leader of The Nationals for the member for Maranoa to be Deputy Speaker.

          That Mr Mitchell be elected Deputy Speaker of this House.
         </p>
         <p>
          In speaking to the motion I want to extend my congratulations to you, Madam Speaker, on your election earlier today. There were fewer swinging voters than I might have hoped for, but I wish you well in taking on your very important role.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have extolled the virtues of the member for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
           McEwen
          </a>
          previously today and I will not needlessly detain the House by repeating them, although the member for McEwen said it would be all right with him if I did. In moving this motion I intend no disrespect to the member for Maranoa. The House will understand that this is a ballot for two positions—it is an 'every player gets a prize' ballot. The member for Maranoa is well respected by people on this side of the House for his extensive service on the Speaker's panel—indeed, he was the only member from the opposition side of the parliament who served as a member of the Speaker's panel, and we would have been happy to have seen him put forward earlier today. Indeed, not only is he well supported on this side of the House; he is strongly supported by his own electorate and is well able to repel challengers from both our side and closer to home. I am not suggesting that I would encourage my colleagues to vote for him, by the way, but I do wish him all the best as well as wishing the member for McEwen all the best in taking on the important roles which they are soon to undertake.

           Madam Speaker, I too add my congratulations to you on achieving the position of Speaker. I wish you well in this role and I am sure that you will maintain the dignity and respect of the chair vacated by the member for Chisholm—not reinstate but maintain the dignity of that chair—and I am sure that you will do noble deeds with wisdom, good humour and tolerance. And, perhaps, in the light of earlier comments, your memory on occasion might be a little bit patchy, hopefully!

           </a>
           be elected Deputy Speaker. But I do respectfully disagree with the member for Wills on one thing. I know the member for Maranoa's seat very well. I grew up in St George; it is my home town. In fact, I went out to St George after the election and formed a new branch of the

             knocked two per cent off the member for Maranoa's margin. That is the reason I want to put forward the member for

              McEwen
             </a>
             for Deputy Speaker—because the member for McEwen represents a marginal seat, and a marginal seat brings a certain perspective to the parliament. With all respect to you, Madam Speaker, and to the member for Maranoa, it does bring a different relationship. I have been often been told by the member for Sturt—he assured me at each election—that I would not be here after the next election. He assured me. He even said it on the record—

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
                McEwen
               </a>
               can maintain the dignity and respect of the chair. It would also let the member for Maranoa concentrate on his electorate—defending that margin—where the Labor Party has taken a bit of skin off him.
              </p>
              <p>
               The member for McEwen would obviously provide a lot of experience, having sat on the Speaker's panel previously. His becoming Deputy Speaker would be in keeping with the document signed by the member for Sturt saying that the Deputy Speaker should actually be a member of the opposition—a piece of paper by the member for Sturt, in writing, said that the Deputy Speaker should be from the opposition. In that context, obviously the Deputy Speaker should be the member for McEwen. We should honour that piece of writing put forward by the member for Sturt. I would be happy to table that document signed by the member for Sturt. It is in writing. It would be a great gesture from the Prime Minister and from you, Madam Speaker, to indicate a new spirit of bipartisanship in this 44th Parliament. I do not in any way mean to detract from the qualities of the member for Maranoa; he is a gentleman, someone that I trust. I was at the theatre with him last weekend, in fact. Sorry to say that, Member for Maranoa! I would ask you and all of your colleagues to support the nomination of the member for McEwen because he would bring great vitality to the role. He has, occasionally, been thrown out of the parliament, but only two times in the 43rd Parliament. As you well know, Madam Speaker, being thrown out two times in the 43rd Parliament, in a robust parliament, is not a stain on his character at all. So I would ask members to consider the member for McEwen as Deputy Speaker rather than the member for Maranoa.

                 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate both Mr Scott and Mr Mitchell on their election to the great office of the deputy speakership. I know that both of them will discharge their duties with diligence and with competence. I know that both of them will work to support you in your high office. I know that you will not need to be supported in many respects, but you will certainly love the encouragement that they will both give you, and it is nice to think that there will be some collegiality in the office of the Speaker. So, Madam Speaker, I think you can be confident that the speakership, one way or another, whoever is in the chair, will be well and truly discharged in the 44th Parliament.

                  . Without doubt, the member for Maranoa is very experienced. He served on the Speaker's panel in the 42nd Parliament. He was Second Deputy Speaker in the 43rd Parliament. He served as Deputy Speaker. I am pleased to also see that he is still in the parliament and that obviously his local members of the National Party had a great deal of confidence in him and reselected him—a choice I can understand. He is well respected across the parties. Member for Maranoa, we would also like you to please pass on our thanks to Joan for yet again lending you to this parliament to serve in this capacity.

He even was an apprentice bookmaker. I think this breadth of tasks and occupations will suit him as he deals with the disparate personalities in this House of Representatives.

                    on being elected as deputy speakers of the parliament. The team offer to the parliament experience in the chair and a willingness and determination, I am sure, to make the parliament ahead work just as smoothly and as constructively as it possibly can.

                    I am aware that you and the Second Deputy Speaker have, from time to time, tasted the ire of some of your predecessors, so you are well skilled in the tricks of the trade. I am certain that that will hold you in good stead as you strive to keep order and make sure that the business of the House is transacted in an orderly way. Congratulations on your election. You can be assured of the cooperation of the House in your high office.

I say, in all sincerity—I have spent 40 years in parliament—that Speaker Jenkins was very fair. I can remember—I will be game to put this on record—that my great leader, a man I had immense admiration for, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, when instructing a new Speaker said: 'None of this fairness! It is not about being fair in this place.' I think we can go forward from there. Much as I loved and greatly revered my Premier, I do not think that that is where we want to be going in this parliament.

                       <p>
                        First of all, I congratulate you, Madam Speaker, on the very high office that you have been elected to today. I noticed your lack of reluctance to be dragged to the chair—the Speaker is, traditionally, reluctant—but I know that you are going to fulfil this role with great dignity through your great capacity and through your knowledge of the procedures of the House.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I also acknowledge and congratulate the member for

                        . We have worked together on the Speaker's panel during past parliaments. Numbers count in this place, but I know that, as he fulfils his role as Second Deputy Speaker, the member for McEwen will cooperate with me and with the Speaker.

                       <p>
                        I thank my nominators, the Deputy Prime Minister and the member for Parkes. They are both in neighbouring electorates and I thank them for their very generous comments. I also acknowledge the comments of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I also thank them for recognising my dear wife, who is able to join us in the chamber today. As the Leader of the Opposition said, in this place our partners, wives or husbands, lend us to this place, because being here is a strain on families. I share this moment of great tradition with my family. The privilege of representing the seat of Maranoa in this place comes at a price for the family, and I know I could not have done it without the support of my wife.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I also have in the chamber today my daughter and son-in-law, my chief of staff and my media adviser. It is wonderful to be able to share this moment with the people who have been so supportive throughout my parliamentary career. It is not easy for any of them, including my staff, so it is wonderful to have them here to share this very proud moment.

                        -General said, in the Senate this afternoon, that there is a new page being turned on this 44th Parliament. It really is in the hands of each of us. If we want the respect of our electorates and the people of Australia, who are demanding high standards and a change of conduct—I will put it that way—we should realise that it is in our hands. I can assure you that I will do my part working with you, Madam Speaker, and the Second Deputy Speaker to make sure that we allow robust debate but that there is civility in the chamber, because the population of Australia is looking forward to an improvement on what they may have seen in years past. I will do my utmost to make judgements in this place that are fair, equitable and even handed.

I take it as an enormous privilege to serve as the Deputy Speaker and I once again thank all those who have made very kind comments about me, my wife Joan and my family, who share in this proud moment.

                        <p>
                         I, too, rise to thank the House for the support and for the opportunity to be Second Deputy Speaker in the 44th Parliament. I look forward to working closely with you, Madam Speaker, and with the Deputy Speaker to soak up the experience of your knowledge and your years of wisdom in this place. I hope to get in before the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and grab that dog-eared book; I think it would be better for me than her. I want to thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Greens for their words. It is a very humbling position to be put in, and I look forward to carrying it out to the best of my abilities to ensure that this place is run fairly and equally and that we have good, robust debate in a very well-mannered way. We need to make sure that the House runs properly and runs with the support of all members of the parliament.
