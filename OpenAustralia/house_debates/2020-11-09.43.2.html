        Our democracy depends on diverse sources of reliable, accurate and independent news. But media ownership is becoming more concentrated alongside new business models that encourage deliberately polarising and politically manipulated news. We are especially concerned that Australia's print media is overwhelmingly controlled by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         News Corporation
        </a>
        , founded by Fox News billionaire
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch" rel="nofollow">
         Rupert Murdoch
        </a>
        , with around two-thirds of daily newspaper readership. This power is routinely used to attack opponents in business and politics by blending editorial opinion with news reporting. Australians who hold contrary views have felt intimidated into silence. These facts chill free speech and undermine public debate. Powerful monopolies are also emerging online, including Facebook and Google. We are deeply concerned by: mass-sackings of news journalists; digital platforms impacting on media diversity and viability; Nine Entertainment's takeover of the

         Sydney Morning Herald
        </a>
        ; News Carp's acquisition (and then closure) of more than 200 smaller newspapers, undermining regional and local news; attempts to replace

        independence and funding. Professional journalists further have legitimate concerns around unjust searches, potential prosecution, whistle-blower protection, official secrecy and dispute resolution that should be comprehensively addressed. Only a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        would have the powers and independence to investigate threats to media diversity, and recommend policies to ensure optimal diversity across all platforms to help guarantee our nation's democratic future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to support the establishment of such a Royal Commission to ensure the strength and diversity of Australian news media.

        from 501,876 citizens (Petition No. EN1938)
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        The principal petitioner is former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. It is also signed by former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Begun just a month ago, this is the largest e-petition in our parliament's history, and I thank each of the 501,876 people who signed it. We, in this parliament, are the servants of the people, and a vital part of our job is to table the views of citizens.

        Yesterday,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden" rel="nofollow">
         Joe Biden
        </a>
        called on his country to 'marshal the forces of decency and the forces of fairness'. Essential to this is media accuracy and diversity. Yet Biden has faced forces like Fox News, which has downplayed coronavirus, touted hydroxychloroquine, perpetuated climate change denial and called refugees 'an invasion'. There's nothing fair or balanced in the way they have treated politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia, the media is shrinking and extremely concentrated. From 2006 to 2016, the number of journalists fell nine per cent. Health reporting is down 30 per cent. Science reporting is down 42 per cent. Hundreds of local newspapers have closed. Yet the Morrison government is cutting the ABC. There are now over 20 'news deserts' in Australia, which weakens the community and raises the risk of corruption going unchecked. Diverse choices of reliable, accurate and independent news are fundamental to our democracy—
