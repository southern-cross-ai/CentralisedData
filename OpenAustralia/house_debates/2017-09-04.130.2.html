        I rise today to recognise the outstanding commitment to education shown by the many teaching and support staff in schools in my electorate and to say just a few words about them. On Friday just gone, I was invited to speak at the inaugural Warnbro cell excellence in education awards, held at the Mary Davies Library and Community Centre, in Baldivis. These awards recognise the outstanding contributions made by both teaching and support staff in the network of the Warnbro cell schools. Local primary schools, education support centres and a high school comprise this cell of schools, which is responsible for educating hundreds of young people in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to mention one of the special guests at the awards, Jodie Schicker, the 2016 WA Premier's Primary School Teacher of the Year. During the non-sitting weeks, I had the pleasure of being a guest in one of Ms Schicker's science classes. She is an inspiration in the classroom. She is a passionate local teacher. Ms Schicker is the head of science at Bungaree Primary School, in Rockingham, and she's committed to engaging children in science, tech, engineering and maths subjects through innovative teaching methods.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like Ms Schicker, the school staff recognised in the excellence in education awards are also making outstanding contributions to education. The awards took a comprehensive look at the staff and schools responsible for ensuring that our schools are places of educational excellence for pupils: teachers, education assistants, gardeners, library officers, cleaners, school officers and corporate service managersâ€”the list is long. Without the contributions and dedication of the whole school community, a quality education will not be possible. All those who received an award on Friday were chosen by their colleagues, and this makes their awards even more special. There's nothing like peer recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Warnbro cell of schools comprises Rockingham Lakes Primary School, Peel Language Development School, Warnbro Community High School, Warnbro Community High School Education Support Centre, Endeavour Primary School, Endeavour Education Support Centre, Koorana Primary School, Warnbro Primary School and Port Kennedy Primary School. I'd like to congratulate all award winners on their passion for excellence in education and congratulate those who organised the awards. We know that a good education opens up a world of possibilities and opportunities for children. A good education, it has been said, is the passport to the future. Thanks to the good work of the school staff, the future of the children of Warnbro is bright and full of potential. Educators work hard and do an important job, and it was fantastic to see just some of these dedicated people being recognised for all their work. Again I congratulate all award recipients. Thanks to those who put on this great event, and I look forward to going to the second Warnbro cell awards next year.
