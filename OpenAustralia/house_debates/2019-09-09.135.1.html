        Goldstein's rich social fabric is bound by the bonds that lie at the heart of many of our community organisations—organisations like Probus, which opens its doors to retired men and women to help build friendship, fellowship and new experiences. I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the current leaders of the Probus mission in Goldstein and thank them for their incredible service to our community and for the important role that they play in making sure that retired Australians have every opportunity to live a fulfilled life and to combat the challenges our society faces around social isolation and making sure older Australians remain fit and active and engaged in our community. Of course, we have Beaumaris Probus, particularly their president, Keith Ross, who recently succeeded their past president,
