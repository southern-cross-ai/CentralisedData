        I, like many women working in this place, have come in here every day last week, and again this week, with a sense of dread about what is next, hoping we have heard the worst.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Speaker" rel="nofollow">
         The Speaker
        </a>
        of the Tasmanian parliament, Sue Hickey, has said today in the Tasmanian parliament that she had a conversation with Senator Eric Abetz on 1 March. In relation to the allegations of serious sexual assault against the Attorney-General, Senator Abetz is alleged to have said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …yes, it was the first law officer of the nation,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Porter" rel="nofollow">
         Christian Porter
        </a>
        , but not to worry, the woman is dead and the law will protect him.
       </p>
       <p>
        He then allegedly said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …as for that Higgins girl, anybody who is so disgustingly drunk, who would sleep with anybody, could have slept with one of our spies and put the security of our nation at risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand Senator Abetz has denied these comments and he has questioned the motivations. But I also understand that Speaker Hickey told the Tasmanian Premier about these comments just days after they were made. This is a very serious allegation that is being made against one of the government senators—one of the senators that the government is relying on in the Senate. I trust that the Prime Minister will investigate this disturbing account. My question is: who is going to be believed in this do we think? One of the government senators or the female speaker of the Tasmanian parliament?

         It being almost 2 pm, I ask members to take their seats. In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded.
