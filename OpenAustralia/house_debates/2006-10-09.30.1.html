       <p>
        I am pleased to rise today to speak about the terrific initiative and investment the Howard government has made in a school in my electorate. Merrimac State High School was the beneficiary of a $499,000 Howard government funding grant. The money was spent on a new special education unit. In my electorate there has been a massive underinvestment in new facilities and new resources within the state public education system by the Beattie Labor government. I was pleased the Howard government was able to provide this half a million dollars of funding for Merrimac High to ensure those children with special needs have better opportunities to learn in an environment more conducive to their education. It has also ensured that the thoroughly professional and excellent teaching staff at Merrimac State High School have the kinds of facilities they need to ensure children with learning disabilities can learn in a better environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was pleased to see that, as part of the revamp, the two existing classrooms and computer room were updated and remodelled to become four teaching areas. In addition to that, this half a million dollars ensured the kitchen was upgraded and a disability shower and toilet block were also constructed. This is a thoroughly worthwhile investment, and I congratulate the staff at Merrimac State High School. I am sure with these new facilities the children with special learning needs at that school will go from strength to strength.
