        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians have quickly embraced the development of emerging aviation technologies such as remotely piloted aircraft—otherwise known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPA" rel="nofollow">
         RPA
        </a>
        —systems, also commonly known as drones. RPA systems have presented opportunities for innovation but also new safety challenges to the broader aviation industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        A strong aviation industry requires continuous improvement in the regulatory system which governs it. As more and more RPA systems are flown each year, carrying an increased risk of potential harm they can cause, it is increasingly important for RPA systems to be appropriately regulated to ensure the safety of the public, the drones' pilots and other airspace users.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has placed increased pressure on the government regulators, especially in areas of aviation safety, noise, security, privacy and the environment, to ensure that RPA systems are used in an appropriate manner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's safety regulator, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Civil Aviation Safety Authority
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
         CASA
        </a>
        ) continues to provide regulatory functions to RPA users to ensure the safe and efficient integration of RPA systems into the broader Australian aviation network.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the numbers of RPA system users grow, there is more demand for CASA's regulatory approvals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I introduce into the parliament two bills which will assist CASA to meet this demand and provide appropriate safety guidance, compliance and enforcement services to facilitate safe RPA system use.
       </p>
       <p>
        The principal bill, the Civil Aviation (Unmanned Aircraft Levy) Bill 2020, establishes a legal mechanism that will be used in the future to enable a levy to be cost-recovered from RPA operators.
       </p>
       <p>
        The complementary bill, the Civil Aviation Amendment (Unmanned Aircraft Levy Collection and Payment) Bill 2020 establishes a legal mechanism to collect the levy, whereby the Commonwealth will pay to CASA the levy amounts collected by CASA on behalf of the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        These bills inform the ongoing implementation of government regulation and ensure that commercial RPA system users contribute to the cost of the functions they receive.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cost recovery levy will be set at no cost for the current financial year, and any increase to the cost will be based on evidence collected from the registration scheme, and considered in the context of future funding arrangements for CASA in 2021-22 and the government's broader approach to regulation and service delivery for the RPA sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        These bills will also support CASA's efforts, such as RPA registration, to ensure the long-term safe and lawful operation of RPA systems. Registration of RPA systems will support future RPA compliance activities for a number of different government regulators and will provide further understanding of the scope, size and needs of the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        With that, I commend this bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
