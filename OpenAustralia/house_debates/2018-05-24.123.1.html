        In regard to the contribution of the previous member, I do note that there actually have been two- to three-year delays on a number of drugs recommended by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBAC" rel="nofollow">
         PBAC
        </a>
        under this government. So the government hasn't been listing drugs as soon as PBAC recommends them. I too hope that Orkambi makes it through the PBAC process. It's an important drug for the cystic fibrosis community, but we need to await that process.

        Today marks the midway point of National Volunteer Week, so it is only fitting that I rise to acknowledge the work of volunteers across Australia and particularly within my own electorate of Ballarat. This is one week in which we make an extra effort to acknowledge their tremendous work. But, of course, volunteers don't just work and volunteer in our communities for one week each year; they are out there every single day in every corner of our community helping make our communities a much better place to live and generously donating their time to make our country a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The change and possibilities that come from millions of Australians giving up part of their time each year to help others in their community is reflected in the theme of this year's volunteer week: give a little, change a lot. From Learmonth, Clunes and Daylesford, all the way across the city of Ballarat to Elaine, Ballan and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchus_Marsh" rel="nofollow">
         Bacchus Marsh
        </a>
        , the towns and communities that make up the electorate of Ballarat are driven forwards by a strong ethos of volunteering. These volunteers work in our hospitals, our schools, our aged-care facilities, police stations, neighbourhood houses, fire brigades and occasionally in electorate offices and political parties as well, and almost every other area that you can think of.

        Just last weekend I had the opportunity of joining the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Brown Hill
        </a>
        community in celebrating their volunteers. This tiny neighbourhood of Ballarat has over 350 people who are generously contributing their time to the Brown Hill community. They're contributing their energy, their skills and their commitment to improving that community for all of us. They work at the pool, they help at the school, they organise the annual Brown Hill festival and they're involved with the progress association or Lions clubs or local cricket or football clubs. Together these volunteers are a prime example of how a strong spirit of volunteerism can build a strong, sustainable and healthy community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to offer my thanks to all of the fantastic volunteers within my community and beyond. Our communities would certainly be poorer without you. I'm looking forward to the launch of the last event in volunteers week on this Saturday or this Sunday at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housey_Housey" rel="nofollow">

        in Ballarat, where we'll be celebrating the fantastic contribution of volunteers right the way across our community.
