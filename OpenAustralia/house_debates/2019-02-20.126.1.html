        This year I attended
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        celebrations in Eglinton, Oberon, Lithgow, Wallerawang and Yeoval. It was a great day across the region and a chance to reflect on how lucky we are to be Aussies. Australia Day is a time to celebrate some of the outstanding members and community groups we have. I'd like to recognise the award winners from Portland and Wellington in the Calare electorate.
