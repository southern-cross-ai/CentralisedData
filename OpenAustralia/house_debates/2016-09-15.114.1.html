        Today I rise to acknowledge 67 women who are no longer with us—67 women who died a tragic and violent death, victims of an epidemic of violence against women in Australia. As I did in the last term of parliament, I want to honour and commemorate the lives of these women killed by acts of violence. I do so as a reminder to us all that these women are not just statistics; they are grandmothers, mothers, sisters, daughters, neighbours and colleagues. They are real people with hopes, dreams, friends and family. They loved and were loved. Their deaths are tragic and they diminish us all. I want to acknowledge at the outset the work of the Counting Dead Women Australia researchers of Destroy the Joint, who undertake the heartbreaking task of updating this list of indescribable tragedy.

        Today I want to honour the lives of Johann Morgan, aged 41; Simone Quinlan, aged 33; Jody Meyers, aged 20; Linda Addams, aged 67; Karina Lock, aged 49; Kirralee Paepaerei, aged 37; Corinne Henderson, aged 32; Penny Bailey, aged 59; Gail Parnell, aged 73; Marnie Lee Cave, aged 26; Simone Mottram, aged 51; Rachel Michael, aged 38; Maureen Boyce, aged 68;

        Sadly, a new year did not mean an end to this senseless violence. This year another 48 women have lost their lives through acts of violence—many in their own homes and many at the hands of those well known to them. They are: Valeria Fermendjin, aged 70; Karen Chetcuti, aged 49;

        That this list continues to grow is a national shame. These women's lives must not be lost in vain. They had every right to be safe, to be loved and to have a future. So we must double-down in our efforts to address the cultural, social and systemic causes of this violence. We must do more to ensure access to safe housing for women and children fleeing violence; that legal support is adequate and accessible; and that adequate funding is available to community organisations that are doing the hard work on the ground. Ending violence against women and children must be a priority of all governments.
