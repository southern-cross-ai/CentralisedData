        My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday during question time, the Prime Minister said the government whip would handle complaints about bullying within his government. But today Senator Gichuhi said instead that the Prime Minister has taken up the issue. Does the Prime Minister stand by his answer yesterday, or has the Prime Minister taken personal responsibility to investigate the bullying complaints by his women MPs about other Liberal MPs within his government?

         I thank the member for his question. I take a keen interest in the welfare of every member of my team, and I will continue to do so as I work with all of the members of my team to do something that's very important. The responsibility we have, firstly, is to deliver an even stronger Australia, an Australia where we keep our economy strong so that we can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs was just referring to. That's what we're about. Secondly, we're keeping Australians safe, as my team have been explaining today. Our government is supporting the ADF, our national security agencies, keeping Australians safe online, keeping kids safe in schools: all of these things we're doing to keep Australians safe. Thirdly, to keep Australians together.

            of Opposition Business makes a very good point. The question was about one topic. The Prime Minister can compare and contrast for a limited period of time, which he's done, and I invite him to either come back to the question or wrap up his answer.

             I was asked about the welfare of my members and what role I was playing in dealing with the welfare of my members. What I'm explaining is that I am very keenly interested in the welfare and support that I give to my members for the very important job they have to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             My team is coming together, but more importantly we're bringing Australia together because we don't want to see one set of Australians pitted against another. What we're focused on is meeting the challenges of the future head-on, as a united Australia on the basis of ensuring that Australians work together for that goal.
