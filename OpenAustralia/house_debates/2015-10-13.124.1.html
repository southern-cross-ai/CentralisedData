        Queensland is an organisation that works to ensure their members and indeed the broader sciences industry work together to complement each other's capabilities and demonstrate the importance and relevance of the life sciences industry. Their unquestioned success is due in large part to the energetic Mario Pennisi and his hardworking team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night, Life Sciences hosted their annual Globally Engaging Network Event, or GENE, to acknowledge individuals in Queensland who are contributing to the life sciences sector in a variety of ways. I was very honoured to receive the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSQ" rel="nofollow">
         LSQ
        </a>
        Elected Officials Award for my role in advocacy and promotion of the life sciences industry, which, can I say, is something that I genuinely enjoy doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Queensland has an undisputed reputation for their quality research and outstanding scientists. I am very lucky to have the

        in my electorate, as it gives me the opportunity to see some amazing innovations and discoveries. I have spoken many times in this place about the remarkable individuals and teams who are developing cutting edge solutions within the science and research fields. People like

        , Jurgen Gotz and Maree Smith. It is a privilege to promote the work they do. And I am grateful that my good friends at the University of Queensland Senior Vice-President Max Lu and Vice-Chancellor Peter Hoj keep me updated so I can highlight the achievements and developing research, like that of Dr Kate Schroder and Professor David Fairlie.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I want to acknowledge the award winners from last night, who deserve our accolades and tributes for the extraordinary work they undertake. I recently spoke in this place about Professor Maree Smith, who, after 11 years of research, has received deserved success with her drug for people with neuropathic pain. So I am particularly delighted to be able to inform the House that last night Maree was recognised for her remarkable achievements by becoming the inaugural inductee in the Life Sciences Queensland Hall of Fame. Maree's tireless devotion to her work means hundreds of patients will no longer have to suffer through chronic pain. This is the first time this honour has been awarded, which demonstrates Professor Smith's outstanding hard work and contribution.

        The McCullough Robertson LSQ Industry Excellence Award is given to an individual who has made significant contributions to the performance and success of the Queensland life sciences industry. Last night it was awarded to Dr Dimity Dornan AO, founder of Hear and Say. Dr Dornan does not need an introduction. For more than 20 years she has shown determination and vision to use technology to better the lives of hundreds of deaf children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Commemorative Award was created and named in memory of Rose-Anne Kelso, a physiotherapist and president on the boards of Diabetes Australia Queensland and the Australian Physiotherapy Association Queensland, to recognise an individual female's endeavours, passion and dedication to the health and life sciences industries. This year's recipient was oral health therapist and University of Queensland lecturer Ms Leah Hobbs. Ms Hobbs is committed to improving oral health outcomes in Queensland and vulnerable communities throughout the world, including Vanuatu. She has been involved with the Queensland Centre for Intellectual Impairment and Disability for the past five years and has developed online media for QCIDD patients.
       </p>

        Mr David Camerlengo was this year's recipient of the Trade Commissioners Award. Mr Camerlengo was awarded this honour for his efforts to keep Queensland life sciences capabilities at the forefront of consciousness of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Americans" rel="nofollow">

        with whom he deals in his role as Trade and Investment Officer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regenerative medicine is an incredibly vital area of medicine as it will one day enable us to heal ourselves. The Life Sciences Aon Risk Solutions Regenerative Medicine Award was presented to University of Queensland's Professor Justin Cooper-White, who leads a research group with a focus on tissue engineering and micro fluids that has developed a technology that will accelerate research in stem cell development and regenerative medicine. I am told there were many deserving nominees for this award and it was a most challenging decision to select just one winner.
       </p>
       <p>
        It truly is a privilege for me to be able to promote the remarkable work of Queensland scientists, and once again I want to acknowledge the other award winners, those who make a genuine life-changing contribution to our society. Thank you once again to Life Sciences Queensland. I intend to keep promoting these success stories and Australia's leading role.
