        It is 12 months to the day since the class of 2007 was elected. It is interesting to see that the government have put out a 70-page taxpayer funded glossy brochure to highlight everything that they have done. What have the government done? When I look at my electorate, all I see is misery, pain, inaction and oblivion. In fact, not only have the government just done nothing; they have done less than nothing. They have obliterated the Regional Partnerships program, which leaves organisations in my electorate with no legitimate funding sources. What do I say to the Riding for the Disabled Association, which needs a new roof for its shelter? What do I say to Youth Point Connect and the Coomera and Oxenford youth centre—the only two youth centres in Fadden, which is the fastest growing electorate? What will I say to St Vincent de Paul, who are building homeless shelters? We do not have a single homeless shelter in Fadden—not a single one. What do I say to them? What do I say to businesses that are suffering? What do I say to women like Kay, who I sat next to at a dinner last Saturday night and whose savings have been frozen? She is one of the 270,000 Australians affected by the farce of the Rudd government’s bank guarantee, which has so distorted the financial market.

         On Wednesday, 19 November at the Fremantle Workers’ Club in my electorate, I was honoured to host the presentation of Australian Defence Medals to Oliver Cosgrove, Harry Hickson,

         , Malcolm Shalders and Jerry Koltasz. Jerry has sadly passed away, so his medal was received by his wife Jennie. These medals provide an opportunity to pay tribute to regular and reserve force members who have served four years, completed an enlistment period or re-enlisted since the end of World War

        <p class="italic">
         It was appropriate that the ADF medal presentation took place on 19 November. Members will recall that 19 November was the 67th anniversary of the day 645 Australians perished in the famous and tragic engagement between the

         <p class="italic">
          Farmers in my electorate are understandably concerned with the aggressive attitude taken by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Government" rel="nofollow">
           Queensland Government
          </a>
          in its quest to fill its coffers with money from mining royalties. Farmers are crying out for the Government to see that they are sacrificing our prime agricultural lands and the future security of our clean, green local food sources in favour of coal and gas.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          For a long time these cries fell on deaf ears but the forum on Friday gave me some hope that the Labor Government is finally listening and may do what our farmers have been calling on the government to do for months now, and that is amend the legislation to ensure our prime arable farming lands are protected from mining.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Of course, I am very disappointed that the Minister for Mines and Energy,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
           Geoff Wilson
          </a>
          did not attend and it certainly sent the wrong message to local growers. However, aside from the Mines Minister’s obvious lack of interest in the plight of our farmers, I am giving the Deputy Premier and the Premier the benefit of the doubt and I hope that they realise that the future of Queensland’s rich farm lands lies in their hands.

          <p class="italic">
           Charlie Gregorini was Mayor of the City of Swan, well regarded and very well respected in his local community.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           When I first became the member for Perth, areas of the city of Swan were part of my electorate. Following the creation of the seat of Hasluck at a redistribution, I lost substantial areas of the City of Swan to Hasluck, as a consequence lost those areas to the Member for Hasluck. As a consequence both she and I knew Charlie Gregorini well.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           His sudden passing is a terrible tragedy for this family. I extend my condolences and best wishes to his wife Sandra.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Charlie’s sudden death has been met with great sadness in the City of Swan and in Perth generally. He was a person of great integrity, and very well respected.  His contribution to public life and local government over a long period of time was very well regarded.

           <p class="italic">
            Friends and adversaries alike will recall his strong advocacy for the people of Swan and will rightly attribute a number of successes to his representation.  He served first on the Shire and then the City of Swan’s elected council since 1977, and was a long serving Mayor.

            Mike Foley were in Canberra to engage with Ministers and shadow ministers alike.  I recall that a number of our shadow ministers commented to me on the way Charlie and the City of Swan team conducted themselves.  They were well prepared, well armed with the facts and figures, and argued strongly for the people of the City of Swan.  There is no doubt that Charlie Gregorini’s leadership will long be remembered and appreciated.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            While I am confident that in the future, the City of Swan will appropriately recognise Charlie Gregorini’s contribution, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to a great
