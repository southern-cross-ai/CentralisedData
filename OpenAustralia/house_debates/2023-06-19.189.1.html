       <p>
        Calvary hospital here in Canberra is a long way from my electorate in South-East Queensland but the future of that hospital and the outrageous decision of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        government to compulsorily acquire it have triggered an avalanche of correspondence from locals in my electorate who are extremely worried about what this means for the future of private institutions across the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ACT government has announced its intention to compulsorily acquire the Catholic-run Calvary hospital and take over its operations as early as July this year. Calgary has been operating the hospital since 1979 and had 76 years left on its contract before the ACT government's sudden announcement. If a territory government can effectively nationalise a successful private institution, what is to stop them doing it to any Christian school, aged-care facility or welfare agency? If the Labor government can do this in the ACT, with the support of the Prime Minister, what's to stop them doing it in my home state of Queensland?

        emailed me to say, 'This is a clear act of religious discrimination.' Christine from Thornlands outlined in an email to me that it sets 'a dangerous and unsettling precedent for every faith based school, aged-care provider or social welfare service'. I couldn't agree more with these comments of my constituents.
