        On behalf of the government, I move a number of minor but nonetheless important parliamentary amendments to the bill. These amendments will help minimise the cost of implementation for industry and will make things simpler for consumers while ensuring strong protections for families. Firstly, we have listened to the stakeholders and agreed with the House of Representatives
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Economics recommendation that the commencement date for the obligation to provide a home loan key facts sheet be moved to 1 January next year. This will give lenders almost a full year and a half to implement this important reform from the time when this reform was first announced. We have also amended two offence penalty provisions: first, where a licensee does not have a website that allows the consumer to generate a home loan key facts sheet and, second, where a licensee enters into a contract without having supplied a credit card key facts sheet to the borrower. Persons who breach these provisions will be liable for civil and criminal penalties, and the strict liability of the provisions are considered no longer necessary. This reflects the fact that sometimes lenders may commit a foot fault with some small technical breach despite having made every effort in good faith to comply. It is important that in these circumstances there is some discretion available to provide them with relief.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next, it is proposed to amend the bill to allow consents given by consumers before 1 July 2012, when the law commences, to receive unsolicited credit limit invitations, to be relied upon. This change makes these reforms more workable for industry whilst still allowing invitations to be sent only to consumers who provide informed consent. Lastly, we have simplified the operation of the overlimit buffer reform. This amendment will make things simpler and easier to understand for consumers while preserving the strong level of protection that this critical reform provides. Lenders will also be required to notify consumers when they go over their credit limits and will not be able to charge a fee unless the consumer has given their express consent to being charged a fee. These are minor amendments but important changes to minimise the costs for industry and ensure strong protection for consumers.

         We will not oppose these amendments. These amendments represent a backdown from the government after the Treasurer sought to vilify me for having the matter referred to a committee and after he tried to spin to a journalist that we were, in fact, delaying the bill. Our concern was that the bill was starting too early. In fact, the government now recognises that with amendment (1). So I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas: that is the form of this government—it delivers a piece of legislation and consults afterwards, not before, and it seeks to ridicule and vilify any critic and then, when it realises the critic has actually got a fair point, it claims to be engaging actively with the community. So I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it does not surprise me that the Assistant Treasurer is in here doing the heavy lifting because the Treasurer himself has not got the courage to do it.

                Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker: if the Assistant Treasurer wants to be witty he would need to improve his skill base if he wants to be Prime Minister. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation; we recognise that and that is why we are not opposing it. But when it comes to some of the amendments, we are on the record as having actively encouraged some of these, and I give credit to the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Mathias Cormann, who has been actively engaged in discussion on some of these matters. So we will not be opposing these amendments, because they do represent an improvement on the substantive bill. We will have more to say about the Greens amendment a little later.

                 support the thrust of this bill and will be supporting amendments (1), (11) and (12), after they have been moved, because they are sensible technical amendments—for reasons that have been outlined—that make sense and will make it easier to implement this bill. But amendments (2) to (10) cannot be supported. It is another form of backdown. Amendments (2) to (10) remove some of the strict liability provisions and they also have the effect of removing default and supplementary buffers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is notable that the strict liability provisions were not raised once in the report of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                  Standing Committee
                 </a>
                 on Economics. The committee did not see fit to recommend any change to these provisions and one presumes that the committee thought that these provisions were important for the enforcement of some very important protections. One can only surmise what would have happened, but in the meantime lenders have come and lobbied the government and perhaps lobbied others and successfully managed to remove some of the strict liability provisions, despite the committee never having said that these provisions should be removed. In fact, the committee supported the passage of the bill as it stood.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The minister has said that the reason for the removal of the default and supplementary buffer is that it was sought by consumer groups. The committee heard that argument and the committee heard conflicting views. The committee heard from one charity that said that the default and supplementary buffer provisions that are now proposed to be removed were important and they did not believe, on balance, they should be removed and that they did not agree with the submission of the Australian Bankers Association that these ought to be removed because they said they were important protections for consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Again, what has happened is that, since the report was tabled, some lobbying has presumably gone on and the Australian Bankers Association has got its way with respect to the removal of those parts of the default and supplementary buffers that are referred to in amendments (2) to (10). For that reason, whilst we support the bill, it is disappointing that a very good, welcome and important reform is at the eleventh hour being watered down after some last-minute lobbying by the banks.

                   <p class="italic">
                    (1) Schedule 2, item 2, page 30 (lines 24 and 25), omit "credit card contracts entered into", substitute "transactions and payments made under a credit card contract whether the contract was entered into before, on or".

                   <p>
                    This bill contains some very important reforms and very important protections. A credit card is something that millions of Australians have and use every day. For many people who are struggling to make their daily obligations, it has become something that they will use with some regularity and often to supplement their income. Many would be surprised to know that some of the reforms in this bill are necessary. I think many people would have assumed that, when they make their payment on their credit card, it goes to pay off the highest amount. Many people might have presumed that there were some prohibitions on fees that could be charged when people came up to their limits on their credit cards. To the extent that those reforms are being introduced, we welcome that.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That comes in the context where banks who are the providers of many of the credit cards are doing very well, with combined annual profits of $20 billion in the last year. On fees alone—not just credit card fees but all fees—the revenue raised in Australia is in the order of $5 billion per annum. In that context, moves to limit unfair fees that banks can charge are welcome. But many might also be surprised to know that this bill will not apply to existing credit cards. Those parts of the bill that apply to access limits and the order of payments—so the payments going to pay off the highest interest-earning components—do not apply to existing credit cards.
                   </p>
                   <p>

                    </a>
                    on Economics inquiry and elsewhere, the point had been made by some of the banks said that it could not apply to existing credit cards. The
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                     National Australia Bank
                    </a>
                    did not. They made the point—correctly in our view—that, although there might be some argument about compensation on just terms if you sought to deal with the way banks apply money for existing debts, there could be no argument made under the Constitution with respect to purchases made after the date of introduction of the bill. In other words, there is no legal constitutional barrier to having the provisions of this bill apply to purchases made after the bill comes into effect. That, of course, makes sense. These are not property rights that have accrued. It is a future transaction about which there is currently no regulation.
                   </p>

                    The amendment that we are moving would have the effect, without infringing any constitutional prohibition or without exposing the government to any claims for compensation, that most Australians would think this bill would have, and that is that it would apply to all new transactions on existing credit cards. If this amendment is not passed, although there will be some great headlines about the effects of these reforms, for the millions of Australians who currently have credit cards it will mean very little difference. They will continue to pay unfair fees and when they make their payments on their credit cards it will not necessarily go to those parts that are accruing the highest debts. It is very easily fixed. The National Australia Bank agrees that it can be done, and I would urge members of this House to support these amendments because it will make a very real difference to everyday Australians.

                     ) Bill increases protections for consumers by banning over-limit fees, by making payment allocations fair and by banning unsolicited credit limit increase offers. Whilst I understand the spirit of the member for Melbourne's amendments, the government has strong advice that the amendments pose a serious exposure to taxpayers. As I am sure the member for Melbourne is aware, our Constitution prohibits the compulsory acquisition of rights other than on just terms. As lenders have accrued rights invested in existing credit card contracts, any changes to those rights may be considered a breach of that clause of the Constitution. Such a breach could result in taxpayers being required to compensate lenders in huge amounts, which I am sure is not the intention of the member for Melbourne. The government is seeking to ensure that taxpayers are not exposed to this risk. That means that we cannot support the member for Melbourne's amendment.

                      I too oppose, on behalf of the coalition, this amendment. I would say to the member for Melbourne that it is quite stark that he has no support for any of the amendments he has moved today in the House. It should be a salient lesson for him that he cannot run with the hares and the hounds in this place. He will actually have to form some partnerships, if he really does want to get something through—

                      and you cannot always rely on the Labor Party, old son. You should think about occasionally voting with us, and we might carefully consider any amendments that you are prepared to put up to the House. In this case, I would have tipped you off. But, because the element of retrospectivity is anathema to the coalition, even though it is not anathema to the Labor Party because, Lord knows,

                      could come back, we will not be supporting this amendment. Having said that, I would say to the member for Melbourne: please feel free to enter into a constructive dialogue with the coalition. After all, you do sit on this side of the House but you always vote on that side of the House.
