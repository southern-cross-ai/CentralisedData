        <i>

        . So I dedicate my 90- second statement to the Prime Ministe r's announcement to bring back k nights and d ames and in turn transform this place from '

        Since the heart beats of those opposite have bolted off the chart at the prospect of popping a peerage , I thought I would come up with some candidates. First ly , the Treasurer , who gives money to a chocolate factory to promote tourism while refusing to support the national carrier which actually flies the tourists here , is probably in line for a knighthood. The other possible nominee is the person who heads up one of the biggest portfolios in government but is rarely seenâ€”a k nighthood for the Minister for Defence perhaps . We might not have our own stealth fighters , but we sure have our o wn invisible defence minister! Next is the m ember for Wentworth . A s Minister for Communications , the soon to be named ' Earl of Wentworth ' has rolled out more gigs to consultants than he has optic fibre. But , if getting him a knighthood prompts monarchists across the country to drop into a foetal position clutching a portrait of the Queen , it will be worth it.

        Y ou may notice I haven't recommended anyone as a d ame. S ince the Afghan c abinet has more women in it than Australia's cabinet, you can appreciate the challenge co nfronting me . However , an honourable mention has to go to the Assistant Minister for Health , who has a website providing information on healthy eating which was pulled down by a former lobbyist for junk food. That has to deserve a mention .

        The final honour goes to someone who has spectacularly advanced the cause of republicanism in this country: Prime Minister Abbott. I would like to table my speech printed on the back of an
