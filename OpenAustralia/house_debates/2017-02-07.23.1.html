       <p>
        The Oaklands rail crossing issue has plagued residents in my electorate of Boothby for over 40 years. Thanks to my hard work and that of Corey Wingard MP, the state member for Mitchell, the coalition committed $40 million at the federal election to fixing the crossing. We proudly remain the only government ever to have done so. In comparison, all the incompetent Weatherill-state Labor government have done on this issue is play politics. I have had enough. Residents have had enough. Visitors to the

        have had enough. We just want Oaklands Crossing fixed. So what have the Weatherill Labor government done? They have failed to submit paperwork to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        so the project can be properly assessed. They have failed to provide updated project plans. They have failed to budget any new money for this project. Instead, they just keep claiming to have found savings from the Northern Interconnector. Given Labor's track record in my state, we will believe it when we see it. What disappoints me most is that the Weatherill Labor government are hurting my residents from Marion to Warradale and Seacliff to Sturt. Every day state Labor delays this project is another day that residents in my electorate are forced to wait in gridlocked traffic for up to 20 minutes, or sometimes more, just to travel a few hundred metres through a rail crossing.
