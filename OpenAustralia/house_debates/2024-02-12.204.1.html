        Today I rise to remember
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Manfred Cross
        </a>
        AM, who passed away on 30 January aged 94. Manfred was a true stalwart of the Labor Party, first elected to the House of Representatives in the seat of Brisbane in 1961 and then another eight times. During his time here he had a keen interest in Indigenous and foreign affairs. With great foresight, Manfred recognised the importance of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
         South Pacific
        </a>
        nations to Australia and committed to researching their needs and histories as many of them obtained independence during the 1960s.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was active in the Labor Party in Queensland, playing the role of negotiator during the party split of the 1950s, and travelled around the state attending very rowdy meetings and negotiating local deals. In the 1970s, he was a driving force in efforts to reform the Labor Party in Queensland. After being appointed as the interim Queensland branch secretary in early 1980, Manfred helped guide the reform process, modernising the party and laying the foundations for the Goss and Beattie governments. That is where I first met Manfred and his awesome wife, Barbaraâ€”at the Bardon Rainworth branch in the 1990s. Manfred was appointed a member of the Order of Australia in 1992 in recognition of his service to the Australian parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manfred is remembered as patient, modest, respectful, dignified and incredibly smart but capable of delivering stern advice. He was a voracious reader and passionate historian. He was a great mentor to me and the branch president, my good friend Tim Hansen. Manfred is survived by his wife, Barbara, his son, Ashley, his daughter, Tanya, and their family. Vale Manfred Cross.
