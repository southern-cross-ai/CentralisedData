        This government believes an effective education system is one where students come first. I recently had the pleasure of visiting schools throughout Dobell to witness firsthand how our students are receiving a quality education through the tremendous work of our principals, teachers and P&amp;Cs. As a mother, I understand the importance of engaging with students, families and the broader community to cultivate a strong learning environment which supports our students beyond the classroom.

        , teachers and student leaders. Wyong High School is a diverse school, home to 760 students and offering a range of educational pathways for students. It is important that we acknowledge the ways in which our local schools are developing educational responses to meet the diverse needs of students in our community. At Wyong High School, year 7 and 8 students are offered information technology and 'yearning for learning' classes which promote specific engagement outside the mainstream curriculum. The school has also developed a strong relationship with

        Wyong High School boasts state-of-the-art facilities, including, in addition to the aforementioned trade training centre, a primary industries facility and a commercial grade kitchen; thus allowing students to access diverse skilled employment opportunities and options. In addition to providing an array of learning options for students, Wyong High School also encourages student input into how the school operates. The student voice project recognises the importance of students' opinions about learning in their school. The project offers opportunities for students to work in partnership with school staff to plan, investigate, design and implement strategies and ideas to improve student learning and teaching practices. This program in conjunction with the various educational pathways available to students highlights the vibrant learning environment provided by Wyong High School.

        In conclusion, I would like to congratulate principal Megan Johnson, the teachers and the support staff for their dedication and leadership, which is enabling outstanding education and vocational outcomes for students at Wyong High School. I was very impressed with the students that I met that day and they are a credit to the future generation of Wyong and Dobell. Congratulations to Wyong High School.
