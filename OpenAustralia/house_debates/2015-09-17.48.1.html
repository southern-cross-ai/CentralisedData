        I rise today to speak about the success of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gambier
        </a>
        Pioneers as winners of the

         South East Australian Basketball League
        </a>
        this year. The Mount Gambier Pioneers are a much loved team in my hometown of Mount Gambier. They entered the South East Australian Basketball League in 1988 and have gone from strength to strength. Indeed they are the only sporting team from Barker competing on the national stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since turning 25 in 2013, the Pioneers have a three-peat in the South Australia
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABL" rel="nofollow">
         ABL
        </a>
        and that is no mean feat. This year they have played remarkably and the grand final was no exception. Last Saturday night, the Mount Gambier Pioneers defeated the formidable Albury-Wodonga Bandits in a nail-biting encounter. The final score stood at 87-76. The nine-point win was secured by the Pioneers through a hard-fought contest which the coach,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , said 'took them out of their comfort zone'. Richard deservedly received the

        Sport is a critical part of Australian society. It brings us together. It keeps us fit. I congratulate the Mount Gambier Pioneers on their outstanding achievement.
