        Mr Speaker under standing order 103, I have a question for you. Is it the case that on Tuesday during question time the following people were warned: the members for Sydney, Calwell, Melbourne and O’Connor? Is it the case that yesterday the members for Brisbane, Gorton, Hotham, Ballarat, Lilley, Swan, Sydney, Blaxland, Hunter and Grayndler were warned and that the members for Brisbane and Lilley were excluded from the chamber under standing order 94(a)? Is it also the case that today the members for Shortland, Fowler, Sydney, Ballarat, Swan, Hunter, Brisbane, Lilley, Grayndler, Perth, Lalor, Jagajaga, Lyons and Cowan were warned and the members for Shortland, Fowler, Sydney, Ballarat, Jagajaga and Lilley were excluded from the chamber? In addition to that, the member for Blair was also warned. That makes this week, in a three-day sitting, a total of 30 people being warned—29 on this side of the House, one on that side—and a total of eight being removed from House, all of them on this side of the House. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to page 164 of
        <i>
         House of Representatives Practice
        </i>
        , which says:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Speaker" rel="nofollow">
         The Speaker
        </a>
        must show impartiality in the Chamber above all else. A Speaker should give a completely objective interpretation of standing orders and precedents, and should give the same reprimand for the same offence whether the Member is of the Government or the Opposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, is it your view that it is an accurate reflection of the number of interjections that occur in this parliament that, of the 30 members who have been warned, 29 were on this side and one was on that side; and, of the eight people who have been removed from representation in this chamber, each and every one of them, including the Deputy Leader of the Opposition today, who was excluded after she had asked her question, when the minister opposite was chanting at her ‘you’, deliberately defying standing orders—

             Order! The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. He will not reflect on the chair. I will respond to his question as follows. All members are well aware that when disorderly conduct is noticed I call them to order. If they continue to display disorderly conduct they are warned. If members choose to ignore that warning and continue to be disorderly they will be dealt with. I will continue to uphold the standing orders fairly and as impartially as I can, as indeed all members occupying the chair have done.

              Mr Speaker, while the honourable member for Grayndler was making that point, I counted eight members of the government who interjected on him. Not once was any attention drawn to it.
