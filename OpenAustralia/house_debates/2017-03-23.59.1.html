        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on how the government is acting to responsibly manage the budget on behalf of hardworking Australians? What barriers exist to the government's policies to bring the budget back to balance?

         I thank the member for Banks for his question. I acknowledge again the excellent work he has been doing as the chair of the House Standing Committee on Economics, and particularly in ensuring that the policies that the Prime Minister and I have been working on with the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services to ensure that banks are accountable in this country and the reforms we are putting in place for banks in this country will mean that Australians will be able to get a better deal at the end of the day. I thank him and his committee for their work.

         The government is delivering on our plan to restore the budget to balance. Once again we have seen, just like we did last year, some $22 billion of budget improvement measures that we were able to implement after the election throughout the course of the back half of last year. Again, this week we have seen an omnibus bill that was designed to ensure that we could get the growth in welfare spending under control, something that taxpayer Australians desperately want to see. Eight out of 10 taxpayers go to work every day just to pay for the welfare bill in this country through their personal income tax—eight out of 10! Our bill was designed to ensure that we are going to rein in the growth in that welfare expenditure—an important task for the government. With no help from those opposite, no help from the Labor Party, who want to see taxpayers pay higher bills for welfare in this country—

           There was $6 billion worth of savings in that bill, the omnibus bill on social services, being considered in this parliament. Those opposite refused to support it. The government, through our negotiations with the crossbenchers in the upper house, in the Senate, has been able, through those measures passed and other arrangements we have been able to agree on, to see $4 billion of that $6 billion in savings realised. That is $4 billion. We were able to do that because this government just gets on with the job, despite the opposition from the Labor Party, who work against the budget being returned to surplus every single day of their existence. They are to budget management debates what a Twitter troll is to public policy in this country. They are like the pimply teenager sitting in their basement, trolling away daily, seeking to undermine and undercut the Australian taxpayer. We have been able to deliver those savings to the budget to ensure that we can pay for more-affordable child care for Australian families. It has been two years that we have been working to achieve this result, and the Labor Party has worked against working families every day and made sure that for two years they have had to pay a higher cost for child care, because the Labor Party simply refuse to understand that when you deliver services, you have to pay for them. This government has done the work to ensure that we can deliver affordable child care.

I have been looking for those surpluses. They were not there, Swany! I don't know where you left them. I looked in the cupboard. I looked everywhere but the surpluses were not there.

                     I will, Mr Speaker. I am referring to the member for Lilley, and the member for Rankin, who worked for the member for Lilley, will remember that it was the member for Lilley who supported reducing company tax. It was the member for Lilley who supported the idea of getting to surplus but was never done able to achieve it, despite declaring it had been achieved. The member for Rankin forgets that at the last election the Labor Party went to the Australian people and they said that the budget deficit should be $14 billion bigger than what the government was proposing.

                      <p>
                       So the member for Rankin, as he stood before the Australian people at the last election, said that the state of the nation's finances should be made worse. That was the policy he took to the last election. So the hypocrisy of the architect of the fiscal bonfire that they left this government to deal with would turn up with the matches still flipping out of their pockets, and the stench of the kerosene that they used to literally make the bonfire go even higher—to come here and ask this government that is restoring the budget to balance, while they sit opposite and oppose every single thing the government is seeking to do. That extends to the important work we have to do to grow our economy.
