        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House of the importance of strong border protection policies in stemming the flow of boat arrivals from Iran? Why is a consistent approach to this issue so important?

         I thank the member for Corangamite for her question, and I note her deep interest in this matter. The coalition government is resolutely committed to combating the ruthless criminal people-smuggling networks that have been the cause of many deaths at sea by overcrowding people on unseaworthy vessels heading for Australia. Under Labor's disastrous time in government, there were more than 1,200 deaths at sea—although the true scale of this tragedy is likely to be much higher, as a number of boats reportedly went missing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition government is dealing with the many legacies of Labor's failed border protection policies, under which there were around 52,000 people who tried to come to Australia via the people-smuggling trade. This includes over 13,200 Iranians, most of whom had flown to Indonesia before destroying their travel documents. Former Labor foreign minister

         said of Iranian asylum seekers: 'They are not fleeing persecution. They are seeking economic improvement.' Over 8,800 Iranians, predominantly male, remain in Australia—in detention centres or on bridging visas—with a further 660 Iranians in detention on Nauru and

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the key outcomes of my visit to Iran in April was to seek the agreement of the Iranian government to consider the return of failed Iranian asylum seekers who came to Australia under Labor's watch. I can report that a delegation of senior Iranians have visited Canberra to commence negotiations, and I am advised that the discussions were constructive.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I note that the member for

         has been grandstanding in the media yet again about our engagement with Iran. What a dishonest rant from the member for Melbourne Ports, because there is a glaring omission in his confected outrage. The member for Melbourne Ports fails to acknowledge he was part of the Labor caucus that weakened our border protection laws, and he is going to be part of a Labor caucus that would do it again if they ever got into government. Through the support of Labor members, including the member for Melbourne Ports, Labor's failed border protection policies —

           saw the floodgates open to Iranian and other people-smuggling syndicates. That is why we are engaging with Iran. We are engaging with Iran to help fix up the mess left by Labor.

             The coalition will not allow the criminal people-smuggling syndicates to determine our immigration policies. Labor cannot be trusted on border protection, Labor cannot be trusted on national security and Labor cannot be trusted to govern this country.
