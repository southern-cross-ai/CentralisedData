       <p>
        The 2013-14 budget not only continues to roll out federal Labor's Nation Building Program but begins identifying future funding priorities. This budget continues the achievements of the first phase of the program, with the final instalment of $5.7 billion in 2013-14. Already we have doubled the federal roads budget. We have increased investment in rail tenfold. We have committed more to urban public transport since 2007 than all previous governments combined since Federation. In this budget we announced more additional investment in urban public transport than any previous budget since Federation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The budget announced $24 billion for the next phase of the Nation Building Program, which commences in 2014-15, taking the total program to a record $60 billion. This is the largest capital works program in the nation's history, and the new projects announced in the budget build on this. In the budget, we provided $715 million towards the construction of the Brisbane
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_River" rel="nofollow">
         Cross River
        </a>
        Rail, and $3 billion for the Melbourne Metro. Both of these projects have been identified by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        as priority projects of national significance that are ready to proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        But these mega transport projects are on a scale that also requires private sector contributions, so we are taking a new innovative approach which is structured around an availability payment model to attract private sector investment. We are also determined to engage with the private sector when it comes to urban road infrastructure, particularly in our biggest city of Sydney. That is why we allocated $400 million to finally get the 'missing link' between the F3 and M2 to go to market within months. We brought forward $5 million into the current financial year in order to assist with taking that project to market.
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal Labor's investment in Australia's vital infrastructure extends well beyond the limits of our cities. Regional Australians are also big winners of the Nation Building Program, with almost two-thirds of all funding being invested in regional Australia. The program is funding a number of highway upgrade packages vital to our regions, such as the $4.1 billion 10-year package to upgrade and maintain the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Highway
        </a>
        . The budget also announced $500 million for a 10-year capital works program along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Midland Highway
        </a>
        in Tasmania and $307 million for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Great Northern Highway
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be very pleased with the $317 million allocated for the Warrrego Highway in Queensland. Might I add: more money than National Party ministers ever allocated to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrego_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Warrego Highway
        </a>
        in Queensland was allocated in this budget. There was $257.5 million provided for the duplication of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Princes Highway
        </a>
        West. The budget also provides $2 billion to continue important transport safety and improvement programs, including $1.8 billion over five years for network maintenance, and an additional $100 million over five years for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. In addition, the budget provided $5 million to assist the Australian shipping industry to meet its future workforce training needs as well as almost $10 million for urgent safety upgrades at remote airstrips across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal Labor understands the importance of investing in land transport infrastructure in terms of national productivity and the liveability of our cities. We have the processes right. Now, in this budget, as well as Cross River Rail and the Melbourne Metro, we funded the two managed motorways programs in Melbourne that were identified by Infrastructure Australia. That means that all 15 projects—15 out of 15—that have been identified by Infrastructure Australia have received funding by this government. We have the process right. We have put the dollars in, the investment in, to create jobs and growth, not just now but into the future.

        </small>
        <p>
         Once again we have listened to the over-the-top rhetoric of the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. We have been listening to that for quite some time. However, this is the budget where it all comes unstuck, because the reality is that, in spite of the minister's claims, this budget actually predicts a $1.2 billion cut per year for road and raid funding under their so-called nation building 2 program, which is set to commence on 1 July 2014. A $36 billion program has on the government's own figures become a $24 billion program. Once more, even that figure is probably overblown. The minister makes big announcements about things such as the Melbourne Metro link project. He talked again just now about it being a $3 billion project. What he did not say is that there is only $75 million in the next four years to actually fund it.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was boasting about WestConnex being a $1.8 billion project—although we all know the Prime Minister has put conditions on that project which make it absolutely impossible for it to ever proceed—but there is only $400 million actually provided. There is not $1.8 billion—it is only $400 million. And, since the government is insisting that there be no tolls, there is about a 75 per cent gap in the funding for a project of that nature.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality is that there will only be $2 billion spent on the entire national highway network across the country in the first year of nation building 2 program. This is just typical of Labor's approach in other areas, where they announce big programs but they are not funded—like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         , like Gonski. They announce what sound like big amounts of money, but the money is not provided. When you look at these kinds of investments, we are left with significant gaps in what is actually going to be able to be achieved. What is even more alarming is that the government seems to be manipulating the figures to make the $24 billion look as big as it is.
        </p>
        <p>
         For instance, the department confirmed in Senate estimates last week that almost $4 billion of untied local road grants for local government is included now as a subprogram in Nation Building 2. I ask the minister, is that $4 billion included in his $24 billion announcement? In the past, that money has been dealt with in other ways. But this time the department has said that this $4 billion funding, the traditional funding that goes to local government for roads, is now part of their nation-building strategy. When you look at the program and realise that $1.5 billion of that $24 billion is coming out of the Building Australia Fund—created entirely by the previous Howard government—and when you realise that there is $2 billion being transferred out of the mining tax, the real amount allocated for road funding over the next five-year program is not $24 billion; it is about $17 billion. This will be the smallest program that we have had in this nation for a very long time in real terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         The minister again talked about their $4.1 billion program for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway
         </a>
         . We have actually had candidates out there announcing projects—including a member who I notice is in the chamber—yet the funding is not profiled in any way in the budget announcement. When asked about this in Senate estimates, the minister's department said the profiles were not available yet we have got candidates announcing that these projects are going to be built while the profile for the funding is not announced.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of the $4.1 billion that the government says is committed to the Bruce Highway, $1.7 billion has been previously announced and $1.1 billion will not be available until after 2019—a lot of big numbers but, when you look at them, they do not seem to add up.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since I will only get one chance to speak in this debate—because the government always manages to talk these estimates out these days—let me talk about another issue, the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal where, quite extraordinarily, the government has announced that there are to be four new board members appointed to the terminal, but the department was unable to give the names of these members during estimates. So I am now informed that these four board members have actually attended board meetings yet their names are still a secret. The government has not announced their names yet these people are already attending board meetings. This seems to be remarkable. At the department's own estimates just a few days ago, they were unable to name those people.

              The shadow minister made some extraordinary statements during that contribution. One was that the Building Australia Fund was somehow a creation of the Howard government. It was created through legislation moved by me as the minister as part of the creation of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Infrastructure Australia
              </a>
              . It is a part of the infrastructure Australia setup, something that they never did. They never set up a process and indeed they opposed the Infrastructure Australian legislation. It is complete nonsense from those opposite.

             <p>
              He went on to pretend that programs that are under construction with real money creating real jobs, creating real improvements in infrastructure do not exist. He should go to Rockhampton, have a look at the Yeppen roundabout, have a look at the duplication of the bridges that are under construction right now. It is not an apparition; it is real. It exists. There is steel and concrete, and there are workers and cranes working right now on the

              This shadow minister was once the minister and he described the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway as the worst section of road in Australia. He was the transport minister, it is in his electorate and he did nothing about it. Well, we have for one section of it. We promised it, funded it, built it and opened it. He did not play a role in any of those activities. I say to the shadow minister that next week I will be turning a sod on construction in his electorate. Come along—Cooroy to Curra section A, funded by us. Come along.

                You might not. You are so hopeless that you might not know that the state government—the Newman government—and your mate
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Seeney" rel="nofollow">

                organise the invites. So ring up Jeff. Get yourself on the list. He might not know you exist. The state government will be looking after the sod-turning on Cooroy to Curra next Wednesday. Come along. He can say that that is not real as well, because he has gone out there and said—even when we fund projects in his own electorate—that it is not happening. Well, drive on the road. You can, because one section of it is open and the next section of construction we are funding, brought forward into this financial year, will commence construction.
               </p>
               <p>
                Then he went on to criticise the funding that we have provided for all of these programs, including the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal. The Moorebank Intermodal Terminal is absolutely vital for Sydney's infrastructure, ensuring that we take 3,300 trucks off the road every day. You know what the opposition did?

                You see, it is really not that complex. You have a port and then you have the city of Sydney, and then you have an intermodal terminal. Here is what an intermodal does—and maybe the member for Hughes can think about this, because he has campaigned against it. His own party are supporting it, but he has campaigned against it, showing how disingenuous and unfair they are. The state government support it. Your opposition support it, because it will take trucks off the road, because you have freight moving onto rail. It is not that complex: trucks off the road, freight onto rail, rather than going through all of the streets, including in the electorate of Hughes, in order to get to its destination. The freight infrastructure investment that we have done will take nine hours off the journey on the East West Link and seven hours off the journey from Melbourne to Brisbane. Let me tell you: what he does not say is that the land and the site were chosen by the Howard government. They chose the site. Since then the coalition campaigned against it at the last election and now they are for it again. If he is fair dinkum, he will say at the next election campaign that they are actually for this vital project. We issued a release with all of the board members on the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal, as we do with all board appointments.

                             No-one has the call at the moment, Member for Capricornia. It would also assist, in the limited hours that are available in these portfolios, if the members asked the question and the minister responded in more of a summing-up way. I think that would be useful and would allow more questions to be asked of the minister. But I am only suggesting that, not directing that. The question is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to. I call the member for Capricornia.

                              region. I was just thinking that we are not even 20 minutes into this consideration in detail and I have already lost track of the number of projects that the minister has talked about and the amount of funding that is in discussion here this morning.

                              I think back to consideration in detail in the nine years I spent in opposition when I would come in and be part of listening to the minister's counterpart in the Howard years, and I cannot really imagine what he would have talked about. But I know what I would have been talking about: I would have been talking about what was not happening on the
                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
                               Bruce Highway

                              and what was needed in terms of this very important piece of infrastructure for the state of Queensland and indeed the entire nation.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              We have heard many times from this government, and we speak about it with great pride and conviction, that since coming to power the Labor government has spent four times as much—the minister will correct me if I get this wrong—on the Bruce Highway in half the time compared to the entire spend in the time of the Howard government. That is a great figure to quote but what does it really mean when we talk about that level of investment in this very important highway? I can tell the House, and constituents of Capricornia could tell the House, that it means basically constant nonstop roadworks setting about greatly improving the Bruce Highway both north and south of Rockhampton. Go south of Gladstone and you get to the Calliope crossroads, an enormous project underway there. In the northern part of my electorate there is the southern access to Mackay, which is an extremely busy and important section of road which really doubles as the Bruce Highway but also a very vital connection between the community of Sarina and the industrial area of
                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay_Point" rel="nofollow">

                              , the massive coal terminal, and Paget to the south of Mackay. We have duplicated that southern access to Mackay. It was done within a couple of years of us taking government. Work improving that section of the highway continues with further overtaking lanes between Sarina and Mackay.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Very important is the project the minister has already referred to, and you just have to laugh when the shadow minister talks about, 'They have announced this and what does it mean.' The minister has invited the shadow minister to please come to Rockhampton, although if the shadow minister comes to Rockhampton it could get very embarrassing, because so far we have had the shadow Treasurer and the opposition leader twice come to Rockhampton and fail to make a commitment, refuse to make a commitment for this extremely important project for the people of Central Queensland. This project is fixing up the Yeppen floodplains, finding a solution to this section of the Bruce Highway which we know from very painful experience in 2011 and before that in 1991 can be cut in times of flood, which cuts off Rockhampton and the entire northern half of the state for weeks at a time, causing huge disruption to our local economy, huge disruption to very important businesses right around Central Queensland and beyond. So there is work going on right now on the duplication and lifting of the Yeppen Bridge, and that is going to include very important improvements to the congestion for people having to travel in and out from Gracemere every day, something that is very important to our local area.

                              What comes next is what is required to really boost the flood immunity of that stretch of road. I would like the minister to talk a little more about what is in the budget for the Yeppoon South project. Even more than that, because there is so much to talk about in terms of Bruce Highway improvements, I would like the minister to talk about the Bruce Highway funding package in the budget.

                               We will shortly begin the upgrade of the Pumicestone Road interchange, part of a $195 million contribution from the federal government. Over the next year, in 2013-14, we will have the Cooroy to Curra section A construction commencing with the sod turned next week; the duplication of the highway just south of Townsville between Vantassel Street and Cluden; the construction of the new interchange and replacing the existing intersections between Roy's Road and Bells Creek Road, part of a $195 million contribution; and construction of the final section of the

                               I will give Labor a pat on the back and say they have spent more in their four or five years on the Bruce highway than we did before.

                               That is what local members who are rational say about our contribution to the Bruce Highway. There has been a total funding commitment of $5.7 billion since we came to office compared with the former government's $1.3 billion. Even those arithmetically challenged should recognise 5.7 is a lot more than 1.3. It is not just a figure though because what that means is that there are real jobs as a result of the contributions that have been made.

                               It compares favourably across the board because we heard before the shadow minister dismiss the $24-billion figure that we have announced already for Nation Building 2. I have no doubt there is more to come in future budgets as state governments and territory governments submit properly funded projects. He said that is a terrible figure. The former government's big trumpet under

                               was $11.4 billion. The shadow minister says it was more than that. Maybe they got it wrong because they are not real good with numbers. But $11.4 billion was the headline in their press release for Australia's roads and railways. That was their contribution. Twenty-four is more than 11 and—that is moving forward as we receive further projects.

                               What we know is that investment in infrastructure produces a return in productivity, a return that leads to higher growth, a return that leads therefore to higher revenues and a return that produces outcomes in economic growth and jobs. It is the driver of our national economy. We can invest in two things: physical capital and human capital. That is why we regard infrastructure and skills of the two parts—investing in people through education and training, and investing in nation-building infrastructure.

I would like to take the minister to his opening comments where he referred to the future funding priorities in his budget. In particular I want to refer to the

                                The minister is well aware of both my concerns and the concerns of the member for Eden-Monaro about the state of the Princes Highway. Without wishing to be political on the issue, I think the highway between Sydney and Sale has probably been neglected and ignored by governments of both political persuasions. In fact, some parts of that highway are in a deplorable state. I do acknowledge that some work has been undertaken in the Eden-Monaro area, the Bega bypass and other areas under The National Road Network as an off-network project.

                                My particular interest, Minister, relates to the duplication project, which has been jointly funded between Traralgon and Sale, with $140 million from the federal government and $35 million from the state. The minister would be aware that the current funding for this project is set to expire with the completion of the stage between Stammers Road and Minniedale Road. I think the minister would be aware of that. There is concern within the community, within Latrobe City Council,

                                and the general public about whether future funding opportunities exist for that duplication work. I understand that the cost of the project is in the order of $500 million and that $175 million has been allocated to it. So I would be interested to know: where does the Princes Highway East, Traralgon to Sale, fit in the government's future funding priorities?

                                The second question I would like to ask the minister relates to an issue he may well be able to clarify for me—and that is, the $20 million reprofiling that occurred, due to the

                               <p>
                                Perhaps more generally—and I invite the minister's comments on this particular issue—in terms of road-funding activities across Australia, I am particularly concerned about the amount of the road budget that is being redirected into issues relating to things such as the
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">

                                . The way in which we have been forced to move roads out of road reserves because of EPBC Act intervention, I think, is a concern for this government and future governments.

                                From my understanding of the EPBC Act, it was really meant to relate to issues of national significance, yet we are seeing local highway duplication projects being moved out of the road reserve onto private property at significant expense to the Commonwealth and the relevant state governments. I would invite the minister's comments: how significant an issue is this for our nation? How much road money allocated to the transport department is being diverted into these environmental issues, which are sometimes quite spurious? I would invite your comments on that, Minister.

                                 Labor has done substantially more than the former government did. That is not hard, because they did not put a cent into this section of the highway. There is more to be done. The current process for Nation Building Program 2 is that we have asked all of the state and territory governments to make submissions as to their funding priorities on the road and rail networks. I sat down on a number of occasions with the Victorian government, the Victorian minister, and worked out some initial priorities in terms of the major projects for Nation Building Program 2 that the Victorian government wanted. Part of that was the Melbourne Metro project that, in Minister Mulder's own words, is the No. 1 priority for Victoria. We worked out funding for that project—$3 billion from each level of government plus an availability payment model, as I said in my opening remarks—but the Victorian government appear to be stepping away from that. I must say we have had difficulties getting any cost-benefit analysis from the Victorian government for road projects such as the east-west tunnel. Their proposals talk about it beginning in the east, and there is a question about what the appropriate model is. I certainly believe in funding both road and rail projects, but it is beyond me why the Victorian government are refusing to submit this cost-benefit analysis or any business plan to the federal government, my department or to

But I say to the member that I would be happy to continue to work with him in a constructive way on Nation Building Program 2. We indicated very publicly, on budget night—the shadow minister seems to be surprised by this—that these are instalments for specific projects that we have included in the program.

                                 I am a minister who argues for additional funding for infrastructure. The former government seemed to have transport ministers who just rolled over for the Liberal Party partners and did not seem to actually be able to win an argument in their party room, in the cabinet or wherever. There was a distinct lack of funding. Indeed, the last time the coalition were in office they cut $2 billion from road funding in their first budget, and their budgets never recovered from those cuts.

                                  The question is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to. Given that there are a lot of members who want to ask questions, for the convenience of the House, if members on my right could ask questions seriatim and then not speak for so long, you will get your questions in and the minister can respond. Members on my left, I take it that the Leader of the Nationals and the honourable member for Dawson are going to ask questions? Okay. I will lead off with the member for Gellibrand.

                                   I will ask a very brief question in order to enable my colleagues to raise some of their issues, because the minister has touched briefly on the issue that I wanted to ask him about, which is for him to address further this question of infrastructure, particularly in the western suburbs of Melbourne. The lack of funding for roads by the coalition is true not just if you look at spending from our government compared with the previous, Howard government but also if you look at the last 20 or 30 years: the big infrastructure projects were funded by Labor governments.

                                   Minister Albanese, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the latest investment in the

                                   , the western suburbs of Melbourne being one of the fastest growing communities in the country; and how they complement our investments in regional rail and the latest investments in the Melbourne Metro. I, perhaps cheekily, put on the record that, if the east-west tunnel—as others persist in calling it—is to go ahead, I would like to call it the west-east tunnel! I do believe, given where the particular population pressures are, that, if it were to go ahead, consideration should be given to building it from the western end rather than the eastern end. That has a long way to travel, as the minister mentioned, when work has not already been done by the state government—and you might want to address that too, Minister. But I understand my colleague is going to ask you some questions to handle together.

                                     I take this opportunity to ask the minister some questions in relation to expenditure on transport and infrastructure in the budget appropriations. There have been some great investments in Tasmania under this Labor government—about $1.9 billion. That has been great for lifting the infrastructure which is so urgently needed and for creating great jobs. The electorate of Lyons is 50 per cent of the state of Tasmania and has most of the great highway between the south and the north. I am often referred to as 'the honest broker in the middle' and it is a title I enjoy wearing. The minister might like to outline the $500 million announced in the latest package for work on the

                                     and also the Launceston bypass. Planning for the new Bridgewater bridge is continuing. There is the upgrading of the

                                     and St. Peters Pass, one of the oldest passes in Tasmania. There is quite a bit of activity around Mona Vale—I see there is a cherry farm in that area—and between Mangalore and Bagdad. In the north towards Launceston, just past my electorate office in Perth the highway is being duplicated and upgraded between Perth and the Launceston airport roundabout. They are urgently needed upgrades, which have been put aside for too long.

                                     When you come to Tasmania you can see much work going on in infrastructure, with all the water pipes for the Midlands Irrigation Scheme sitting beside the highway. Down in the Colebrook sportsground you can see the rail sleepers for the upgrading of the rail at Rhyndaston and there are plenty of bulldozers. With the great work done on the Brighton bypass, that town is now in the biggest growth area in Tasmania. So Minister, I ask you how you see those areas and that infrastructure coming together with the $1.9 million this government has put into infrastructure in Tasmania.

                                      I thank members for their questions. Firstly, the member for Gellibrand is very conscious of the federal government's investment of $13.5 billion into Victorian infrastructure. That is a shift from $89 per head to more than $200 per Victorian. So we have more than doubled the infrastructure budget for Victoria. Concerning specific projects, we are currently investing more than $3.2 billion in the regional rail link, including through the member's electorate. Right now, there are 3,500 Australians working directly on that project as a result of that investment. Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat and Melbourne are all benefitting. It is a very exciting project, one I have visited on a number of occasions and one which I note the federal Leader of the Opposition did not even know existed—an extraordinary proposition—when he said on Melbourne radio that the federal government does not invest in any urban rail projects, except for the

                                      The M80 has also been an absolutely critical project. We have committed some $900 million to the upgrade of the Western and the Metropolitan ring-roads. In this budget, we have added a further $525 million for that project, which is absolutely vital for the efficiency of the Victorian road system. It is an absolutely vital project for Melbourne. The important thing about the east-west—

We are not pretending that we will be able to duplicate the whole highway. The opposition pluck figures from nowhere. It is bit like the construction of the

In 2004, they said the costing was $382 million. By 2007, they said it was $1.2 billion. They just make up these figures as they go along. They hold out false hope and pretend that they can build things with an amount that they simply cannot. We have invested real dollars into real projects that are making a real difference in terms of costing. The whole duplication has been costed at $2.7 billion. That is more than $400 million. Those opposite need to stop the sort of nonsense that they go on with. We have invested real money in those real projects.

                                       Deputy Speaker, I have three issues to put to the minister. The first is in relation to the upgrade of the
                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">

                                       from Vantassel Street in Townsville to the
                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Highway" rel="nofollow">

                                       </a>
                                       . The minister would know of it: $110 million was announced in the budget for this project. It was certainly something that the government was going to remove altogether to pay for the flood reconstruction in Queensland, and only after campaigning by the Liberal-National coalition was it reinstated in the budget. That was a good outcome. I have written to the minister, and I believe that the

                                       has written to the minister—and perhaps the minister has also received correspondence from the Townsville Turf Club—about some issues that the community have with the upgrade of that road. I am just wondering whether the minister is aware of that and what the minister is going to do about those concerns.

                                      <p>
                                       The second issue I refer to concerns the Bruce Highway. The minister and, I believe, the Prime Minister came to Rockhampton to announce a supposed $4.1 billion Bruce Highway package. We later found out that roughly $1.76 billion of that was already announced funding. This leaves around $2.4 billion to be spent over the next 10 years.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       The

                                       in Queensland has a Bruce Highway action plan where they say that $6 billion over the next 10 years is needed for the highest priority projects on that highway. The $2.4 billion that you have allocated over the next 10 years is not even half of what is needed. The minister will probably respond that all of that $1.76 billion was announced after the Bruce Highway action plan came into effect, but that answer will only really fly if the $1.76 billion in funding that has already been committed out of that $4.1 billion is for projects that are actually contained within the Bruce Highway action plan. So my second question to the ministry is whether he can assure me and indeed the House that out of that $4.1 billion that has been allocated, including the $1.76 billion that has already been allocated, all of it is going to projects that are identified in the Bruce Highway action plan. The following question is, if there cannot be an assurance there, what projects are we going to miss out on? Will the Haughton River Bridge be something we miss out on, the upgrade of Sandy Gully near Bowen, the planning for Beganga Plains in the Whitsundays be something we miss out on?

                                       In relation to the ring road, there was a visit by the Prime Minister on 24 April to Mackay and she announced that the ring road would be funded by the government. There were no details but she told reporters that in the budget the ring road would be included. We have got the budget before us and there is no line item mentioning the ring road whatsoever. There is no mention of the ring road in the budget. There have been indications made to journalists by the Prime Minister, by the minister and indeed by the Labor candidate in the electorate of Dawson that the ring road funding will be available in the 2013-14 financial year. I want a clear answer from the minister, a yes or a no: will the ring road funding be made available in the 2013-14 financial year?

We have released, now, for community consultation, the proposed route. That is out there. As to the community consultation, that funding has already been provided under Nation Building 1.

                                              And you have not promised a zack, a cent, of funding for the Bruce Highway, but you come in here and get critical about funding for your electorate! You are one of the only members of parliament I have ever seen in the entire time I have been here, 17 years, who have complained about funding being in your electorate. You have campaigned against it, and you need to do your job.

It means that vehicles can go from the south, head north via the M7 and M2 and on to what has been the missing link. It is a vital project. We sat down constructively with the

They have only put $5 million into the next section of the Ipswich motorway and they failed to put any funding at all into the

They plan to rip the seats out of the existing trains and make people stand on the train so they can squeeze more people in. I am sure they will have an employment project just like you see in Tokyo whereby people with gloves will be charged with pushing people, cramming them like sardines, on to the trains.

It took the current federal Labor government, largely due to the campaign by the member for Petrie over and over again, to make this into a reality. It has begun but I am very concerned that the project is under threat because of the statements on the record from the coalition, which is they do not believe in any investment in public transport. To quote the Leader of the Opposition, they should 'stick to their knitting', which consists of minor road funding in marginal electorates. It was what the record was previously. There should be no funding.

They have made it very clear that is their position. We know in spite of the fact that there are so many people on the record, including the

So the 2013-14 budget charts a pathway to return to balance in 2015-16 and to surplus by 2016-17, improving the sustainability of Australia's public finances and building on Australia's record of fiscal and economic strength. The priorities of the budget are providing schoolchildren with the opportunities to reach their full potential, with $9.8 billion invested in new school funding; providing support for people with severe and permanent disability through the historic $14.3 billion investment in DisabilityCare Australia; and providing critical infrastructure, as we heard in the previous portfolio's consideration in detail, with $24 billion of new investment in road and rail.

The budget continues the government's record of identifying strategic savings rather than making savage cuts.

I understand this is the parliamentary secretary's first attempt at a consideration-in-detail stage of portfolio expenditure, but he should confine his remarks to the budget papers, as I understand it. Talking about the opposition, telling fibs about the opposition, does not relate to the budget papers for the forward estimates—

The government has chosen a sensible path of consolidation, maintaining strong growth and low unemployment while ensuring that Australia's debt levels are among the lowest in the developed world. Through these investments in the National Plan for School Improvement, DisabilityCare Australia, the National Health Reform Agreement and aged care, the government is ensuring that Australia is a stronger and more socially cohesive nation.

                                                               The coalition thinks that all Australians deserve the best opportunity at the life they wish to pursue. That is why we have announced a series of policies as part of our real solutions plan, to ensure people have those opportunities over the coming months. Where we find a little inconsistency is when the government has this so-called Social Inclusion Unit but seeks publicly to denigrate Australians it does not agree with. I refer in this respect to the terrific and remarkable contribution last week by the member for Batman in his speech to the parliament announcing his retirement, in which he made the point: 'We should be about creating opportunities for all Australians, not pursuing our pointless class rhetoric.'
                                                              </p>

                                                               How does a minister justify having a Social Inclusion Unit at the same time as the Treasurer of the country seeks to pursue, it would seem daily, this class warfare rhetoric in the parliament and outside by targeting Australians because of their success? How is that consistent with establishing this so-called Social Inclusion Unit and, in so doing, spending millions of dollars? Equally, Minister, can you outline to the parliament how much funding has been allocated to the Social Inclusion Unit over the forward estimates? How much of that funding has been allocated to the board as well as to the unit itself? How many people are currently employed within the Social Inclusion Unit? And what is the total expenditure so far in 2012-13 for this unit?

                                                                The government, since we came to power in 2007-08, thought it was important to have a social inclusion approach to government. I will talk a bit about the precise focus of that agenda, because I am not sure the member for Mayo has completely understood the idea of the social inclusion agenda, at least from our government's perspective.
                                                               </p>

                                                                Social inclusion, essentially, is about a fair go for all Australians. But taking particular account of the fact that, in spite of our extraordinary economic success over the periods of the Hawke government, the Keating government, the Howard government and our government since 2007, 21 years of uninterrupted economic growth which, as the parliamentary secretary eloquently said, has been the envy of the advanced economies around the world, that rising tide has simply not lifted all ships. We know through research that there remain around 600,000 adults in Australia who experience multiple points of disadvantage, by which I mean that it is not just that they are experiencing poverty or it is not just that they are experiencing disability or it is not just that they are experiencing unstable housing or perhaps homelessness. It is that they are experiencing a whole range of those disadvantages.

                                                                Agenda recognises two things: 1) that any country worth its salt needs to continue to focus on ensuring that, in our case, those Australians have the opportunity enjoyed by all others to participate in this country's success; and 2) that some of the traditional approaches to dealing with disadvantage are simply not working for that group. By that I mean that traditionally what we have done for someone experiencing poverty is to give them an income support program. What we have done for someone experiencing mental illness or disability is to give them some mental health support, and what we have done for someone experiencing housing issues is to give them housing support. Where people are dealing with multiple points of disadvantage we recognise there is an obligation on government and delivery agencies funded by government to work more in a joined-up way so that rather than those Australians having to go forum shopping with eight or 10 different agencies, they are given an approach that is centred upon them rather than centred upon different government agencies or different

In my area of mental health, the Partners in Recovery program, which seeks to support some of the most chronically and seriously unwell in our community, is deliberately a joined-up program that seeks to bring together often eight or 10 different agencies that are providing support to these 60,000 or so Australians and ensure that the agencies work through one centralised support program rather than expecting those Australians and their families or carers to go shopping time and time again for different supports from different agencies.

Be very clear, our agenda on social inclusion is focused on those Australians experiencing the most intractable disadvantage. We receive very good advice and support from the Social Inclusion Board.

We know through those research pieces that these are the surest paths into intractable disadvantage, but we also understand that the surest path out of that disadvantage is training and employment. I appreciate the advice we have received from the Social Inclusion Board. I will take on notice the particular questions about the dollars that the member for Mayo has asked me and I thank him again for his interest in this very important policy agenda.

It is an area that will benefit enormously from the government's contribution in the area of social inclusion. I particularly thank him for meeting with a number of young people on the issue of mental health and the need for mental health resources in a very poor and isolated area. The report on Wyong Shire has shown just how people in that area have missed out. The concept of social inclusion is very important. It is not playing one group against another; it is making sure that everybody in our society has an opportunity.

We all just need to look at our electorates to see how successful it has been. We express our thanks to the government, at least on this side of the House. A key part of that reform package was to establish a new mental health commission, to bring better transparency and to report on performance to our mental health service and in our entire mental health system. The budget continues the government support for funding of the National

I was particularly struck by some of the arguments made by young people, their parents, their teachers, their high school principals and, in some cases, their grandparents about the particular social circumstances of that part of the Shortland electorate. There are relatively speaking low rates of car ownership impacting on someone's capacity to drive to Gosford or to Newcastle. The relatively low rates of internet connection restrains a young person's ability to tap into our investments in e-headspace and other mental health initiatives. That for me was a very powerful discussion and again I thank you for that.

I want to place on record that the idea of mental health reform and the need to improve mental health services has happily been a bipartisan idea for several years. We differ sometimes on the details of that effort, but I am very pleased that, from the community's point of view, that is seen as a bipartisan obligation on all governments—Commonwealth or state.
                                                                 </p>

They wanted an agency at arm's length from government that would report without fear or favour on the performance of our mental health services. We have reported now for more than 20 years in this country in minute detail the number of beds we have in the mental health system, the number of staff we have in the system, but we have not been good at reporting on outcomes. We have not been good at reporting on the degree to which those investments through taxpayer dollars change people's lives and help them recover from their illness, help them connect back with their families and communities, back to work, back into stable housing and so on.
                                                                 </p>

They have done it marvellously well in their first year. The report card that they released just before Christmas put a spotlight—I think for the first time—on the extraordinary physical health disadvantage that, particularly, people with severe mental illness experience. Their life expectancy gap—the gap between their life expectancy and the average—is almost 30 years. The only other group in the Australian community that experiences a similar life expectancy gap is

I thank him for that. It has been. The shadow minister for health has pursued these issues with vigour in the last few years, and the Leader of the Opposition also. I also acknowledge the minister's commitment. In my own electorate he has met with groups and attempted to solve some of the challenges that I think there are, particularly in regional mental health issues. You would know yourself, Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin, that they are a different set of issues and are very hard to fix. I know the minister has put some attention on that, and we appreciate that. I am not sure we have yet got it right, so it is an issue which we need to continue to focus on.

Some of the machinery aspects of government which I think are important have been downplayed by ministers in this place this week, but I think they are substantially important to the operations of an effective executive government. During the Howard years, of which I had some experience as a staff member, there was a focus on ensuring the proper process was always followed—certainly from the Prime Minister, who very much respected the office that he held and the processes and traditions of that office. What has become apparent this week in estimates and in questioning in this place is that it seems that there are a series of ministers, through the chaos and dysfunction of the events of March this year, who have not received their charter letter from the Prime Minister.
                                                                  </p>
                                                                  <p>
                                                                   For those unfamiliar with it, a charter letter is the letter which in effect is a job description for the minister. It outlines what it is the minister is responsible for, acts and the expectations of the minister. In the Howard years, the Prime Minister would have a session with each minister every 12 months to go through the charter letter and work through whether the outcomes that he expected to be achieved in the portfolio area to further the government's agenda were indeed being achieved. It was a very important letter for internally holding ministers to account to ensure that the aims and the pursuit of the policy direction of the government—which is usually announced at the beginning of a term in the Governor-General's speech—were being achieved.
                                                                  </p>

There was no charter letter. It was then revealed in the portfolio of the minister for social and community services, Minister Macklin, that she does not have a charter letter. I presume the minister for mental health and other issues has a charter letter.
                                                                  </p>

How many ministers have not received their charter letter? Will they get the charter letter prior to the government entering into its caretaker period, which is about 78 days away? Have the Prime Minister and her department drafted those letters yet? Is this stuck in the in-tray? Do they intend to put some urgency to it? Can the parliamentary secretary update us on these matters?

This was an issue raised about when the Prime Minister was going to send charter letters to her ministers who have not received them. Talking about the opposition's plans to live within our means and to ensure that we have got a Public Service which is operating efficiently—and this instance shows quite clearly that it is not—has not got anything to do with the question I asked.

We recognise the great reforming work that public servants do. That is why we are committed to a strong Public Service. That is why this side of parliament will never resort to the sorts of attacks upon public servants that we see from members of the opposition, which are so regrettable because of the great work that is done by public servants to build a stronger and more cohesive nation.

                                                                        I have a couple of questions for the minister on the not-for-profit reform agenda. I spent a number of years—in fact a couple of decades—of my life working in the not-for-profit sector and have extraordinary regard for the people that work in it, largely from firsthand experience. I got into it as a piano player—a repetiteur in the opera company, coaching singers in their roles—in my early 20s, and I spent the next nearly three decades in it before going into business on my own. It is filled with people who can start with a blank piece of paper and can identify some of the most extraordinarily large problems and chip away at them, on the smell of an oily rag. If you want to see efficiency, look at the not-for-profit sector. They achieve the most extraordinary things with very little money quite often.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        But one of the things you also notice when you work in that sector is the amount of time you spend applying to government and, particularly, reporting to government. If you are a large organisation, you might apply for funding across six states and territories plus to the Commonwealth government and local councils, and you might apply to several departments in each of those places. So it is not unusual when you are reporting to have to provide anywhere from three to six copies of annual reports even three years back. In my office we had a shelf of annual reports each year for the last three years, a shelf of constitutions and a shelf of folders that contained things like certificates of cooperation. Several times a year you would send not an envelope off to a government department but a box of stuff.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        When applying for grants there is also the need to continually establish your bona fides. There is an incredible amount of repetitive red tape to supply to different bodies and different levels of government. I was really pleased to see the work done by the Labor government in reducing that red tape. It started to rationalise how the not-for-profit sector relates to government, particularly with its exchange of information. I know that incredible work has been done, but I would really like an update on the progress of that reform agenda and the recent achievements in reducing red tape and simplifying Commonwealth grants programs for those who apply for them.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        The second matter for me is the issue of gags. Between the years of 2004 and 2007 when I was representing Parramatta in opposition I saw first-hand some of the ramifications of the Howard government's gag clauses. In fact, I went to a forum in this house run by one of the members of the now opposition called 'Participatory democracy: a threat to democracy'. The forum was actually about a view that people in the not-for-profit sector who are representing a community but are not elected by the people are a corruption in democracy. It was actually quite scary. It was filled with Liberal members. I was the only one in the room who was not a Liberal member. I saw the impact of that view in my community when we had organisations representing some of the most vulnerable people in the community who did not feel that they had the right to speak on their behalf. It is my view, and I know it is the government's view, that a good government should be brave enough to feed the hand that bites it. It is the job of the not-for-profit sector to identify problems as they emerge at the coalface, make those well known and speak very, very loudly for those who are not able to speak for themselves.

I know that the Labor government abolished Howard's gag clauses as one of its first actions in 2008. I would just like the minister to advise the chamber on recent announcements on the gag clauses both from the Commonwealth and from other governments and to inform the House about the impact of those announcements on the freedom of the not-for-profit sector to advocate for policy reform on behalf of some of the most vulnerable people in the community.

We have a very strong and firm view that not-for-profit reform is one of the outstanding pieces of microeconomic reform. By 'outstanding' I mean that it is one of those pieces of microeconomic reform that is still to be done. In many respects the ACNC reforms, and a number of other reforms associated with them, mirror the reforms that the Hawke government drove in the late 1980s, in the corporations sector, to do away with the myriad of reporting obligations that corporations back then had to comply with at Commonwealth and state levels.

It is responsible for, or employs, about eight per cent of Australia's workforce. It engages about five million, or five-sixths, of the entire Australian volunteer workforce.

I think we have a very important obligation, regardless of the political flavour of the party in government at the time, to ensure that we are a good purchaser of services from these

I am wondering whether, at this stage, given the government has announced its review, it has worked through the details of what the department's commitment on assisting this review will be, to ensure that the full facts are revealed about why this convicted Islamic terrorist was put into the Inverbrackie facility, which the department of immigration knew, and no action was taken to move that person until this was made public. Given the revelations the minister for immigration made in this place during the week—that the minister was not advised, and then subsequently updated the parliament that the previous minister was advised—obviously the Prime Minister’s department will play an important role in bringing all of this together as a cross-portfolio function. Can the parliamentary secretary tell us, in the short time remaining, how much work has gone into preparing for the inquiry that was announced yesterday and how many resources will be allocated to it?

                                                                           </a>

The independent Inspector- General of Intelligence and Security will focus attention on making sure that information is shared appropriately. But I would reinforce the point that the Prime Minister made in the House yesterday—that the individual in question was in detention at all times. That is an important factor for all members of the House to be aware of.
                                                                          </p>

It has, I think, been disappointing to see the opposition opposing the independent investigation by the Inspector-General, who has legal authority to conduct such an inquiry, and instead calling for an inquiry by a parliamentary committee that does not have authority to have such an inquiry. It is disappointing and it does speak, I think, to the opposition's willingness to use the important issue of national security as a political football.
