        <i>
         the Universal Postal Union

        . The report focuses on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' inquiries into the two major treaty actions relating to the acts of Universal Postal Union and also covers two minor treaty actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Universal Postal Union is a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        specialised agency and the postal sector's primary forum for international cooperation. That's why the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPU" rel="nofollow">
         UPU
        </a>
        sets the rules and standards for the exchange of international mail between member states, with its mission being to develop efficient and accessible universal postal services. It's not hard to understand that a set of agreed postal rules and practices is essential to a workable system of sending and receiving mail around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee considered two treaty actions. The first focuses on changes to the UPU constitution and the second on changes to the composition and functioning of the councils of the UPU, including Pacific island representation, changes to contribution classes under the agreements and a permanent postal payment agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the declining use of letters and increased volume of parcels, in addition to the fact that the majority of parcels are now being handled by operators outside the UPU system, the UPU has sensibly initiated work to open itself up to wider postal sector players and to modernise the institution in order to deliver better outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other key issues raised during our inquiry include Australia's role within the governance of the UPU, which has always been constructive, the cost of national distribution, the interests of Pacific islands, national sovereignty and gender equality principles.
       </p>
       <p>
        One particularly welcome aspect of the UPU amendment process was Australia's collaboration with our Pacific friends. The committee heard that the government and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Post
        </a>
        , in partnership with Pacific postal administrations through the Pacific Postal Development Partnership, work together to deliver improved systems, processes, technology and training across the Pacific based on locally identified needs and drawing, of course, on Australia's considerable expertise. The first such partnership activities provided equipment and associated training to postal operators in Fiji,

        </a>
        , Tonga, Vanuatu and Nauru.
       </p>
       <p>
        The minor treaty actions in this report include the 2023 amendments to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annex_I" rel="nofollow">
         Annex I
        </a>
        of the International Convention against Doping in Sport, which lists substances and methods that are prohibited in sport. The second minor treaty action, amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, inserts a new chapter into the convention aiming to improve the safety for industrial personnel voyaging to an Australian offshore facility from overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee supports the two Universal Postal Union treaty actions and the minor treaty agreements or amendments covered in this inquiry report and recommends that binding treaty action be taken. On behalf of the committee, I commend this report to the House.

        <p>
         by leave—I wish to make a short but meaningful statement in connection with the report. It's extremely important that the postal system operates seamlessly internationally. When you send a letter or parcel from Australia overseas, you should have assurance that the postal system in the receiving country will get it where it needs to be. At its core, enabling the process and cooperation between countries is what the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Postal_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Universal Postal Union
         </a>
         is about, setting rules and standards for the exchange of international mail between member states, of which there are 192. It's why Australia has taken a leading role in engaging with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPU" rel="nofollow">
          UPU
         </a>
         seriously over a long period of time. The treaty action in question ensures our ongoing commitment with the UPU, clarifies our obligations and removes ambiguity.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think what's most important to highlight is the role we have in supporting Pacific island countries. Pacific island countries now have a permanent seat on the UPU council. Often, these nations can find it difficult to have their voices heard, particularly due to the expense of attendance and the fees associated with being a part of the union. It is good that pathways are being created to allow small island developing nations to manage debts and flexibility to rejoin. The committee heard that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Post
         </a>
         has an important relationship with Pacific island states, sharing meeting reports and outcomes, and working with them to ensure they can advocate for their interests. We also heard about the importance of the Pacific Postal Development Partnership in helping deliver improved systems, processes, technology and training. This is a tangible way we can make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do note the significant amount of time it took for the treaty action to come before the committee, with some of these changes coming into effect as early as 2018. I want to thank the secretariat, the chair and all the committee members for their hard work. I commend the report to the House.
