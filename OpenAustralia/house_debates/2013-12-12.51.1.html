        This petition of certain citizens of Australia
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Draws to the attention of the House to the fact that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPC_Ardmona" rel="nofollow">
         SPC Ardmona
        </a>
        can no longer compete with very low cost imported preserved fruit and tomatoes. This is forcing growers and the industry to abandon orchards and retrench workers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to ensure the relevant ministers impose a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         World Trade Organisation
        </a>
        consistent Emergency Safeguard Measure which will make imported preserved fruit and tomatoes compete on a more level playing field.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We also urgently request support of an industry survival package to give the growers and related workers a future.
       </p>
       <p>
        from 5,317 citizens
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have already presented thousands of previous signatures on the issue of SPC Ardmona's threatened demise in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulburn_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Goulburn Valley
        </a>
        . This is the last standing fruit manufacturing business in the country. It is an icon business, it employs some 900 people directly and thousands more in the orchards growing fruit, in the transport sector and in the cool store sector. This industry was nearly killed off under the previous regime of Labor with high costs. The very high dollar did not help.
       </p>
       <p>
        These petitioners are begging that this House support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" rel="nofollow">
         World Trade Organization
        </a>
        emergency safeguard measures which will be made known on 20 December. The petition also begs this House to understand the severity of the problem and for support from the federal government when it requests technological investment, hopefully supported by the state as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        These petitions have been through the appropriate committee and, as I say, there are 5,317 signatures from the men, women and children of the Goulburn Valley. They are people who are either directly dependent on the fruit growing and manufacturing sector in my area or who simply want to see an Australian food growing enterprise continue into the future. They do not want to have to depend on imported food. They want SPC Ardmona to thrive and grow.
