        My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister just advised the parliament to listen to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        , does the Prime Minister consider the AFP is wrong when it says that resourcing shortages left the AFP unable to properly investigate a 1.6 tonne cocaine importation? When will the Prime Minister finally stop blaming everybody else and take some responsibility for the decisions that his government makes when it comes to the AFP?

         The Labor Party's commitment to the rule of law would be taken somewhat more seriously if they weren't wholly owned and beholden to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         . Let's have a look. It's very important when we look at corporate structures to see who the shareholders are. That's where the money comes from: the CFMEU.
        </p>
        <p>
         As at eight days ago, on 16 October, there were 84 CFMEU representatives before the courts, facing a total of 896 alleged breaches of the law.

            The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The member for Isaacs will resume his seat. I've been listening carefully to the Prime Minister, and I have said many times he's entitled to a preamble, and he is on the policy topic, but the question was about the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
             AFP
            </a>
            . I have allowed a very long preamble. In fact, we're a little more than halfway through the allotted three minutes. I ask the Prime Minister, in the remainder of his answer, to bring himself to the question that was asked.

            <p>
             Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I said earlier and as the minister has said, we gave record funding to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
              AFP
             </a>
             in the last budget. We provide them with the resources they need to keep us safe. Speaking for myself and, of course, for the minister, the Attorney-General and other ministers, we are in the closest contact with the AFP. I value the advice of the AFP Commissioner, Andrew Colvin. I spend a lot of time with him and I take his advice very carefully. He knows that, when he needs the support of my government to keep Australians safe, he can always count on that support.
