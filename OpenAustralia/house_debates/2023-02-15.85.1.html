         Order! The member for Bruce will state that question without any other extra things in the question, with the minister's full title and no comment at the end.

            <p>
             I thank the member for Bruce for his question. I know that he has been a strong advocate for more social and affordable housing in his own electorate, both as a member in this place and also previously in local government. Indeed, the Albanese government was elected with a plan to help tackle the country's housing challenges—challenges that have not appeared overnight but have been there in the economy for some time. Indeed, in relation to our plan to establish a $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, we have legislation in the parliament to actually establish it—the single biggest investment in social and affordable housing by a federal government in more than a decade. We want to get on and deliver this package of legislation.
            </p>
            <p>
             But before we introduced our legislation, of course, we consulted. We consulted experts, practitioners, academics, local councils, states and territories. We did the work to make sure we got it right. And the feedback is this fund is welcome and it is needed. Indeed, the Kate Colvin, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
              CEO
             </a>
             of Homelessness Australia, has said, '
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
              Can I
             </a>
             start by saying how important the fund is as a new mechanism to provide resources for social and affordable housing?' Mike Zorbas, from the Property Council, said the legislation 'is an important first step to get government working together with industry to bridge the national housing deficit and stimulate new supply that Australia desperately needs'. National Shelter has said, 'We cannot afford to have the Housing Australia Future Fund fail.'
            </p>
            <p>
             Importantly, our plans are achievable. Indeed, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Housing_and_Urban_Research_Institute" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute
             </a>
             said, 'What the government is doing is setting ambitious targets'—and they are ambitious targets, but they're also achievable targets. The $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will make a real difference to people's lives. Of course, the member for Bass, on the other side, has acknowledged this. Most people on that side want to vote no to most social and affordable housing. But the member Bass said: 'As the government, you are expected to solve these issues, and I'm not going to get in the way.' I acknowledge the member for Bass for saying that, as I acknowledge members of the crossbench, who have been participating in the debate. They of course want more social and affordable housing in their electorates. But I say to those opposite who are not supporting this fund: how are you going to talk to the public in your electorate who want more social and affordable housing? To those people that need homes in your electorate, to people who are on the public housing list in your electorate, what are you going to say—that you came in here and you voted no to more social and affordable housing for those that need it most.
