        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government makes substantial investments in infrastructure across the nation including in transport infrastructure, through the Infrastructure Investment Program; in communications infrastructure, through the

         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        and mobile connectivity; in energy infrastructure, by supporting rebuilding the electricity grid; and in water infrastructure, to build essential water supplies across Australia. Good investment in infrastructure creates significant opportunities by creating jobs, building communities and unlocking economic growth and productivity.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        was established by the current Prime Minister in the last Labor government to provide independent, expert advice to the Australian government on infrastructure investment that Australians need. Since then, Infrastructure Australia has been sidelined with a lack of genuine influence. It's been stretched too far and too thin and has lacked focus. These amendments ensure that Infrastructure Australia is the adviser to the Australian government and that it is evaluating proposals submitted by the Australian government, states and territories.
       </p>
       <p>
        The infrastructure environment has also changed significantly since its establishment, which is why this government commissioned an independent review to identify the changes needed to restore Infrastructure Australia and to refocus its priorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill responds to the recommendations of the independent review of Infrastructure Australia that was conducted by Nicole Lockwood and Mike Mrdak AO.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government's response to the review recommendations will position Infrastructure Australia to achieve its core purposeâ€”to provide quality, independent advice to the Australian government on infrastructure that supports the economy, builds the nation and addresses the challenges and opportunities of the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill makes important changes to the Infrastructure Australia Act to provide the framework for implementing the government's response to the review's recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill's amendments will provide for greater alignment between Infrastructure Australia's work program and the advice that government needs to make informed infrastructure investment decisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government intends to clearly set out its infrastructure policy objectives, which will inform Infrastructure Australia in carrying out that work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Infrastructure Australia's focus will continue to be on transport, water, energy, and communications infrastructure, the nationally-significant infrastructure that connects our cities and our regions, and is an enabler of our economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Infrastructure Australia will be strengthened as an adviser on project merits and priorities, and will deliver a more refined and targeted infrastructure priority list linked to its audit, government priorities and Australian needs. These changes will remove duplication and build on the strong relationships with the jurisdictions, harmonising processes and leading to better targeted advice to appropriately inform Australian government decision-making.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, Infrastructure Australia will retain its statutory independence, which will ensure it continues to provide impartial advice to the Australian government, particularly on infrastructure project selection and on prioritisation, for investment in projects where it matters the most.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new governance model put forward for Infrastructure Australia, will ensure it has the eminence, authority and standing to be a national leader and coordinator amongst infrastructure advisory bodies. The three commissioners will collectively have strong and relevant expertise and be responsible for the delivery of Infrastructure Australia's functions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government expects the commissioners will be engaged in delivering the work of Infrastructure Australia, rather than being merely an oversight body. Persons appointed to the commissioner roles will have been identified through a merit-based process and will be highly experienced members of the infrastructure sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Infrastructure Australia is now providing advice on infrastructure proposals through the budget process and will support the slimmed-down governance structure with an advisory council consisting of infrastructure experts and Commonwealth agency senior officials.
       </p>
       <p>
        The advisory council will provide strategic advice to the commissioners and help improve Infrastructure Australia's interactions with government investment and decision-making processes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst the bill implements the recommendations of the independent review of Infrastructure Australia requiring legislative changes, a new Statement of Expectations will be issued to Infrastructure Australia to implement the remaining recommendations of the review.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together, these changes will set Infrastructure Australia up to once again be the Commonwealth's expert adviser on infrastructure of national significance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
