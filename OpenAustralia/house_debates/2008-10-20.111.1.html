       <p>
        I had the pleasure on Friday last week to be involved in the celebration of the completion of the Ellis Brook Valley Development Project. The celebration was held in Honeyeater Hollow, a beautiful and peaceful area that reminded me how important it is not only to preserve our bushland but also to share the experience as widely as possible. I am fortunate, as are the other residents of Perth, to have such a stunning area so close to the city and, of course, within my electorate of Hasluck.

        and the Friends of Ellis Brook Valley to improve the facilities at Ellis Brook Valley. There are now extra composting toilets, shelter structures, seating and barbeques as well as excellent signage and improved trails. Importantly, many of these trails are accessible paths that allow people with disabilities to enjoy the natural beauty of the area.

        I would particularly like to acknowledge the hard work done by the Friends of Ellis Brook Valley—I do not know anywhere else where we can attract such large numbers of volunteers as we do to our bushcare areas—the wonderful crew at the City of Gosnells, particularly those outdoor workers who work in the natural resource areas and parks, and the local Australian technical college students who constructed some of the barbeques. The infrastructure that has been provided by this project will encourage more visitors and locals to enjoy this unique area. But not only that: the work has been done in a way to ensure the environment and habitat are protected, and I congratulate everyone involved with this project.
