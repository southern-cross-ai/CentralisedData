        I rise today to congratulate the Warrnambool Racing Club on the fantastic success of its May Racing Carnival. It was a three-day event. Over 27,000 people attended.

        was up 20 per cent. It was a fantastic event for Warrnambool and south-west Victoria, bringing millions of dollars to the region. In particular I congratulate Des Roberts, the Chairman of the Warrnambool Racing Club, for the fantastic job he has done since taking over the presidency of the club. This was his first May Racing Carnival as chairman and it was an outstanding success. I congratulate Des for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Des asked me whether I would present whips to the winning jockeys of the three major jumps races on each day of the carnival—an offer which I took up and was honoured to do. I thank Des for making that suggestion. It was a great privilege for me to be able to be part of the three days of the carnival by presenting those whips to the winning jockeys.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this time to thank

        . John has done a fantastic job since he has been at the Warrnambool Racing Club, and I think the three days of racing in early May were a tribute to John's professionalism in his role as CEO.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take a moment to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Napthine" rel="nofollow">
         Denis Napthine
        </a>
        as the state's Minister for Racing. Denis understands the importance of the May Racing Carnival. He understands the importance of jumps racing to Victoria, and he has done a fantastic job putting confidence and prize money back in the industry and also investing to make sure the safety requirements are there. As a result, we saw three days of racing both on the flat and on the jumps which were second to none.
       </p>
       <p>
        For me one of the particular highlights of the three days was when a horse that I have a small share in saluted in the third race of the final day over 2,000 metres. Well done to Wells. I take this time to thank those people with whom I am involved in that horse:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_McGregor" rel="nofollow">

        , an old university friend; Alan; Andrew;

         Martin Kavanagh
        </a>
        ; Nic Rule; and Geof Cain. It was terrific to see Wells salute and terrific to be involved, especially with my good friends who are in the horse with me. I also take the opportunity to acknowledge Martin Kavanagh's wife, Laura, for her kind hospitality during the carnival.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is incredibly important to regional and rural Australia that towns can put on events whether they be sporting events or musical events, which bring people to them. By attracting people into the regions, we bring in revenue. It brings people to the restaurants. It brings people to the retail stores. It puts towns on the map. People go back and visit those towns. The Warrnambool Racing Club acknowledge this and promote it. They have someone who promotes the carnival. It is very interesting, as you go around and talk to people—especially those who have travelled from interstate or from Melbourne—and how they say: 'It's fantastic to come down to Warrnambool for the three days of racing. But it's also fantastic because it leads us to come back with our families and spend some time during the summer or during the school holidays.' The importance of these events to the economies of regional and rural Australia cannot be underestimated.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion I would once again like to congratulate the Warrnambool Racing Club on three wonderful days of entertainment that they put on. I am sure that every one of the 27,000 people who went along on those three days all had a fantastic time and that everyone is looking forward with anticipation to going along again next year.
