        (1) A worker performs work for a constitutionally-covered business for the purposes of a minimum entitlements order, if:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the worker performs work directly or indirectly for the constitutionally-covered business; or
       </p>

        (b) the worker performs work directly for another entity, and the constitutionally-covered business carries on a business of arranging for workers, including the worker, to perform work for that other entity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Without limiting paragraph (1) (a), a worker indirectly performs work for a constitutionally-covered business if the work benefits the constitutionally-covered business, irrespective of the legal relationship (contractual or otherwise) between the worker and the constitutionally-covered business.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) If, because of the operation of subsection (1), a worker performs the same work for 2 or more constitutionally-covered businesses, the FWC may specify any or all of those constitutionally-covered businesses for the worker in a minimum entitlements order that applies to the worker.

       <p class="italic">
        789FBC Effect of a minimum entitlements order
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) If the FWC makes a minimum entitlements order, the provisions, modern award or enterprise agreement specified in the order apply to work performed by a worker to whom the order applies for a constitutionally-covered business required to comply with the order in relation to that work, as if:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) any reference to an employee (within the ordinary meaning of that expression), or a national system employee, also included a reference to the worker; and

       <p class="italic">
        Example: If a minimum entitlements order specifies a modern award, the award applies to the worker, in relation to work performed for the constitutionally-covered business, as if the worker were an employee. The obligation to comply with the modern award is in section 45 (in Part 2-1).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       <p>
        This bill should be opposed. This bill should be opposed outright because it's a bill that will let job insecurity spread like wildfire across the country. That's why I and the Greens voted against it for the second reading and will vote against it in the Senate as well. This bill just needs to be stopped
       </p>
       <p>
        If we are going to pass an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
         IR
        </a>
        bill in this place then what we should do is pass an IR bill that outlaws insecure work. That what these amendments would do. These amendments would not just outlaw insecure work but they would put in place a framework that means we can give equal rights to all workers in this country. I especially want to draw attention to those parts of the amendments which are found in amendment (3). There has been, rightly, across this country, attention focused on the fact that because some people are called contractors and some people work in different work arrangements they get paid less than the minimum wage and they get no sick pay or annual leave. It's been said by some on the government side that this is too difficult to fix because it's too complex an issue. Instead of moving the bill which the government proposes, which would entrench inequality in the workplace, these amendments will get rid of it by putting all workers on an equal footing. I want to speak about this, because it shows that it can be done. It is not too complicated to do; it can be done.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments introduce a legislative presumption that all workers, whether or not they're classified as employees, should get the minimum conditions as if they were employees. That's the presumption. Under these amendments, it is then left up to the Fair Work Commission to decide, sector by sector, employer by employer, how to extend those employee-like entitlements to the workers without changing their employment status. That way, for anyone who's an Uber driver, a contract worker or in any other form of employment, if the Fair Work Commission says you should be entitled to at least the minimum conditions as though you were an employee, then you get them.
       </p>
       <p>
        This should be unobjectionable, and it deals with one of the government's fundamental points that it has raised at every question time so far—that is, it's too difficult to impose a blanket rule. Well, let's do what has been in the Greens bill, which was presented in this place several years ago and which today I'm moving as an amendment to completely replace the government's bill—not add to it, because the government's bill is unsalvageable, but replace it. Let's put in place a system that says everyone is entitled to get at least minimum conditions, and it is up to the Fair Work Commission to decide how that operates for individual employers or in individual industries. This will allow the Fair Work Commission to say, for example, 'Uber, Deliveroo, or whatever service you're working for, have got to pay you the equivalent of the minimum wage as though you are an employee, so you're no worse off.' It's effectively a no-worse-off test if the commission chooses to implement it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The point of moving these amendments is to say, firstly, the government's bill should be rejected; secondly, we should be tackling insecure work and the fact that so many people work for less than the minimum wage and don't get wages and conditions; and, thirdly, it's not too complicated. There is a fix. Change the law, introduce a new presumption and then ask the Fair Work Commission to roll it out on an industry-by-industry or sector-by-sector basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the government continues to maintain that it is too tough to give workers in this country the minimum wage and minimum conditions, well there's an answer. It has been before the parliament for several years in the form of the Greens bill, and I'm moving it here as a replacement for the government's bill. Because, instead of entrenching insecure work and allowing it to spread like wildfire, we should be outlawing insecure work and we should be putting all workers on an equal footing with regard to the minimum. If this amendment passes and replaces the government's bill, then what we could say is that no-one will fall below the basic minimums in this country. No-one will get less if they're an employee, and it will be up to the Fair Work Commission to work out how that is applied on an industry-by-industry or a sector-by-sector basis. I say to the government: there is an answer. The answer is the Greens bill. Get rid of your own bill, replace it with this, and we will start to stamp out insecure work and put all workers on an equal footing.

       <p>
        In one final matter, this is just to indicate that the member for Clark has asked me to note, for the record, that he also supports these amendments.

          I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and—by leave—I move government amendments (1) to (5) together:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (1) Clause 2, page 2 (table items 5 to 9), omit the table items, substitute:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (2) Schedule 3, heading to Division 1, page 43 (line 2), omit the heading.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (3) Schedule 3, items 17 to 23, page 43 (line 4) to page 44 (line 10), omit the items.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (4) Schedule 3, Division 2, page 46 (lines 5 to 20), omit the Division.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (5) Schedule 7, item 1, page 102 (lines 19 to 22), omit subclause 50(4).
         </p>
         <p>
          These amendments will remove measures in the bill that were to effect a change to section 189 of the Fair Work Act 2009. That section is the existing exceptional circumstances provision, which was included in the Fair Work Act by Labor in 2009. It already enables the Fair Work Commission to approve enterprise agreements that do not pass the better off overall test in exceptional circumstances. The bill before the parliament today originally adapted this existing provision to take account of the exceptional circumstances that some businesses have suffered because of COVID-19. It provided that the Fair Work Commission might approve enterprise agreements that did not pass the

           BOOT
          </a>
          where it was satisfied that it was appropriate to do so, taking into account all of the circumstances, including the extent of employee support for the agreement, the impact on the business of the COVID-19 pandemic, and safeguards, which were not explicitly mentioned in the current law under Labor's existing exemption. The removal of that exemption is based on the fact that, having gone through rounds of consultation with the crossbench, the government considers, having listened to the crossbench—particularly to statements made by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
           One Nation
          </a>
          senators to us—that the best prospect for the pragmatic, sensible reforms in the overwhelming part of this bill to be moved through the Senate was to remove this modest exemption to section 189, which is what these amendments achieve.

           We support the amendments that are being moved by the government, but it does need to be noted that the government is now moving an amendment to a section of the bill that the government has spent two months claiming wasn't there. When the bill was introduced—that day—we made clear that this section constituted a pay cut. That day, and in every question time that followed, we made clear that the impact of removing the better off overall test was that workers would no longer be guaranteed to be better off. It's not complex—it's a little bit obvious—but, every time we raised this, we had two responses from the government. The first was to say, 'That's not true.' If it's not true, it does beg the question of why we're now having an amendment to remove that section. And the second thing that was raised was to say, 'Well, that clause is already in the bill.' If it's already in the bill, then why is there an amendment? An amendment, by definition, does something different. If you're not doing something different, it's not an amendment. You can't stand up and move that the legislation remain as it is and introduce a bill that does that. That's not an amendment to a bill.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet we have spent two months in the strangest of arguments, where there's a real issue out there for Australian workers, where we had legislation before the parliament that, if implemented, was going to allow a situation where their base rate of pay could not be changed but where every single penalty rate, every shift allowance and every overtime rate could be gone, and the normal protection to prevent that from happening would already have been taken away from them. That's what we had for the whole of summer. I would remind the government that, the day after they introduced this bill, we moved a suspension of standing orders to have the bill removed because of this provision, and the government voted against that. The government voted that they needed to keep this clause here, and they moved between the two arguments that I've referred to. But there was a third argument that came up from time to time, and it was advanced not by the Leader of the House but by the Prime Minister. When he got caught in the corner from time to time by the fact that this is clearly what the legislation was designed to do, he then defended it on the basis that that's the way to create jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
           At its core, I think this is the debate that we're in. We're about to find ourselves, in the coming months, in a period—we don't know how fast—of some form of recovery. That's where we all want to be. All the indicators are that that's where the economy will be heading, and that is good. But, on the pathway of that recovery, there are two different views as to how you get there. One view is that you give business as much money as possible, and that means they will simply invest across the economy and all will be well. The other view is that you need to give workers the capacity to spend. The economy is going to be more dependent on domestic demand than it has been at any other time in our lifetimes. If people don't have the confidence to spend, the next few years, on the other side of this pandemic, are not going to look nearly as good as they should.
          </p>
          <p>
           This bill in the form it's in right now, where the amendment has not yet been carried, creates a real danger that people won't have that confidence, because you don't have the confidence to spend if you don't have the confidence that your take-home pay will be retained. It's not simply keeping your take-home pay at the current rate or better; it's knowing that you're not going to be subject to future cuts that gives you the confidence to spend rather than to hoard and save because you're in fear of what might be coming next.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, in this debate, we've been at the core not simply of the old-style debate of trying to get a better deal for Labor versus capital; we've actually been in something very specific to the other side of this pandemic. If people have the confidence to spend, the recovery is going to be that much better. But, if the approach is to attack wages, to attack superannuation and to attack the payment system, that won't only hit the recipients of those payments—

            <p>
             The impact of that won't only be to the recipient of the wages or the entitlements; the hit will be to the Australian economy across the board. I would urge the government: it's a really silly debate to be in. This is not the only element of the bill that depresses wages. There are a series of elements of this bill that weaken bargaining power or provide for circumstances where people who currently, as part-timers, receive overtime will no longer be able to receive it or where very modest pay rises, such as $1 a year, can be locked into agreements for a period of eight years. These sorts of challenges are still in the bill. So I simply say to the government: you're a bit late getting there, in that we offered to get to this point the day after the bill was introduced, but we're there. But, if the government's intention is to have a bill that no longer cuts wages, they're not there yet. We support this amendment, but this bill still needs a tremendous amount of work, and it is not yet a bill that we could support.
