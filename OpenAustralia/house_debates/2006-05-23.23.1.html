        My question is to the Treasurer and

        . Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the

        </a>
        confirmed to an estimates committee yesterday that 19 companies are seeking sponsorship approval from the Commonwealth government to import foreign apprentices? Is the Acting Prime Minister also aware that another three companies have already been approved to import foreign apprentices, one of which is a group training company that has been approved to bring in 50 apprentices? Acting Prime Minister, in which regional areas are these apprenticeship visas likely to be issued? What is the current youth unemployment rate in these regions?

         The skill training visas system was developed in response to representation from regional industries—and that is why it was developed—many of whom had difficulty filling apprenticeship vacancies. Before an overseas apprentice can fill a vacancy, an approved regional certifying body must certify that no Australian apprentice can be found to fill the vacancy and draw on documentary evidence that must be provided by the potential sponsor. All regional certifying bodies are endorsed by relevant state and government bodies, and in some states the certifying body is the state government. For example, in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , it is the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         state department that is the certifying body, and I am led to believe that in nearly all the states the state governments reserve unto themselves to be certifying bodies. Those certifying bodies must certify that no Australian apprentice can be found. I do not believe there is any evidence whatsoever that the regional certifying bodies have done that falsely and I doubt whether the opposition would say that they are doing it falsely, because they are in fact state governments and bodies—

            South Australia

           government? No. She does not accept the Victorian government? She does; she is nodding. My goodness! Perhaps the member for Throsby will advise a vote against the New South Wales Labor government at the next election and a vote against the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
            South Australian

           Labor government at the next election. From our point of view, they are regional certifying bodies.

           make this point: no position can be filled by a foreign apprentice unless there is certification and documentary evidence that a local apprentice cannot be found. That means that they will not be taking positions from local apprentices, the numbers of which have massively increased under this government.
