        In July this year the Launceston motorcycle company braaap launched its latest model, the Moto3, which will see it competing in Australia's largest motorcycle categoryâ€”the learner-approved sports bike market. The company also celebrated its 10th Anniversary. In the last decade, braaap has enjoyed local and international success in the children's dirt bike and superlite dirt bike categories. Last year, it introduced a full-size cafe racer model called the Mercury and now has two road bikes in its range. It had a 400 per cent growth in unit sales during the past year. It employs 32 staff and is in the process of recruiting more. Last year, the motorcycles it produced outsold similar models from major international manufacturers.

Brad Smith and his company, braaap, are fantastic examples of a young entrepreneur and a young company achieving international success that bring significant benefits to my community of Northern Tasmania.
