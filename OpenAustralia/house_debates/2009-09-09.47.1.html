        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery. What action is the government taking to improve men’s health in Australia?

         I thank the member for Brisbane for his question and note the importance with which the government takes the issue of men’s health and the actions we are taking. I note also, and it is particularly relevant today, that this evening the Treasurer will be launching awareness month for prostate cancer. It is that issue on which I want to address members of the parliament today. We take men’s health very seriously. Prostate cancer is an important issue for every man in Australia. The

          It is a question of definition of middle age. I can tell you that you all fit it. Some of you don’t, young lady. What we need to know is that, for a man in his 40s, there is a one-in-a-thousand chance of a diagnosis of prostate cancer; for a man in his 50s—and there are plenty in this place—12 in a thousand; for a man in his 60s, 45 in a thousand; for a man in his 70s, 80 in a thousand. Each year in Australia close to 3,000 men die of prostate cancer. That is equal to the number of women who die from breast cancer annually. Around 18,700 cases are diagnosed in Australia every year. Every day about 32 men receive the news that they have prostate cancer. Tragically, one man every three hours will lose his battle against this insidious disease. One in nine men in Australia will develop prostate cancer during their lifetime. Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government takes this issue very seriously. We have provided $15 million over five years to establish two dedicated prostate cancer research centres, the first of their kind in Australia. One is located at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epworth_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
           Epworth Hospital
          </a>
          in Richmond and the other at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Alexandra_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

          in Brisbane, hosted by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_University" rel="nofollow">
           Queensland University
          </a>
          of Technology. These centres will conduct research to develop improved diagnostic tests, screening tools and treatments. Research programs are already underway at these two sites: $10.8 million has been provided in 2009 for 45 grants dealing specifically with prostate cancer through the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
           National Health
          </a>
          and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
           Medical Research Council
          </a>
          and $2.5 million has also been provided to fund a range of organisations through the Building Cancer Support Network grants. A further $2.6 million will be provided until 2012. Andrology Australia will also receive $1.2 million to support its focus on the prevention of men’s sexual and reproductive health issues, including prostate cancer.
         </p>
         <p>
          The important thing, though, is that all Australian men need to take responsibility for their own health.

           All Australian

          men, and particularly those of us in middle and later middle age, need to have a regular health check, which includes a check for prostate cancer. I confirmed with my good friend Dr Washer that this would mean a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSA" rel="nofollow">
