        Volunteers are the unsung heroes in every community, and my electorate of Longman is no different. They give up their time, much of it on weekends or during the night hours. They turn up regardless of the weather, all because they care about our community. That's why it was a pleasure to acknowledge many of the volunteers in Longman when I recently hosted the Longman Volunteer Recognition Awards. The awards, in the main, were handed out to well-deserving individuals, but today I want to give a shout-out to an organisation who was a recipient of one of these awards.

        The Caboolture Snakes Junior Rugby League Club would not survive without the 140 volunteers who turn up every week during footy season. These mums, dads and other community minded citizens ensure our budding champions have all they need to enjoy the game they love. The coaches, managers, sports trainers, jersey washers and canteen staff all play their part in this huge club, which has well over 500 registered players. The number of players has grown enormously this year, and it is a testament to the volunteers and the excellent culture the club has developed. This growth has the

        investigating ways in which to enlarge the facilities to accommodate the recent and future growth. So today I want to say thank you to all the wonderful volunteers at the Caboolture Snakes Junior Rugby League Club. Go the Snakes!
