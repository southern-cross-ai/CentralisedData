       <p>
        A few weeks ago I paid a visit to the 18th Company Wanneroo of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_Brigade" rel="nofollow">
         Boys Brigade
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . I attended their midyear awards. I would like to thank the volunteers who run this great organisation. The Boys Brigade in Western Australia has been successfully undertaking youth work programs since 1895, when the first company started at the Wesley Church in Perth. The Boys Brigade is a Christian organisation, delivering programs that focus on training and developing boys and young men into balanced people through physical, spiritual, social and educational activities. The Boys Brigade, in particular the 18th Wanneroo Company, is an extremely positive organisation. The Boys Brigade develops an awareness of community and the need to make a contribution to that community. The Boys Brigade state president in Western Australia is Ray Speers. He is also the company captain of the 18th Wanneroo Company. The other volunteers at the 18th company are Alan and Nicky Roper,

        and Kim van Keule, together with section leaders Claude-Francois Sookloll, his brother Pascal Sookloll, and Maria Price, who also administers the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_Brigade" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Western Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also would like to thank the company chaplain, Darrell Thatcher, for all his good work with the 18th Wanneroo Company. I take this opportunity not only to endorse the great work of the Boys Brigade, and of course the Girls Brigade, in Western Australia but to pay particular tribute to the volunteers who undertake this great work. These days, where it seems that an increasing number of people vigorously pursue their rights and are only interested in what society owes them, it is reassuring to know that there are others out there who see their volunteer work as fulfilling a responsibility to the community. Whether it be a great organisation such as the Boys Brigade and service clubs or whether it be in the coaching or the administering of volunteer sport or parents groups at schools, they are the people who keep this country going. I have spoken about volunteers before in this place and I will do so again in the future. But this morning I say thank you to the Boys Brigade in Western Australia. To Ray Speers and his team of the 18th company: what you do is very positive; I ask you to keep it up, and we will end up having a stronger and safer community through your efforts.
