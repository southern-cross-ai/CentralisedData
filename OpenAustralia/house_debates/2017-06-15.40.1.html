       <p>
        As the House would be well aware, and of course you, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, in our electorates it is the show circuit time. In regional Queensland seats the show circuit is alive and well. Recently in my electorate we had the Boonah Showâ€”its 109th year. I want to congratulate the entire committee of the Boonah Show Society, led by the able
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harvey" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Harvey
        </a>
        . Jim has his name associated with the president, but the real work is done by his good wife, Marg, and I acknowledge her for her contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, you better than most would understand that in small regional communities the president of the show society will also often take on a role in the Lions den, or the Rotary club or the Menshed. These are extremely hardworking people. I want to acknowledge them and just give a quick overview of how successful the show was this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to be the celebrity judge for the cook-off this year. A man of my 'attributes' was amply capable of being a judge of the stir-fry, with the prize going to Jim, who is an excellent cook in his own right. Queensland Miss Showgirl Kaitlyn Schultz and Queensland Rural Ambassador Justin Matthews both participated. It was an excellent show and I encourage all members to get their constituents out into the local show circuit.
