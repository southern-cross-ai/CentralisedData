       <p>
        The past few months have created unprecedented challenges for our country, and as we begin to take the first tentative steps back towards normal life we should be thankful for the strength shown by our civic institutions and the sense of duty and dedication displayed by Australians from all walks of life. I would like in particular to single out several organisations and individuals in my own electorate of Wentworth for special thanks and appreciation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Organisations such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Big_Kitchen" rel="nofollow">
         Our Big Kitchen
        </a>
        and the Coalition of the Ageing have worked tirelessly to ensure that the elderly and vulnerable have had access to quality meals without having to leave the house. Similarly, Holdsworth Community Centre and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayside_Chapel" rel="nofollow">
         Wayside Chapel
        </a>
        have been there for Australians most in need. These organisations have had their own challenges to deal with, including the requirements of social distancing and other health precautions and at times a shortage of volunteers, but they have got through admirably with the generosity and selflessness of dozens of volunteers helping to make their operations work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the positive role played by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waverley_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Waverley Council
        </a>
        and in particular the mayor, Paula Masselos, the general manager, Ross McLeod, all councillors and the entire council staff. They have successfully helped steer the community through a difficult time and in particular have found ways to creatively allow the local community to access the ocean whilst protecting public health through their 'surf and go' and 'swim and go' programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the leadership shown by Woollahra council and in particular Mayor Susan Wynne, the general manager,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_James" rel="nofollow">
         Gary James
        </a>
        , and all councillors and council staff. The council have again found creative ways to ensure people can enjoy the outdoors and harbour but without compromising public health interests through their 'swim and go' program. They have also introduced a range of measures valued at $5 million to help ease the impact of COVID-19 on local small businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Public transport workers, including the bus, ferry and train drivers in my own electorate, have kept our city moving in the strangest circumstances. Our police force have been adapting rapidly to frequently changing restrictions and bearing the brunt of any public backlash. They have behaved with admirable professionalism and courtesy. Our supermarket staff have turned into everyday heroes, working around the clock to keep shelves stocked while adapting to the coronavirus threat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the difficulties being suffered by many small businesses in my electorate and applaud them for the ingenuity and resilience they have shown in adapting to this new world. Coffee shops, restaurants, gyms, beauty salons and many other businesses have suffered significantly through this crisis. But many have found ways to adapt their business models to keep their staff on and to keep serving their customers and clients.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coronavirus challenge is not over, but my faith in our ability to come out of this stronger is drawn from the strength of everyday Australians and their ability to rise to the occasion. I say thank you to the people of Wentworth for your patience, your cooperation and your diligence in getting us through this crisis.
