       <p>
        I rise today in this place to call for a royal commission into the government's robodebt scandal. I do so because of the number of people in my electorate who were impacted by this diabolical system. It was sending out 20,000 notices a week at its height and had real impacts and unfair impacts on people's lives. I sat with a resident locally who had finished university and qualified as a teacher. She was unable to find work in that first six months, which is not unusual, and was therefore getting support. This young person went on to find a permanent job in January. Years later, in her recess time, she was desperately trying to get on to Centrelink to talk about the debt they had issued to herâ€”cramming it into her day. She was triggered, because she'd had a tough year mentally that year being unemployment benefits and trying to find work. She'd had an incredibly tough year. She had just purchased a house. She had a mortgage. And now she had a Dun &amp; Bradstreet letter to say that she owed thousands and thousands of dollars. We know now that this was unlawful. This was intolerable, and we should have a royal commission to hear every story.
