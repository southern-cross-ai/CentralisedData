       <p>
        Recently I visited the Marine Discovery Centre in my electorate of Hindmarsh in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        with the education minister, Senator Simon Birmingham, and his young daughter Amelia. I have been working with the Marine Discovery Centre for some time and I am impressed by their commitment to educate children about the importance of our marine environment. It is the only remaining centre of its kind in South Australia where primary school children can have a real hands-on experience and interact with displays. The education minister and I were lucky enough to be taken on a tour by Ruby, Macy, Edward and Alex from the local Star of the Sea School. I thank them for all they taught and showed us during the hour we were with them. I would like to congratulate the Marine Discovery Centre director, Tim Hoile, and the Star of the Sea School for their support and dedication. Another organisation supporting the centre is the Henley Beach Parish, so well done to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate and recognise the dedicated volunteers who have kept the centre running for almost 20 years. Importantly, the federal government currently provides the centre with a $20,000-a-year funding commitment through the South Australian Environment Protection Authority as part of the Catchment to Coast focus for water quality improvement across urban Adelaide projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is so important that the next generation of leaders learn to care for our beaches, oceans and marine life. When my children visited it, they found it both interesting and educational. They came home with many new facts about the sea to tell me.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Marine Discovery Centre has discussed a proposal with the education minister and I would like to make sure that the centre remains a relevant resource in our increasingly digital education environment. I am a strong supporter.
