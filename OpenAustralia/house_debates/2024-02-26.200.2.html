        I thank the member for Berowra for bringing this important motion to the attention of the House. I think I join with all my colleagues on both sides of the House in wishing the member for Berowra a speedy recovery from COVID. I'm here moving the motion in his stead.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 24th of this month, Saturday, marked two years since Russia, under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Putin" rel="nofollow">
         President Putin
        </a>
        , invaded Ukraine in his illegal, immoral war, which the Ukrainians did not ask for, a conflict which has brutally resulted in the cause of some 27,449 casualties—civilian casualties. That is 27½ thousand civilian casualties, including more than 10,000 civilian deaths. Just earlier today, the Ukraine defence force announced that some 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the last two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a war that President Putin of Russia thought would be over within a day or two. This is a war where he thought Ukrainians would crumble under the might of the Russian military. But, led by President Zelenskyy—this is a president who I think will go down in history as one of the great leaders of modern-day times. This is a man who could have turned tail and run. But he didn't. He didn't want a lift; he wanted support from allies to help Ukraine defeat Russia. He wanted support from allies to defend his homeland. It's an example of great leadership. We have seen the corollary of that in other countries like Afghanistan, where the president of Afghanistan left and the country fell. Kabul fell. President Zelenskyy decided that that was not what he wanted for his people, and he stayed. He stayed the course. It's up to us to support Ukraine. It's up to us to support the government and the people of Ukraine.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition calls on the Albanese Labor government to reverse their decision and donate Australia's out-of-service MRH-90 Taipan helicopters to Ukraine, as they requested in December 2023. We call on a reinstatement of an Australian embassy in Kyiv and join the more than 67 other diplomatic missions which have already returned. Sixty-seven diplomatic missions have returned. We call on the Australian government to respond to the repeated requests Ukraine has made for Australian coal to support their energy needs, just as the coalition government provided coal when we were in government. The coalition also calls for the swift finalisation of a double-tax agreement between Australia and Ukraine to support the rebuilding of this war-ravaged country. We also call upon the government to urgently deliver a comprehensive strategy which outlines Australia's ongoing commitment to Ukraine and ensures long-term multiyear sustainable Australian support for Ukraine. When we were in government we provided significant support; in fact, we were the largest non-NATO contributor to support for Ukraine. Since the Labor government came to power that has dropped down the rankings. We proudly supported Ukraine with military equipment to defend itself. The Labor government has provided equipment which dates back to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        . And we are calling on the government to provide these MRH-90 Taipan helicopters, which would immensely help them to be able to evacuate casualties from the battlefield.

          <p>
           Let me start by acknowledging we have just seen the second anniversary of Russia's brutal invasion into Ukraine. I want to acknowledge the courage and fortitude of the Ukrainian people, led by President Zelenskyy, who we had the pleasure of hearing speak at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
            UN
           </a>
           . These are the hardest days for the people of Ukraine, and we stand with you. Our support should be above politics but clearly it is not. It is so disappointing that, when we look at this motion, we see the coalition's persistent approach to politicising international crises for their own interests here at home; in fact, it is shameful.
          </p>
          <p>
           The coalition come into this place and criticise the government for our actions in Ukraine when their own party is harbouring pro-Russian supporters. The coalition is nothing but a party of hypocrisy. How dare they accuse the government of weak and too-little-too-late responses to a conflict when they cannot even keep their own back bench in line. The opposition is so strong on Ukraine that you have to ask: Why do you have Senator Antic parading around the Senate floor saying, 'The little fellow from Ukraine, whatever his name is'? That is the seriousness to which the coalition treats this illegal war. Followed by, 'you know, who cares?' in reference to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine" rel="nofollow">
            President of Ukraine
           </a>
           . We do. We care. The Australian people care and the global community should care. But, shamefully, once again, you have the Leader of the Opposition hiding, cowering away and not even having the guts to come out and rebuke Antic for his disgusting mockery of the Ukrainian leader. The opposition claim they are experts on defence and security when we know that, when the rubber hits the road, all they are in it for is just for the faux grandstanding for their own political purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
           We heard the member opposite talk about sending the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRH" rel="nofollow">
            MRH
           </a>
           -90 Taipans to Ukraine. There has been a well-documented complexity to the platform and liability issues. If fact, members opposite were the ones screaming about why were we still using them when there was a fatal crash last year? But now they say they want to give them to someone else, because they do not care. It is all about politics. All they are interested in is playing politics. The MRH-90 Taipan has been managed as a project of concern since 2011 and was unable to meet Defence's capability, availability and affordability requirements. The way the member for Berowra phrased it, it sounded as though we had backtracked due to whims and ponderings rather than actual evidence. It's just not true.
          </p>
          <p>
           After the tragic crash of the Taipan helicopters last year, the government decided to ground the fleet in September for the safety of Australian soldiers. The opposition was saying these were the worst things in the sky and they are so dangerous they should be out but then they want to go and put Ukrainian lives at risk, and they have done nothing themselves. We heard their rubbish before but what we see now is a consistent case of the opposition being all mouth when in opposition but, in government, cowering like mice in the corner.
          </p>
          <p>
           The request from Ukraine came in December, three months after the disposal strategy began. Also, the Taipans only had a few months left before being replaced by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
            Black Hawk
           </a>
           s. The advice of Defence was that none were in flying condition and to get them up to spec would have been a huge investment of taxpayer dollars. The Deputy Prime Minister said
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … we need to be making sure, that what we are providing to Ukraine is useful and is practical.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unlike those opposite, we actually look at the evidence and advice to make informed decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
           We continue to hear the carping over there from a bloke who is, ironically, on the intelligence committee but couldn't even stand around and listen to what the Americans were saying on the Ukraine war when we were over there in the States.
          </p>
          <p>
           On 15 February 2024, we announced we would provide a $50 million grant to the International Fund for Ukraine, directly supporting the procurement of priority military capabilities. Australia's overall support for Ukraine is approximately $960 million, including $780 million in assistance for Ukraine's armed forces. This is in addition to the military support that has already been provided, including 120 Bushmasters, 56 M113 armoured vehicles, six 155-millimetre M777 howitzers, anti-armour weapons and ammunition, body armour, winter clothing, defence industry packages, and financial contributions to

           and the

            UK
           </a>
           to purchase and deliver military assistance to Ukraine on Australia's behalf. Australian personnel continue to train Ukrainian soldiers as part of an extended and expanded mission into the UK. Our Wedgetail aircraft is also lending its capabilities in Germany to help protect the vital international gateway of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. In addition to the defence support, Australia has provided $70 million in emergency humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the Ukrainian people. We call on Russia to end this illegal invasion of Ukrainian territory, and we will support Ukraine until the conflict ends on their terms.

           <p>
            Saturday marked the second anniversary of Russia's immoral and illegal invasion of Ukraine. As a nation, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all Ukrainians. We share their grief. We honour their bravery. We recognise the strength of the people who for more than 730 days, against all odds, have courageously defended their sovereignty, their freedom and their home. We grieve for the lives lost and the casualties from Russia's abhorrent actions. Brutality has resulted in more than 10,000 civilian deaths and more than 27,000 civilian injuries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now is not the time for our resolve to waver or diminish in any form. Now is the time for Australia to remain steadfast and to reconfirm its commitment to fight for the rule of law and national sovereignty that every Australian depends on. These are global principles that Ukrainians are fighting for on behalf of every single Australian in their own country—principles that underpin peace and prosperity in our region and right across the world. But it is beholden on the government of the day, the Albanese government, to act. Within two months of Russia's invasion, the former coalition government delivered a comprehensive $285 million package of support to Ukraine. This included military and humanitarian assistance, visas for Ukrainians seeking shelter in Australia, and 79,000 tonnes of thermal coal. We also applied more than 800 sanctions to Russian individuals and entities and their supporters.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">
             The Liberal
            </a>
            and National parties continue to offer our bipartisan support to the government, but the Albanese government have been left wanting in their support for Ukraine and for global peace.
           </p>
           <p>
            A prime example of this is the government's failure to support the Ukraine in the form of a donation, which was requested by Ukraine, of Australian out-of-service
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRH" rel="nofollow">
             MRH
            </a>
            -90 Taipan helicopters. A formal request to acquire the Taipan helicopter platform was made by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_government" rel="nofollow">
             Ukrainian government
            </a>
            in December last year. This Albanese government refused this request on the basis that it is not feasible to return the MRH-90 Taipan to flying condition. This government preferred, and is to proceed with, the option of disassembling, decommissioning and burying the said helicopter platform. This is despite the value of each platform on the second-hand international market reportedly being around $20 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            The decision just doesn't pass the pub test. How can disassembling and burying a Taipan helicopter be a better option than giving Ukraine a much-needed aviation capability? The cost of decommissioning the rotary-wing platform and removing rare earth and dangerous materials before burial will cost millions of dollars. Ukraine's request made it clear that they would work with

            to be a key factor in saving casualties and lives in war. It is the height of arrogance for this government to say that we don't think that Ukraine and NATO partners are up to handling these helicopters. I call on the government to reverse this decision, to pause the dismantling of the MRH-90 fleet and to genuinely consult on this with the Ukrainian administration.

             I acknowledge the member for Berowra for moving this motion on Ukraine. 24 February marks two years since Putin's illegal military operation began. Even though it has been two years of bloody war, all of us here continue to condemn Russia's unilateral, illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine and continue to call on Russia to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukrainian territories. For Ukrainians whose lives have been shattered by this conflict, two years must feel like an eternal lifetime of pain. I think we should all take a moment to acknowledge and commend the unwavering courage of the people of Ukraine in the face of the horrors inflicted upon them. The physical and mental strain faced by the people of Ukraine are acute, yet they remain brave, courageous, resilient and focused on victory.
            </p>
            <p>
             I want to be clear that, despite the protestations from those opposite, Ukraine has the full support of the Albanese government. We are committed to standing with Ukraine for as long as it takes Ukraine to end the conflict on its own terms. The facts are there. Our contribution to Ukraine's war effort currently sits at around $960 million, including $780 million in assistance for the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces" rel="nofollow">
              Armed Forces
             </a>
             of Ukraine. On this second anniversary of Russia's brutal full-scale invasion, the Albanese government has announced that it will provide an additional $50 million grant to the International Fund for Ukraine, directly supporting the procurement of priority military capabilities. That contribution will be used to procure priority military equipment for Ukraine. This is in addition to the military support that has already been provided—I remind those opposite—including: 120 Bushmasters; 56 M113 armoured vehicles; 650 M777 howitzers; 105- and 155-millimetre ammunition; anti-armour weapons and ammunition; body armour and winter clothing; Australian defence industry packages; and financial contributions to

             and the

             to purchase and deliver military assistance to Ukraine on Australia's behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
             The ADF continues to remain actively engaged in multinational efforts under Operation Kudu, and our defence personnel continue to provide essential training to Ukrainian soldiers, bolstering their capabilities and resilience in the face of aggression. We've got our E-7A Wedgetail aircraft deployed in Germany to enhance security and facilitate vital military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. On that humanitarian assistance, we have provided $75 million in emergency humanitarian assistance to meet the urgent needs of the Ukrainian people, in addition to 80,000 tonnes of coal, and the government is actively considering the request for further energy assistance that's been made.
            </p>

             I need to address some of the misinformation that has been peddled about the fleet of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRH" rel="nofollow">
              MRH
             </a>
             -90 Taipans. The decision to retire the MRH-90s was decided last year following a tragic crash which claimed the lives of four Australian defence personnel. This tragedy necessitated the grounding of the fleet pending ongoing crash investigations. Subsequently, the government initiated a disposal strategy in September—months before a request from Ukraine. This disposal strategy recognised that, even if the aircraft were cleared for flight, their impending replacement by new
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
              Black Hawk
             </a>
             helicopters rendered them surplus to requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, contrary to misconceptions, efforts had been made to find buyers for the helicopters, and they were extensive. The decision was made to dismantle the helicopters and sell their spare parts—a fiscally responsible approach, given the lack of alternatives. The request from Ukraine came in three months after the disposal strategy began, three months after these aircraft were grounded and three months after maintenance ceased on these aircraft. They are just facts. They might be inconvenient for you.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's crucial to emphasise that none of the helicopters are in flying condition, nor have they been cleared for flight pending the crash investigations. It would be irresponsible and unsafe to refurbish and deploy these MRH-90s, and it would also be a substantial expense to both the Australian taxpayer and the Ukrainian military. The opposition know this, so I find it really quite incomprehensible that they are using the horrors in Ukraine, and the pain and suffering of the people there, to try and score some cheap political points with this motion. If they really want to support Ukraine, why don't they give a dressing down to their own senator, who threw insults at the Ukrainian leader on the floor of the Senate? I'm talking about Senator Antic. They know, in this Chamber—and I'll remind them—that the Leader of the Opposition failed to rebuke Senator Antic for his contemptible mockery of the

             Make no mistake: Australia remains steadfast in our commitment to supporting Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, who are defending their people, their territory and their sovereignty. We are with them on that.

              17, with the famous 'shirtfront' phrase. Next thing you know, Putin's got his warships bearing down on Australia. This bloke is a dictator—a dictator the likes of whom we probably haven't seen since Hitler rolled his tanks into Poland in September 1939. We all know how that ended: with millions of people dead—and for what? Germany rightly quashed, and the ideology that Hitler spread rightly ended.

              As I say, this conflict in Ukraine is now in its third year. We've heard a lot in this debate. I'm glad that the member for Berowra has brought it forward. I'm sorry that he's not here—he's unwell—and he can't speak on it. He did write an excellent piece in the

              , where he mentioned the Taipan. As he pointed out in that op-ed, 'Australia has used the Taipan helicopter since 2007.' I get the argy-bargy, backwards and forwards, about the fact that it has not been provided. I understand the government's position on this, in one sense, but it's better than having nothing at all. I get that manufacturers don't like their equipment, particularly flying machines, being passed on once their use-by date has been reached or their purpose has been fulfilled. Yet I don't think at the moment the Ukrainians care what they've got or in what state it is; they just want something to be able to repel the Russian forces. I tell you what: if your hospitals are being bombed, your children are being killed and your country is at the mercy of an oppressor and a bully, you'll take whatever you can get.

              I tell you what, when you're up against an enemy such as Russia, when you've had at least 27,449 civilian casualties, you need anything you can get your hands on to protect your people.

              The former coalition government delivered a comprehensive $285 million package of support, and that included coal. I'm not quite sure why there has been a delay on the request for coal. Maybe it was to not offend the Greens and their preferences. But we need to be better at supporting Ukraine at this time because they need every bit of help they can get. They've received it in the past, and I implore the government to do more in this important situation.

               It is our duty, as a free and democratic society, to call out illegal and immoral actions such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which commenced two years ago this month. It is also our responsibility to support the Ukrainian people throughout their fight for freedom and sovereignty. That's why Australia is providing ongoing financial and direct military support, including a $50 million contribution to the International Fund for Ukraine just two weeks ago. This grant takes our overall contribution to the Ukrainian fight to just shy of a billion dollars.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, Australia's contribution to this fight is not simply about dollar figures or token contributions. It is about providing effective support to the Ukrainian armed forces and, importantly, to Ukrainian people. We cannot simply throw old, discarded equipment at this conflict. Instead, we must provide appropriate and effective military equipment that can act as force multipliers for the Ukrainian armed forces on the ground. The

               -90 Taipans, to which the member for Berowra has referred, have been managed as a project of concern since 2011. They have been subject to extensive disassembly, and no aircraft are currently in flying condition. The last thing we want is for our support to cause further harm or be a force degrader, sapping up important time and resources to be maintained.
              </p>
              <p>
               That is why our government made the decision to not provide Taipan helicopters to Ukraine. Ensuring that our support is both practical and useful is essential and that will continue to be at the heart of all decisions we make about support for our Ukrainian brothers and sisters. That's why we have donated Australian assets, such as Bushmasters and M113s, which are making a practical difference and are saving lives on the ground in Ukraine. Australia's E-7A Wedgetail aircraft is providing support in Germany to protect the international gateway of military and humanitarian support into Ukraine. It is also why our government is proud to contribute to the multinational effort to train Ukrainian infantry through Operation Kudu. Australian defence personnel are in the United Kingdom on an extended and expanded mission to share knowledge and provide training to Ukrainian soldiers to ensure that they are best equipped in the fight against the Russian invasion. Our support to Ukraine, however, is not limited to military assistance. We have also provided $75 million in value for humanitarian assistance to support the Ukrainian people through this extraordinarily challenging and dangerous time. This funding provides support for basic necessities like food, water and shelter.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Albanese Labor government is committed to providing material and financial support that will better equip the Ukrainian armed forces in their fight. Sadly, those opposite are more interested in politicising a serious international issue than in supporting our efforts. In fact, the difference in approach between the Albanese Labor government and the Liberals opposite towards defence more generally could not be starker. While they viewed national security and defence policy as an opportunity for a media release, we understand the importance of developing and implementing a sound defence strategy for the long term. That's why this government commissioned the Defence Strategic Review and is responding to its findings to better equip our military to protect Australia and its partners. Just last week, the Deputy Prime Minister announced a plan for a larger and more lethal surface combatant fleet for the

               The Albanese Labor government is committed to standing with Ukraine in their fight against Russia's illegal invasion. We remain absolutely steadfast in our support for the defence of their people, their territory and their sovereignty for as long as it takes for Ukraine to end the conflict on their own terms.

                I oppose the motion in its specifics, as I'll explain, but I do join with the member for Berowra in acknowledging the strength, determination and courage of the Ukrainian people. War is always terrible, and comes with terrible cost. Tens of thousands have died on both sides of this war and, alongside the deaths, there will be at least as many injured—many scarred for life—children left without parents, infrastructure damaged beyond repair and a whole generation set back in their lives by the disruptions that this war invariably created and will create. It will leave a lasting legacy.

                The conflict between Russia and Ukraine did not begin two years ago, as we know. The immediate roots of the current conflict lie in the political changes in Ukraine in 2014, and Russia's attitude and action at that time. This time marks two years since the invasion of Ukraine, an independent and democratic nation, by Russia.

                conflict then, and this invasion now, are part of a wholly evidenced attitude on the part of Russia that it does not consider Ukraine as an independent state. Russia viewed Ukraine as a vassal state, not one that could freely choose its own foreign or trade policies but one which had to choose within the bounds that suited Russia. Australia's attitude stands in contrast: Ukraine is a democracy and we are obliged to support its democracy, as we do democracy everywhere. The democratic spirit binds us in friendship with many nations. Elections are in fact due in Ukraine this month, and it's of course unlikely that they'll be able to take place now until the war and the state of emergency caused by this invasion are over.

                The Albanese government was elected on 21 May 2022. It's a measure of our solidarity with Ukraine that on 3 July 2022, before this parliament had even commenced, the Prime Minister visited Ukraine and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling the invasion a gross violation of international law. The Albanese government is funding and has contributed to the military defence of Ukraine, and we do so without diminution. The government considers each request made to it and responds after considering the best advice, and it's inappropriate to politicise that support. In December 2021, the Morrison government announced that the

                ditching and the fatal crash in the Whitsundays a year ago, this government immediately grounded the fleet and has moved to replace it with Blackhawks. In other words, two governments have been on the same page in relation to those machines until the opposition saw some benefit for its current political purposes.

                The Albanese government is following the advice of experts within the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
                 Department of Defence
                </a>
                in relation to the helicopter question and will continue to do so. The opposition can pretend it knows better than the experts if it likes. But, further, it is regrettable that the opposition has sought to campaign for the re-establishment of an embassy as a way of demonstrating support in a war. The decision of when Australia opens its embassy in Kyiv will be determined upon the advice of the department, taking account of the safety of ambassadorial staff. Neither I nor the member for Berowra nor any other members of this place should be pushing for this during a war. The suggestion is reckless and shows no consideration or respect for our consular staff. They are not surplus military hardware.

                Viewed objectively, Australia's commitment to Ukraine is bipartisan and has been consistently so over the last two years. So this motion is an unfortunate deviation from that bipartisanship. Our overall support amounts to almost $1 billion, $760 million of which is military assistance. The most recent commitment was on 15 February, a $50 million grant to the International Fund for Ukraine, directing and supporting the procurement of military capabilities. Apart from direct financial assistance, our support has included 120 Bushmasters, 56 armoured vehicles and six howitzers, as well as ammunition and armour. Australian personnel continue to train Ukrainian soldiers as part of an extended and expanded mission in the United Kingdom.

                War is a dog that is always hungry. I abhor the decision by the Russian government to invade Ukraine, and I hope, as all members do, for a speedy resolution to this terrible conflict. Until that time, Ukraine can count on Australia's continued friendship and support.
