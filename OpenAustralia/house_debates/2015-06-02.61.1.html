        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Counter-Terrorism. Will the minister update the House on action the government is taking to counter violent extremism and keep our community safe?

         I thank the member for Dobell for that question. Every day, this government is working with its state and territory colleagues to combat violent extremism. Recently, at the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council, the Attorney-General and I had the opportunity to update our colleagues about the current threat environment, and all of those present reiterated their determination to disrupt and degrade terrorism in all its forms. This sensitive work is already underway, with intervention programs operating in every single state and territory. This work is vital to keep our nation safe, because the number of Australians with hands-on terror experience continues to rise. More than 250 Australians are now actively fighting with or supporting terror groups in Syria and Iraq, and Australians continue to be groomed by extremists in an effort to radicalise and recruit our young people in particular. This government will work with communities to provide the support they need to turn those who would be susceptible away from this dark and violent path.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government's approach to countering violent extremism comprises four tiers: building strength in diversity and investing in social cohesion; focus work with communities where people are vulnerable to radicalisation; challenging and tearing down extremist propaganda; and intervention and diversion of radicalised or radicalising people.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is investing $40 million in major initiatives to turn vulnerable individuals away from these extremist ideologies. This funding allows the government to work with grassroots organisations to support early intervention and to tackle extremist groups online. We are also providing almost $13Â½ million through our Living Safe Together intervention programs. These programs identify people who are at risk and deliver tailored services to help them away from the ideologies of violence and hate. There has already been $1.6 billion allocated for 34 community based organisations under this program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other examples of the work this government is doing include a half a million dollar grant to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Museum" rel="nofollow">
          Islamic Museum
         </a>
         of Australia. This will provide a new education program to promote understanding of Islamic art and culture which in turn promotes social cohesion. We are also allocating $200,000 to the Bachar Houli Academy, run by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , for a high-performance leadership program for junior footballers of Islamic background. The Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Social Services
         </a>
         has also allocated $650 million for settlement services that promote integration into our society.
        </p>
        <p>
         Community partnerships are vital in attacking violent extremism, because intervening early requires the support of everybody in the community. Like the Minister for Education said, educators, police and partnerships will remain vital to turn people away from radicalised and violent ideologies.
