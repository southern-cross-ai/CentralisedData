       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 2) 2014-2015, along with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015,which was introduced earlier, and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015, are the budget appropriation bills for the 2014-15 financial year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of just over $8.4 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now outline the significant items provided for in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Communications" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Communications
        </a>
        would receive just over $3.2 billion once this bill commences as an act. This is required to provide funding to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        Co to continue to roll out the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        . This is in line with the government's updated Statement of Expectations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, this bill would provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        with just under $2.5 billion in capital funding. This reflects in part the budget measure
        <i>
         Defence funding profile
        </i>
        ,which bringsforward funding from 2017-18 and distributes it over the period 2013-14 to 2016-17, including $300 million in this bill. This funding will support important capabilities, including in the Approved Major Capital Investment Programme. The remaining $2.2 billion included in this bill provides funding for existing investment commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, the bill would provide the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development just over $564 million, reflecting four matters. Those are: to incorporate the government's new Bridges Renewal Programme; the Roads to Recovery programme; funding local councils for non-network road projects; and funding for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Latrobe Valley
        </a>
        economic diversification.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fourth, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        would be provided with just under $294 million. This reflects a $200 million capital injection to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Finance_and_Insurance_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Export Finance and Insurance Corporation
        </a>
        as well as $10.3 million in capital expenditure for Australian embassies in Kabul and Baghdad.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill would also increase the general drawing rights limit for general purpose financial assistance payments to $5 billion and the general drawing rights limit for national partnership payments to $25 billion. These limits are being increased in prudent anticipation of forward expenditure in priority policy areas such as infrastructure, and will give the Commonwealth capacity to respond to changing circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill and the portfolio budget statements tabled in the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
