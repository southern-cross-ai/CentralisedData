       <p>
        Recently I had the honour of attending the official book launch of
        <i>
         Before Forest Lak
        </i>
        e, by Vicki Mynott, a local resident, as part of the Richlands, Inala and Suburbs History Group. History buffs and other interested community members gathered at Forest Lake Community House, where I was pleased to be joined by my good friend and local councillor Charles Strunk, who declared the book officially launched. The President of the Richlands, Inala and Suburbs History Group, Angela Naumann, said the book was made possible by the hard work of Vicki Mynott and past and present community members who contributed their stories and memories to the project. Special mention must go to Forest Lake Community House, who founded the production of the book and provided the venue for the launch, alongside the Blue Fin Fishing Club and the Forest Lake Photography Club, who were also big supporters of the event.

       <p>
        <i>
         Before Forest Lake
        </i>
        is one of over 10 books the history group have produced over the 20 years since it was formed in 1996. These books share the history of our local area and ensure it is recorded for future generations. A signed copy of the book will be auctioned later this year at the annual chaplaincy dinner to raise vital funds for the Forest Lake Uniting Church. Well done to Vicki and all the members of the history group for another superb book, capturing our history for the future ahead.
