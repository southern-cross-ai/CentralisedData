       <p>
        One of the most rewarding aspects of my job as member for Berowra is creating community change with real results. That's why I've been so proud of this government's Stronger Communities Program, which supports the local organisations that enrich our lives. This program contributes to projects that are delivered in the short term, with impressive impacts that the community will see for themselves over the coming months. My job in this place, first and foremost, is to represent the people of Berowra and my duty is to deliver for them. It's given me great pride to be able to do so by boosting the organisations that better Berowra every single day. Nineteen different community organisations in my electorate have shared around $150,000 in government grants, allowing them to strengthen the services they provide to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to take this opportunity not just to shine a spotlight on what I'm delivering for Berowra but to celebrate the organisations that often go unsung. Scouts provide a fantastic environment for our boys and girls to learn leadership skills and grow through adventure and challenge. I am particularly proud to support multiple scout groups as they mentor the leaders of tomorrow. West Pennant Hills

        received a $10,000 grant for their new roof, replacing their cracked covering, which dates back over 50 years. Cherrybrook Scout Group was granted $8,000 for a hall extension so they could keep up with demand for their excellent programs. Normanhurst Scout Group also received $8,000 for the renovation of their ageing kitchen, helping them to better cater for our community. The Asquith Scout Group was thrilled with their $8,000 grant, which allows them to increase accessibility through a disability grant. Finally, the

        -Mt Kuring-gai Scout Group received $2,500 for new shelving, helping them to properly store the equipment they work so hard to acquire through fundraising. In total, five Scout groups will grow thanks to this funding. Scout troop leaders like Kevin Pidd and Justin Kingston exemplify Australia's fine tradition of service through their volunteer leadership.

        Sporting organisations also play a big role, not just in keeping us active but in strengthening our local identity through the bonds formed by teamwork and competition. Beecroft Bowling and Recreation Club has benefited from $5,000 for recarpeting. The club has a history dating back more than 100 years, and maintenance projects ensure it has a viable and vibrant future. Cheltenham Recreation Club is celebrating the new corrugated roof on their croquet clubhouse, thanks to a $9,000 grant. Their president, Lesley Tregoning, told me the funding has been a godsend as their roof has been leaking onto their equipment. Cherrybrook's Greenway Giants have received $5,000 so they can upgrade their ride-on mower, which maintains their baseball diamond.

        at Dural is the go-to destination for futsal in Sydney, and a $14,000 grant will allow them to renovate their decades-old kitchen and better cater for the thousands using their facilities every week.

        The Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Sailing Club is grateful for the $12,000 grant which will see them upgrade their Brooklyn clubhouse. I'm looking forward to sailing with them in March. The Hornsby Berowra Junior

        Club benefitted from $4,000 in funding for the much needed improvement of their canteen. Two parents-and-citizens groups were passionate advocates for their schools and are deserving of funding: The Normanhurst West Public School P&amp;C were granted $5,000 for new all-weather covering that will keep kids sun-safe and active. The Arcadia Public School P&amp;C are installing new flyscreens and roller blinds on their canteen to improve their food preparation environment, thanks to a $3,000 grant.

        Berowra owes a debt to its volunteers, and helping them help others is a rewarding experience. Hawkesbury River Rescue are currently acquiring new equipment, like heat-seeking radars, thanks to a $17,000 grant, with volunteers like

        </a>
        and Ben Severs being among the many who patrol Berowra's waterways and keep us safe. Wisemans Ferry Community Men's Shed, led by Adrian Acheson, are in the market for a community bus after receiving $10,000 to keep their isolated and elderly residents on the move. The Berowra Rural Fire Brigade received $7,000 so they could increase their storage capacity and be better equipped in the event of an emergency. Studio ARTES, led by Deb Sazdanoff in Hornsby, is an incredible and inclusive facility for people with disability, and a $14,000 grant will help them upgrade their exhibition space and showcase the talents of the amazing young people who perform there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'd like to thank the Berowra Stronger Communities Committee who administer the grants in our area. Chaired by the Honourable Chris Miles, its members were Rebel Talbert, Mike de Beer, Justine Slapp, Ken Shadie, Saleshni Lala, Felix Lam and Jennifer Finlayson.

        Berowra is a beautiful electorate, offering stunning scenery, brilliant bushlands and wonderful waterways, but nothing compares to its people and the organisations they support.
