       <p>
        From young players who love the game and older players who have their eyes on the big leagues to the parents who enjoy cheering their kids on from the sidelines at home games, sport has a way of bringing Australian communities together. The electorate of Longman is home to many sporting clubs and groups who love nothing better than getting out there and playing the game they love. I used to play a bit of footy myself when I was younger, so I understand the drive and passion.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was delighted to be involved in discussions about the redevelopment of the clubhouse at Petersen Road at Morayfield last year, and I know very well the dual role the clubhouse plays in servicing Caboolture Rugby Union Club and its northern fields and Caboolture Touch Association with its southern fields. This also allows for regular sharing of the fields when there are big events on. There are currently more than 1,650 members playing Rugby or touch at the Petersen Road facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the federal government's Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, we have provided $1.5 million in federal funding towards making this exciting project possible. The project includes the demolition of the existing clubhouse and construction of stage 1 of the shared clubhouse, comprising four multipurpose changing rooms, public amenities, offices, a kitchen and a multipurpose clubroom with elevated viewing decks—on which I shall be having a beer and watching the footy—and tiered seating looking over the northern and southern fields. The other great news is that 60 jobs will be created during its construction. I am looking forward to watching the game there next year.
