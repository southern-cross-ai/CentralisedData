       <p>
        I rise to speak on the Walk to End Women's Cancers which was held over the weekend on the 16 and 17 March and to acknowledge all the women and men who took part in that walk to raise funds for research to find solutions to cancers that take away the lives of our women. I want to acknowledge four women in particular who participated in the walk and wanted to help make a difference in reducing the prevalence rates of cancer in women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alecia Benzie, Kelli Carnachan, Ellen Wisdom and Cassandra Lake are all busy people who work for the WA Symphony Orchestra, but they have taken time out to participate in the walk and to raise the necessary funds to make a difference to the quality of the life of women. Between them they raised $9,000 before the event and they were hoping to increase that over the weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a warm weekend, but the gusto with which the people I saw participated and the way they supported each other and the people in wheelchairs who were affected by cancer was commendable. They had committed their time over the two days away from family and friends in order to take up the cudgels to ensure that women in the future have an opportunity to live longer lives and not be struck down at an early age with the different cancers that affect women. To all of them who participated, I acknowledge them and congratulate them on their contribution.
