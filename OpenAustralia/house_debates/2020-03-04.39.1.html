       <p>
        At 17, I became the treasurer of the Werribee Netball Association and began my career as a volunteer in lots of our local sporting clubs. I coached local netball teams for a long, long time and, of course, as a mum, I was the team manager for the footy team, I was the scorer for the cricket team and I was there on the sidelines arguing that I couldn't score basketball but would happily team manage. Every person who has ever volunteered in local sport is offended by this government. They're offended that this Prime Minister has his hands involved in what can only be seen as a misuse of public funds for his own use. And yesterday, we became aware that there's a notional $2 billion fund for bushfire relief but that people, like the member for Macquarie's people, who have been hurt by these bushfires are not getting their fair share.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that those opposite and this Prime Minister are very quick to get the shovel out and money out the door when it's for their own jobs and their own livelihoods and very, very slow to get the money out the door to help Australians in need in their darkest hoursâ€”like small businesses and the people who work for them. The government are being completely lacking in a constructive approach to this, and it stands in stark contrast to the way they look after themselves in this place.
