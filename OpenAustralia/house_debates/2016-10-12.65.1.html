        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House on why it is crucial to have a strong and coherent position on important geostrategic and international security issues?

         I thank the member for Brisbane for this important question. Coherence and consistency in what we say and do is how countries communicate and advance their interests in geostrategic and international affairs. Incoherence and inconsistency in foreign policy creates, at the very least, potential for mixed messages and miscalculation. The government's position, for example, on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
          South China Sea
         </a>
         is clear and has been consistently articulated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday I invited the Leader of the Opposition to show some leadership and end the confusion on where Labor stands on the South China Sea disputes. Instead, he only added to Labor's confusion. On the one hand Labor is calling on all parties to de-escalate tensions, but then it backs freedom of navigation operations within 12 nautical miles of disputed land features that would escalate tensions. Labor's shadow Defence minister said it is not appropriate for the Australian government to give orders to the military on such freedom of navigation operations. That is an extraordinary position roundly criticised by the former Labor Prime Minister
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
          Paul Keating
         </a>
         as 'shocking'.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Senator Wong, weighed in and said Paul Keating is 'completely right'. Then the Labor leader and former foreign affairs shadow minister contradicted the opposition Defence minister, claiming, 'It should be the government that determines whether a freedom of navigation operations are held.' But there is more. Then the Leader of the Opposition contradicted his deputy as well as the shadow foreign minister and Paul Keating by saying he was 'not going to start telling the military how to sail their ships'. All the while, he is refusing to confirm that it is Labor policy for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Navy
         </a>
         to sail within 12 nautical miles of contested features in the South China Sea.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Leader of the Opposition has no idea whether he is escalating or de-escalating but, more seriously—and dangerously—he has no idea who is in charge of the Australian military. All members should reflect on this: the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the chain of command in a civilian government. I suggest you start with the Constitution. Seriously?
