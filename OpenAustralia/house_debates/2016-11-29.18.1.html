       <p>
        During the election campaign I spoke to many small businesses in Dunkley. Dunkley is home to over 16,000 small businesses, one of the contributing factors to why we have the highest economic growth of any Victorian federal electorate. It is not without trial and heartache. Successfully starting up a small business is difficult. I, myself, have owned my own small business, as did my father before me. And we, along with many of the Dunkley locals that I have spoken to, such as Danny at Il Castello Pizzeria or Sharon at the Pines Milk Bar, have battled the constant obstruction and hindrances of red tape.
       </p>
       <p>
        I mentioned in my maiden speech that I am a Liberal because I believe in small government. Over-regulation strangles small businesses that often do not have the resources to cope with nanny-state bureaucracy. Often, they end up pushed out of the conversation because they do not have the resources to write a submission or to conduct self-advocacy, usually because they are busy trying to get through the day and keep their businesses afloat.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to be part of a government that supports small business. Our agenda includes protection from unfair contracts, ensuring that they are at the forefront of consultation as well as the 'shop local' campaign. It is imperative that we support our local small businesses in Dunkley or elsewhere and give them a chance by clearing the bureaucratic obstacles wherever we can.
