        Heathridge Park is a 9.3-hectare reserve which is home to a diverse range of more than 30 sporting clubs and community groups. The sportsground hosts both junior and senior cricket and football clubs, with around 1,300 participants, and several tennis, basketball and badminton clubs. The

        provides youth services at the park's facilities, and the

        are among the community groups that use the facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2019, the City of Joondalup initiated a needs analysis and feasibility study, which confirmed the inadequacy of the ageing infrastructure. The city's draft concept plan for Heathridge Park proposes a new multipurpose building, to replace the three existing buildings, and an upgrade of the sporting facilities and public amenities, to provide greater year-round use. The estimated cost of construction of the development is approximately $15.7 million. The next stage of the process will be the detailed design and tendering for the construction phase, subject to the necessary local, state and federal funding being secured.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to highlight the disparity in the state government's funding of community facilities in suburbs located east of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmion_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Marmion Avenue
        </a>
        compared with suburbs located to the west of Marmion Avenue along the coast. In the lead-up to this year's WA state election, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGowan" rel="nofollow">
         McGowan
        </a>
        government committed $8 million to the Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club redevelopment, and a further $4.9 million was allocated to the Ern Halliday Recreation Camp in Hillarys. In contrast, only $2.5 million was committed to the redevelopment of Heathridge Park, which is located east of Marmion Avenue.
       </p>
       <p>
        As one of the more disadvantaged suburbs in the city of Joondalup, according to the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas index, Heathridge presents a strong case for additional financial support from the state government, as residents of suburbs with lower index scores generally tend to access community facilities and active reserves for social and sporting activities more often. The residents of Heathridge and suburbs located east of Marmion Avenue deserve parity of funding with their neighbours along the coast. To support the City of Joondalup, I have prepared a submission for a federal funding contribution towards the upgrade of Heathridge Park as part of the current budget process.
