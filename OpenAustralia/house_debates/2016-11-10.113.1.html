        I rise today to highlight this government's commitment to education. While the federal government of course does not run any schools, the fact is that this government is committing more to school education than any past government. And our budget commitments continue to increase over time to help the states better run their schools. Over the course of the 2014 to 2017 calendar years, the Australian government is making available $13.4 billion in education funding to Queensland. This represents an overall funding increase of $913 million to Queensland. I make the points that these numbers are obviously going up year on year and, more importantly, that these increases, year on year, are of an order of magnitude that is clearly greater than inflation. These record commitments are the types of results you get with a coalition government with a plan for the economy and growth, and this is why economic management mattersâ€”to record an economic number not for its own sake but for what it signifies in terms of our increased standard of living and the real results it delivers in all of the areas where we are truly passionate.

        Education is critically important. I consider that our schools sit at the heart of our local communities, and that is why my first act after being elected was to write to all of the P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs in the Brisbane electorate to introduce myself, provide my contact details and express a keen interest in their activities and their priorities. Today's schoolkids will be tomorrow's health professionals, our next biomedical engineers and data analysts and tomorrow's creative minds. I want to do everything that I can to promote their education.

        Over recent weeks, I held my inaugural Christmas card competition for all students in years 1, 2 and 3. It is a simple way I can help to get local Brisbane kids to get their creative juices flowing and obviously to build their natural excitement at the upcoming Christmas holidays. I had an outstanding response, with more than 500 entries from over 15 schools. What struck the judging panel, I think, was the high quality of the entries. I wish to congratulate all of the entrants from schools right across Brisbane, with a particular thankyou to the teachers that made time for the activity. I want to thank the judges, Michael Hawke from
        <i>
         Village News
        </i>
        and Leah Kidd from Quest Community News, for their judging expertise. These were not easy choices.

        So to announce the winners in year 1: first place went to Louisa Woodley,

        Congrats again to all of the winners and participants. The winners will be featured in my Christmas card that I will send to every mailbox in the Brisbane electorate this December, and I look forward to holding the competition in future years.
