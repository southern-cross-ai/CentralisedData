        I'm thrilled to share with you today the incredible success story of our local Chinese language immersion school in my electorate of Tangney. For the past decade, Oberthur Primary School has fostered an environment of linguistic diversity and academic excellence. Being one of only two language immersion schools in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , and the only one in our electorate of Tangney, it has played a significant role in nurturing our future generations. Their Chinese immersion program is a first in Western Australia, and this does attract a huge Asian student cohort. It started in 2013. All primary school students received 7½ hours a week of classes, using

        as the target language to teach Chinese literacy, maths, society and environment, music and physical education.

        Oberthur Primary School is blessed with a very dedicated principal, Mr Tim Bamber, as well as a great team of teachers and assistants. Having a team like this has been vital to preserve and foster a cultural asset like language. The impressive academic results achieved by the students are a testament to the school's dedication to language education. These remarkable results are made clear by the

        report for Oberthur Primary School. According to this document, their 'belief in the fundamental importance of positive and productive relationships is evident'. The survey showed a high level of staff and parent satisfaction, with great support for educational programs that focus on extending, challenging and preparing students for the future.

        For every parent, knowing that their child is immersed in a safe and caring learning environment gives them peace of mind. At Oberthur Primary School, this environment is underpinned by clear, shared values and expectations for learning. In their

        Its language immersion program has led to the school achieving Lead Language School status. As a result, this is positively impacting students' outcomes and the transference of thinking skills across learning areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The positive impact of language immersion on academic achievement cannot be overstated. Research has shown that students enrolled in immersion programs often outperform their peers in standardised tests. The benefits of bilingualism enhance their overall academic performance, positioning students for success in higher education and future careers. But the impacts extend far beyond just academic achievement. Through the immersive experience, students have developed not only strong language skills but also a deeper understanding and appreciation for other cultures. This year, I was honoured to be invited to attend their 10th anniversary celebration, and I have witnessed the meaningful contributions of this school, and particularly its language immersion program, to our local community's culture.
       </p>
       <p>
        When students learn a new language, they are not just memorising words but immersing themselves in the customs, traditions and heritage of that culture. This knowledge cultivates empathy and tolerance, fostering a stronger sense of community. Language immersion offers unique opportunities for social development. By learning alongside peers of different backgrounds, students develop a deeper appreciation for diversity and inclusion. These invaluable social skills create a compassionate generation of individuals equipped to contribute positively to their society.
