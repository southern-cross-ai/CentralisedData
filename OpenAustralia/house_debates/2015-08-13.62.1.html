       <p>
        I would like to raise the issue of aged care in Cowan, particularly the proposal for a care facility combined with independent living units at Paradise Quays in Ballajura within Cowan. This has been on the agenda for many years and there have been many complications based upon landownership and even the existence of the Water Corporation's chlorine facility in the nearby area. I myself have been involved since 2009. We are soon coming to the time for federal involvement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am nevertheless glad that the negotiations between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Swan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the state government have been successfully concluded regarding the ownership of the land so that facilities can be built. Now the negotiations continue regarding movement of the chlorine facility Koondoola so that the exclusion zone can also be moved and allow more a viable building program on the site. Several years ago, the Councillor Mel Congerton of the City of Swan and I met with the state minister to discuss the relocation of the chlorine facility. That cost has escalated since then and challenges for a viable project remain.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hope that these negotiations will also be successful, but I want to say that I appreciate Senator the Hon.

        so that I can keep him informed of this important project. Once the infrastructure issues can be resolved and a provider identified, then it becomes increasingly a federal issue with the application for care places being made. I am determined to get this project built and deliver federal support for my constituents in Ballajura.
