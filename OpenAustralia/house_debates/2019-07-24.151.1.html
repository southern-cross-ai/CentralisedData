        The provision of quality aged care which is accessible to families is an important priority within my electorate as our population ages. How we care for our elderly is a reflection on our society, and we must ensure that our seniors are treated with the care, respect and dignity that they rightfully deserve. There are many important lessons learnt from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Aged Care Quality and Safety, and it must be our resolve to never repeat the mistakes of the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        , the 2016 census revealed that there were 27,752 people aged over 60 years residing in the Moore electorate, representing 19.8 per cent of our population or one in five residents. Over the coming years this ageing demographic will require increased levels of care and assistance with their daily living and accommodation. Many constituents have contacted my office to express their concerns about the shortage of aged-care facilities close to home and the long waiting lists experienced by their elderly parents and family members. To meet this growing need the three levels of government—local, state and federal—must work cooperatively to fund and plan for the construction of new aged-care facilities, ranging from independent living units to more intensive nursing care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local families seek a range of aged-care options to suit the specific needs and requirements of their loved ones. The provision of additional funding to care for our senior citizens in their twilight years is a noble cause and must be a priority for our government. Established aged-care operators such as Amana Living, Brightwater, Meath Care, Bethanie, MercyCare and Southern Cross Care have a local established presence and the opportunity to increase the scale of their operations to meet the growing need for residential aged care. A significant number of additional beds are required each year to keep up with the increased demand, and these places will require ongoing funding to provide the necessary care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally there are plans to construct new aged-care facilities on sites in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Burns Beach
        </a>
        , Currambine, Edgewater and Joondalup. The federal government must ensure that additional places are appropriately funded at these new facilities to meet the ongoing aged-care needs. I have written to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck, strongly making the case for additional aged-care funding within the city of Joondalup.
