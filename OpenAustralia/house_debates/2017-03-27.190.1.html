        Our dream of a regional motorsports complex to be built in Gilmore is buried in the roots of a not-so-rare plant. That is over 300 or so construction and ongoing jobs lost. That is almost $11 million investment from the private sector and a co-funding grant of $9.75 million from the federal government lost. After 48 hours of phone discussions and clarification with federal government departments and ministers, and last-minute appeals to one state MP—because the other one for

        was already on board—the final discussion with Motorcycling New South Wales resulted in a decision to withdraw the application. They felt it was all too hard. Our community is the poorer for that outcome.

        So, just what have we lost? Research showed that a high-quality off-road facility is far more attractive to riders than local-level facilities. It would have helped to reduce the illegal trail bike use in our surrounding national parks and reserves. Motorcycling sports events, when scheduled for other locations interstate, create a huge demand for accommodation. This would have been a catalyst for new accommodation investment. Partnerships had been formed with

        Illawarra and an Indigenous employment agency. There would have been jobs across a range of skill levels, from low skill and casual for younger people and career-progression opportunities through to high-tech and advanced manufacturing and automotive positions. These are the opportunities that we have lost. They are gone—more than 300 jobs for fewer than 300 orchids.
