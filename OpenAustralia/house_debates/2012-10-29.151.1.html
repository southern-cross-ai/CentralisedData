        On the weekend, I had the great privilege of playing two full games of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_League" rel="nofollow">
         Rugby League
        </a>
        for the Murphys Creek Maulers.
       </p>
       <p>
        An honourable member: How do you feel?
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very sore. I can inform to the House that I feel like a concertina! It was all in good fun; it was all for charity. You will remember that Murphys Creek is situated right in the heart of, or on the edge of, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockyer_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Lockyer Valley
        </a>
        , which was devastated by those tragic floods early in my electorate cycle. The concept started off with a game of Rugby League whist the floods were on with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        guys, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        workers and a handful of locals to try to lift the spirit of the community. That game was the genesis for what has become a full-on tournament. When you walked in there, it felt like nothing short of the grand final of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        series! There was a jumping castle; there was a full-on fair.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were three sides that played in the tournament: the Murphys Creek Maulers; the A-grade side of Muswellbrook, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        ; and an invitational side. The invitational side consisted of the likes of

        , an international player of outstanding calibre, whose first-grade premierships consisted of 254 career appearances, 21

        , who also played twice for Australia, was present on the field, along with

        . I say to the House with my hand on my heart: I made both of them look very ordinary in the paddock! Taking the ball from the kick-off, I would like to be able to say that I took the ball up with gusto and vigour, beat the first couple of defenders, sidestepped the next one, ran out of a tackle, put a chip over the top at the halfway, regathered on the 20 to go in and score under the post. That is what I would like to say. What actually happened was that I took the ball from the kick-off and what I thought I was doing was running away from Shane Webcke, but he found me and from that point on it was a painful game. For a game that was supposed to be a bit of hit and giggle, the competitive edge of all of us came out and it was a frightful gameâ€”and I am still paying for it today!

        The Murphys Creek Maulers raised $18,000 over the weekend. My jersey itself raised $195 once they sold it off. I am sure I was run up on that, but nevertheless it all goes to a good cause. The lady that runs the pub up there, Sue Haughey, is an outstanding contributor to the community, and it is that community spirit of Murphys Creek that will continue to make sure that the community rebuilds.

        , who chairs the Men of League Foundation, was one of the recipients of 20 per cent of the money that was raised. Men in League do a lot of work in the area with reference to building league development and also dealing with men's depression. It is a great legacy that those guys have embarked on. I would also like to thank the president,
