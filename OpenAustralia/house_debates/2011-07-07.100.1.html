        On 23 May I spoke in this place on early onset dementia. Unfortunately, on that day the debate was interrupted and, whilst I was able to put some matters in relation to this issue on the record, I was unable to complete my contribution. I take the opportunity today to continue and to recap some of those earlier points that I made. When we think about dementia we typically think of an older person's illness. We generally think of the diagnosis and the effects on the elderly. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. The tragic reality is that dementia not only affects the elderly but also can and does affect young members of our community. Early onset dementia describes a person who is under 65 years of age and who is diagnosed with dementia.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is estimated that approximately 250,000 Australians are currently diagnosed with dementia and that by 2030 this will increase to 590,000—double the current number. In addition, there are about 10,000 people with early onset dementia, and it is predicted that this figure will rise to over 14,000 by 2020. These are certainly very significant figures. However, we do still associate dementia with the elderly and many people in Australia are unaware that early onset dementia exists. We need to change that profile.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is most important that early onset dementia is diagnosed as soon as possible so that we can ensure that appropriate inform­ation, support and medication can be provided to treat this disease and also that family, friends and care givers are then in the best possible position to support the person with the diagnosis. The earlier a diagnosis can be made the sooner and more adequately the issues of behavioural changes and employment issues can be addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will focus specifically today on the employment issues. Those diagnosed in their 40s and 50s have often not adequately planned for their retirement as they did not envisage their retirement taking place for perhaps another 10 to 20 years. Often people are at the height of their career, and often this coincides with significant family commitments, including mortgage payments, school fees and the significant costs associat­ed with a growing family.
       </p>
       <p>
        The lives of the carers, too, are also affected by early onset dementia. They are often the mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and partners who have to take on unplanned financial and social responsibilities when the person with dementia is unable to work. Carers are the unsung heroes in these situations as they give up their time, their money and their livelihoods to care for their loved ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        I make mention here of the Common­wealth Respite and Carelink Centre in my electorate, which offers great assistance in this area. I have met numerous times with Mrs Linda Walk, the team leader of information support service at the Common­wealth Respite and Carelink Centre at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Lakes" rel="nofollow">

        to discuss the services that they provide. I commend Mrs Walk and her team on the wonderful job they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Soon after my election, one of my first official meetings was with the President of Alzheimer's Australia (Queensland), Ms Marianne Gevers. It was greatly appreciated that Ms Gevers took the time to raise with me some of the issues facing sufferers of dementia, particularly from a personal perspective. I extend my appreciation to Ms Gevers for her active role with Alzheimer's Australia (Queensland) and note that I am fortunate enough to have her as a constituent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        . I also offer my continued support and commitment to the vision of Alzheimer's Australia 'for a society committed to the prevention of dementia, while valuing and supporting people living with dementia'.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that the issue of early onset dementia should receive support from all political persuasions. It is an illness that is often overlooked due to the misinformation out there about dementia. We must make progress to further educate the public on this health problem.
