        Each year I stand to acknowledge in this place the local recipients of some of this nation's highest honours. Across Barker, 11 outstanding citizens were acknowledged last week as part of the King's Birthday honours, the first under our new monarch. I speak in this place often about the amazing people that make the communities of Barker some of the best places to live, work and raise a family anywhere in the country. Eleven of the almost 1,200 King's Birthday honours nationwide came out of the electorate, so we're certainly punching above our weight.

        They were awarded to people such as Marilyn Pattison of Tanunda, for distinguished service to occupational therapy; Dawn Borchardt, for significant service to youth through

        ; Ken McInerney, for services to local government and the community in Bordertown; Barry Sharrad, for services to the community of Pinnaroo; Ken Wells, for services to the community of Murray Bridge; and Maureen Christie, for significant services in and around wildlife conservation. Congratulations to all who have been acknowledged for their significant contribution to the local community and our nation, much of which was via volunteer work. Barker and indeed our nation are richer and stronger for your contributions.
