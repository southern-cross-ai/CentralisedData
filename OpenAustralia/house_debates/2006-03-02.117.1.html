        History and tradition are important. They are important for political parties, they are important for the remembrance of our national heroes and they are important for planning our future. I could be provocative here and talk about preselections and how the going rate for preselection seems to be about $250,000, but I will leave that for another time.

        I want to talk about the remembrance of our national heroes and about planning for our future.

          A silly response from the member for Fisher, but of course you would expect that. It is a man called Sir

           William Rooke Creswell
          </a>
          . He came to this country in the 1850s, and he took command of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          n colonial ship
          <i>
           Protector
          </i>
          . Of course that was at the time when Australia was very fearful of being invaded by the Russians and built forts all around the coastline. Two of those forts are in my electorate—
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Glanville" rel="nofollow">
           Fort Glanville
          </a>
          and

           Fort Largs
          </a>
          . One is now a historic museum and the other is a police academy.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the period after Federation, we had naval ships here but they were under the command of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Navy
          </a>
          . William Rooke Creswell managed, against the wishes of the Royal Navy, to amalgamate those forces. He convinced the British authorities to do so, and so began the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          You would have thought someone of that merit would be appropriately remembered in this country and you would think they would be appropriately remembered in perhaps my electorate of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
           Port Adelaide
          </a>
          , where he commanded that ship, the colonial ship
          <i>
           Protector
          </i>
          , which served in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_Rebellion" rel="nofollow">
           Boxer Rebellion
          </a>

              . He lived during the Depression. Like my father—he did not go with my father—in those times, when unemployment was so bad, as 14-year-olds they all got on their bikes and rode up to the Riverland. My father did the same. Derrick worked on fruit blocks, while my father went as far as Wentworth and worked on some of those old paddle steamers.
