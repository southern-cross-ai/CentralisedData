        Recently, Harry Crethar celebrated his 40th year on the radio in Lismore. Harry and his wife, Maria, of 57 years are proud Lismore residents. Harry migrated to Australia with his mother in 1948 when he was 11 years old. When Harry arrived in Lismore, he met his father for the first time, as he had immigrated to Australia much earlier. Harry left school at the age of 15 to commence working in his uncle's cafe, Crethar's Airconditioned Cafe. He then bought the

        in 1956 from Spiros Coronakis, who became his father-in-law. Harry sold the Wonder Bar in 1980 and went on to establish Premier Picture Framing and Art Supplies in Lismore, which operated until the devastating February 2022 flooding event.
