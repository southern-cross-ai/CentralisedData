       <p>
        On behalf of everyone in my community of Lindsay, I would like to congratulate our year 12s for finishing their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC" rel="nofollow">
         HSC
        </a>
        in what has been an extraordinary year. I now hope that you have enjoyed your formals and your graduations. My eldest son, Byron, joined me in parliament this week, now that he's finished his HSC, and I couldn't be prouder of his achievements and the students in our community who completed year 12.
       </p>
       <p>
        The class of 2020 have overcome uncertainty and challenges. The HSC can be stressful enough without making the transition to online classes; being kept apart from family and friends due to social distancing and border closures; and having formals and celebrations, which are a source of anticipation and reward for all the hard work throughout the year, under constant risk of being postponed or cancelled. But, like so many people in our community, our year 12s persevered and they kept going. No matter what their results were, I'd like to say to year 12s that you should be so proud of yourselves for everything you have achieved this year. I tell my son this and I tell other year 12s this: it doesn't matter what you do next—you can always change it—but look forward to your futures. Your futures are so bright, and I hope that you now have a safe and happy break with your family and friends. Whether you work, study or decide to travel when you can, I wish you all the very best for your future.
