        Last week communities came together to celebrate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        —a day to reflect on the achievements of women and, more importantly, to reaffirm our advocacy and commitment to equality and respect for all women.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have a personal interest in this as I have always encouraged my daughter, Elizabeth, to pursue her dreams. I know how much I would resent obstacles being placed in her way through prejudice or stereotyping. Now I hold the same view with respect to each of my four granddaughters.
       </p>
       <p>
        While much has been achieved since the first Australian rally for International Women's Day, which took place in 1928, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Domain" rel="nofollow">
         The Domain
        </a>
        , Sydney, progress should never be taken for granted. Along with all the other advances women have made in a vast range of fields, their achievements in many instances occur while they juggle the more traditional roles of being a wife, a mother, a caregiver and, in many cases, a community volunteer. It is quite extraordinary but, as my wife, Bernadette, often reminds me, having ovaries helps.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would like to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of a woman in south-west Sydney. She is a lady who has made a phenomenal difference to many lives, particularly families which live with disabilities. Her name is Grace Fava and she is the co-founder and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Autism Advisory and Support Service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Grace dedicates much of her time to assisting families with the challenges of looking after children with autism. Her organisation, which is a not-for-profit organisation, is staffed solely by volunteers who provide invaluable assistance to hundreds of families on a case-by-case basis. They provide individual advocacy for families with no respite or families with children suspended or expelled from school due to behaviour attributed to their autism; a therapy play area and a sensory garden as well as a toy library for children with autism; social groups for young adults; and also    parental support groups, which cater for the linguistic diversity of my area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Originally,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AASS" rel="nofollow">
         AASS
        </a>
        services were confined to families living in the Liverpool and Fairfield
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA" rel="nofollow">
         LGA
        </a>
        s. However, their services have now rapidly expanded to encompass families living in Bankstown, Campbelltown and Camden. Apart from the face-to-face assistance, AASS also operates a 24-hour autism telephone hotline, which is run by volunteers who often provide guidance and support to families with recently diagnosed children or families battling the transition between services. I understand the centre receives, on average, 200 calls per month.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Grace is the president of this organisation, I know she spends in excess of 50 unpaid hours each week with AASS, including weekends, helping families who find themselves in desperate need. Personally, Grace has been a source of strength for my own family. My grandson Nathaniel is on the autism spectrum. Grace has offered invaluable advice and certainly has pointed us in the right direction in terms of appropriate services, particularly at times of immense need. Having had the pleasure of knowing Grace now for more than ten years, I have seen firsthand her commitment, her passion and her sheer determination to stand up for families that live with autism. Not only does Grace give freely of her time to others, she also manages her own family. But the fact is that Grace and her husband Frank have two autistic sons, Pasquale and Gianni. While her boys receive an enormous amount of love and care, not to mention the personal attention of school engagement, Grace somehow manages to balance all this while looking after the interests of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Western Sydney
        </a>
        recognised Grace's achievements and contribution to our community by awarding her the prestigious Women of the West award. Grace is a most deserving recipient. However, I know she has only recently donated her prize of $5,000, donated by the University, to assist other families in dire need, particularly children on the autism spectrum who require additional support. She understands that this money will not go far, but it is a good start. Once again, I congratulate Grace on receiving the Women of the West award. Moreover, on behalf of her very grateful community, I thank her for her determination, passion and commitment.
