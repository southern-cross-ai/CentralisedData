        My question is to the member for Flynn in his capacity as the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth. I note the strong leadership the member has provided in the committee's current inquiry into the trade system and the digital economy. Is the member able to inform the House of the progress of recent inquiries that he's been leading? Is the member still accepting submissions from interested parties? When does the member expect his efforts to reach their conclusion? And when does the member expect the report to finally be tabled?

          <p>
           Mr Speaker, the opposition is engaging in a transparent attempt to flout the very strict rules that surround the standing orders. As you well know, there is a very limited window of opportunity for chairmen of committees to be able to answer questions in question time. Question time is designed for questions from the opposition and the crossbenches to the government to hold the government to account. This has been a tactic employed by oppositions for many decades, but there was a very strict requirement around such questions, and I would urge you to ensure that those rules are abided by as tightly and as carefully as possible.

             Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. Standing order 99 has been used before, including when the Leader of the House was in the job that I'm in now. The rules around it are that the member being asked has to be responsible for the committee—this obviously applies, given he is the chair of it—and relates to issues for which he is responsible.

The Manager of Opposition Business can say that the member's responsible, but the question must relate to a bill, motion or other business of the House or committee for which the member is responsible.

There needs to be a specific example, not a general example, and the practice has been that these questions are essentially confined to timing and procedure. I've been a committee chair myself.

                I'll make a couple of points to the Manager of Opposition Business. I was very pleased to launch the guide yesterday. In my remarks at the launch of the guide, which, unfortunately, the Manager of Opposition Business wasn't able to attend due to his other duties, he would have heard me say that the guide was developed over a number of years. It first started as a short statement that then became a guide, prior to the
