        I was delighted to be asked to represent the Minister for Education to open the

        's Advanced Engineering Building, although I understand the rent-a-crowd protesters were a little disappointed. The innovative research to be undertaken there will boost three of Australia's most important industries: mining, construction and manufacturing. Supporting groundbreaking education in engineering will ensure that Australia remains globally competitive for generations to come. This state-of-the-art building will enable teaching research that is crucial for Australia's future. I believe the Advanced Engineering Building has the potential to rapidly improve productivity in industries that are not only important to Queensland but also important to our nation. It is an example of outstanding, innovative and sustainable engineering. The university should be proud of the five-star green rating achieved through the building design and it is no surprise that the building has won several

        As the member for Ryan I am incredibly proud that the University of Queensland is one of the leading universities in the world. I have no doubt that the teaching and research delivered by the Advanced Engineering Building will produce many outstanding graduates in the years to come and I look forward to hearing about their successes. With a new facility such as this, and by embracing the opportunities provided by the coalition government, I am confident that the University of Queensland will become one of the leading universities in the world.
