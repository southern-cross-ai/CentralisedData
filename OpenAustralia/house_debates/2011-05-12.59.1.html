        How can the Gillard Labor government publicly boast about helping Cyclone Yasi victims recover when it is hindering the recovery efforts and holding back money from so many businesses in desperate need? The Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements for Cyclone Yasi are a complete farce. Businesses directly hit by Cyclone Yasi in

        are being knocked back for assistance. They are told they are ineligible under the current ridiculously stringent and onerous criteria. The majority of businesses are ineligible for NDRRA category D relief despite being told that they will get access to it by this government.

My office is being bombarded with calls from people furious about this situation. These business people feel hung out to dry. Instead of spinning, start delivering and support the business people who provide employment and drive our economy.
