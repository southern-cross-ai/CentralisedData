       <p>
        As one of my final opportunities to speak in parliament this year, I wanted to raise awarenessâ€”
       </p>
       <p>
        An honourable member: Are you retiring?
       </p>
       <p>
        No, I'm not retiring! I have much to do. I would like to raise awareness of neuroendocrine cancer. I must admit that I hadn't known about this particular cancer until one of my own constituents, Karen Binstap, got in contact with me. Unfortunately, she is suffering from this debilitating disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2018, Karen presented twice to emergency, suffering severe stomach pain and, after no obvious cause was found, she was referred to a local specialist in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Port Macquarie
        </a>
        for analysis. Eventually it was determined that she had multiple liver lesions, and, once operated on, they were found to be metastatic neuroendocrine tumours. This was not the primary source of the cancer, though, which was located in her small bowel. Her journey from there has included multiple operations, multiple hospital admissions, multiple specialists and ongoing treatment in an effort to keep pace with this advancing and aggressive disease. Each treatment and medication brought with it a new set of side effects and challenges, with consistent admissions and ongoing hospitalisation. Despite all this, Karen continues to strive to be positive, though not a day goes past that she isn't experiencing pain or dealing with the realisation that she'll likely have a shortened life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The facts surrounding neuroendocrine tumours, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NET" rel="nofollow">
         NET
        </a>
        s, are startling. This year, over 5,100 Australians will be diagnosed with NETs, making it the seventh most diagnosed cancer in Australia. Seventy per cent more Australians are diagnosed with NETs than with ovarian cancer, yet we have extremely low community awareness of NETs. NETs affect men and women equally, from children to the elderly. Sadly, it takes an average of five to seven years for a correct diagnosis to be made for Australians who present. Currently, the survival rate five years after diagnosis is just 48 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite these statistics, I was surprised to learn that the current levels of support services and research into the disease are lower than for any other cancer. This needs to be changed, and I'd like to assist in changing this for Karen and others like her. NeuroEndocrine Cancer Australia has devised an action plan which includes what I believe to be reasonable requests for additional government assistance in providing resources and education, and research into the disease, and I will do everything I can to help Karen and people just like her.
