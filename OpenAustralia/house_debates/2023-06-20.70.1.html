         I thank my friend the member for Bruce for this question. There is no-one in this chamber, I think, who works harder to stand up for humanitarian entrants with connections to their community than the member for Bruce—no-one who works harder and, frankly, few who have thought more deeply about these issues in the parliament.

         . It's a day on which we honour those people who have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict or persecution. We acknowledge and we celebrate the extraordinary and transformative contribution of nearly a million—950,000—refugees who have shaped Australia since World War

         , and people in this place too. These people have brought with them significant economic, social and cultural benefits that have enriched this nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Right now, we need to reflect on this, because there are more than 100 million people displaced worldwide. Our government is committed to playing our part in addressing this global challenge. This Refugee Day, the Albanese government reaffirms our commitment to those in need. We also recognise that this means much more than helping someone get to Tullamarine airport. We need robust settlement support so that people, when they arrive here, can make their contributions, can fulfil their potential to contribute, as so many have done. We've been getting on with the job here and, in doing so, trying to bring people together in unity, not division. We've delivered on our commitment to convert people on temporary protection visas to permanent protection. Around 3,000 visas have been granted to date, and I'm pleased to advise the House that more than 94 per cent of those eligible have now submitted applications.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a government that will continue to be tough when it comes to securing our border, while never abandoning our sense of decency and compassion. We are committed to Operation Sovereign Borders and to delivering an orderly and legal pathway for people in need of our protection.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're also on track, I want to inform the House, to fill the 2023-24 Humanitarian Program. This will include granting more than 7,900 visas to Afghan nationals, in line with a strong commitment across the parliament to this. As the then minister, the member for Mitchell, said when committing the places following the fall of Kabul, this government has always said that this commitment is a floor, not a ceiling. This is consistent with our government's approach, because we are determined to do more. We are determined also to change the tone of this debate, in this building and in our communities, to a debate that's anchored in compassion and generosity and the fair go, the essence of the Australian spirit—something that, of course, has been enriched by nearly one million refugees.
