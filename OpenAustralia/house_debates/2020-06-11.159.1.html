       <p>
        There must be something in the water, because in my electorate of Bonner we've recently celebrated several milestone centenary birthdays. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate these constituents. With five 100th birthdays, three 101st birthdays and even two 102nd birthdays occurring, I took the opportunity to support some local florists in my electorate and deliver beautiful bouquets to mark these special occasions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In May, we had three 100th birthdays. Mrs Betty Badrick turned 100, and she's still very independent, keeping up to date with the latest news. Mrs Rita Young, of

        </a>
        , also turned 100 in May and celebrated the occasion at home with her daughter. Mrs Young is also very independent, and the flowers I sent her turned out to be in her favourite colour. It must be that bayside fresh air, because Mrs Gwendoline McPhee, of Wynnum West, also turned 100, and the family celebrated with her via a Zoom catch-up. Mrs Mavis Hayes, of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly_West" rel="nofollow">
         Manly West
        </a>
        , turned 101. She received my flower delivery as she celebrated at a morning tea with some family. Our final May milestone birthday was Mr William Howley, of Wynnum West, who turned 101. I called William to wish him well, and, let me say, he was as bright as a button and enjoyed our chat about current affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        This month we have some more milestones. Last Friday, I visited Mrs Eveline Persello, of Mansfield, who celebrated her hundredth birthday with her family. My flower delivery brightened her day. We all enjoyed swapping Italian stories, and she gave me some good advice, as only a good Italian nonna knows how to do. On Tuesday, Mr Donald Wilson also celebrated his hundredth birthday and enjoyed morning tea at

        </a>
        with his sons. Next week Mrs Hong Te Tran of Murarrie will celebrate her 101st birthday, and Mrs Heather Cossard of Carina and Mrs Gladys Rudd of Burbank both will turn an amazing 102.
       </p>
       <p>
        When getting in touch with their families to send out flowers, it is so pleasing to see the love and care our older Australians are given by their families and how they'll be surrounded by friends and loved ones to mark these special occasions. Delivering some flowers is the least that I can do to celebrate their livesâ€”and what amazing lives they have all led! My sincerest congratulations and best wishes to Betty, Rita, Gwendoline, Mavis, William, Evelyn, Donald, Hong, Heather and Gladys.
