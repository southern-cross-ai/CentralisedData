        The Australian government's commitment to supporting our veterans is unceasing. Today I introduce legislation that will cut red tape and streamline assistance to veterans and improve their wellbeing.

        The Australian government's reforms address recommendations made by Mr David Tune AO

          A Better Way

         to Support Veterans
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government has listened to the needs of the veteran community and announced through the 2021-22 budget its intention to bring forward these important changes to 1 January 2022—more than eight months earlier than first announced.
       </p>
       <p>
        These reforms will simplify the administration of some payments for veterans and their dependants.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will be done by exempting disability payments from income testing under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security Act
        </a>
        1991, simplifying payment arrangements for 14,000 veterans and dependants.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government will also increase access to rent assistance for our most disabled veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will benefit approximately 6,900 veterans and their dependants.
       </p>
       <p>
        Specifically, the first schedule will implement the government's commitment to exempt the adjusted disability pension—defined in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986—from the income test under the Social Security Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will remove the need for the Defence Force Income Support Allowance, known as DFISA.
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduced in 2004, DFISA was paid as a top-up to ensure that veterans who received an age pension under the Social Security Actwere not financially disadvantaged.
       </p>
       <p>
        Changes in this schedule will ensure that veterans will receive the same payment as before, but the administrative process will be much simpler.
       </p>
       <p>
        While an administrative change, this will make DFISA redundant and this bill will remove all relevant references to DFISA from the Veterans' Entitlements Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second schedule will remove the disability income rent test from the Veterans' Entitlements Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will mean that disabled veterans will now have access to the same rent assistance as those who receive it from Centrelink.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will increase rent assistance payable to veterans or enable some disabled veterans to receive rent assistance for the first time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The disability income rent test results in severely disabled veterans receiving less rent assistance than those with a lower level of disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, this measure will benefit totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) veterans, who presently do not receive any rent assistance due to the amount of compensation they receive.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third schedule will remove references to the term 'disability pension' in the Veterans' Entitlements Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        In future, this payment will be referred to as the 'disability compensation payment'.
       </p>
       <p>
        This change will clarify that these payments are compensation and will reduce the potential for the payment to be confused with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        disability support pensions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measures contained in these first three schedules will commence on 1 January 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill's fourth schedule relates to the simplification of pension indexation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently the Extreme Disablement Adjustment, Intermediate Rate and Special Rate pensions—colloquially known as the TPI payment—are split into two components for indexation purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each is indexed separately.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fourth schedule will remove this anomaly so that the whole amount is indexed as one.
       </p>
       <p>
        This measure will commence on 20 September 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will simplify
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        's legislation, policy and procedures.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will also help avoid confusion for veterans about the purpose and structure of the Extreme Disablement Adjustment, Intermediate and Special rates of disability pension.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fifth schedule in the bill introduces a pilot program for earlier access to rehabilitation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This non-liability rehabilitation pilot will enable individuals to commence DVA-funded rehabilitation before a liability decision has been made under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 or the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988

        The government introduced this measure in the 2021-22 budget in response to recommendation 6.3 of the Productivity Commission's Report

       <p>
        This report had noted that existing legislative requirements made it challenging to provide timely rehabilitation services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under these amendments, a two-year pilot will be established to bridge that gap to enable veterans to start their rehabilitation program sooner.
       </p>
       <p>
        This measure aims to encourage and enable access to voluntary rehabilitation for 100 veterans for each of the two years of the pilot.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant states: 'For what they have done, this we will do.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia owes a great debt of gratitude to all our veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill provides new measures to better support their wellbeing and that of their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want our veterans to know that Australia is proud of them and that our country will always be there for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
