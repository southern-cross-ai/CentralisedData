       <p>
        Last week, I was pleased to take the Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zed_Seselja" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , to visit the Waverley Community Men's Shed, the only men's shed in the eastern suburbs, in my electorate of Wentworth. It is an organisation that supports the health and wellbeing of men at a difficult time. Men's health sheds have been particularly relevant during COVID by providing men with the tools, the training and the social connections to combat issues such as isolation and mental health, which many men experience upon ceasing full-time employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Minister Seselja and I smelt the freshly cut wood and talked with members about our own less-then-perfect woodworking skills, we were impressed by the craftsmanship of some of the items on display. We admired an exquisite jewellery box that was being crafted by the treasurer, Rodger Jamieson, and the detail in the delicate ship being worked on by the vice-president,

        . Tom Wolf, interestingly, also spoke about his ordeal fighting COVID and how, having survived ventilation and after being in a coma for 10 days, he no longer takes his health or his mates for granted. He is grateful to be back at the men's shed turning wood in the company of his friends. While it wasn't needed on the day, I also viewed the much appreciated air conditioner that was purchased and installed for the men's shed with a successful grant from the Stronger Communities Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank the president, Clif Munro, and board member

        for facilitating our visit to the men's shed and congratulate all the members in that men's shed and, indeed, men's shed across Australia for providing much-needed support to men at this challenging time.
