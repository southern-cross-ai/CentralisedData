        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—I'm pleased to make a statement on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report into the Amendments to the Annex of the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic, 1965. Australia has been a signatory to the original convention since 27 June 1986, and the aim of the original treaty is to prevent unnecessary delays, aid cooperation between governments and secure uniformity to the highest practicable degree in maritime procedures and formalities. That's because timely, safe and efficient maritime transport for both passengers and freight is clearly in the best interests of all nations—certainly in the best interests of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The annex to the original treaty is the focus of this treaty action and contains a set of standards and recommended practices. These focus on formalities, documentary requirements and procedures for the arrival, stay and departure of ships. The amendments to the annex cover topics such as the agreed definition of relevant terms and concepts, general provisions, illicit activities, the digitalisation of vessel reporting requirements, identification, treatment of stowaways, public health and the implementation of the agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the course of our inquiry, the department of transport gave evidence in support of the treaty action, recognising that international cooperation is essential to simplify and reduce the formalities, documentary requirements and procedures that are necessary for the safe and efficient conduct of international voyages, needless to say that progress with respect to maritime transport arrangements is a matter of particular relevance to our island continent because 99 per cent of Australia's imports and exports are moved by sea.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments also support Australia in modernising its engagement with the maritime sector, in line with international digitisation standards, and they create greater opportunities to adopt new maritime technologies. The amendments entered into force for Australia on 1 January this year, 2024, in accordance with the acceptance provisions of the convention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the issues raised during the committee's inquiry include: the timing of the referral to the JSCOT, which, I'm sorry to say, is bit of a perennial grumble; the work required to meet the amendment standards; the range of measures involved in updating a common approach to integrated freight management systems; digitisation and efficiency; privacy issues; standards for illicit activities; and, of course, the ever-present matter of overlapping state and federal responsibilities. The committee notes support for ratification from government and other stakeholders, including those across the maritime industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, the committee supports the amendments to the Annexe of the Convention on Facilitation of National Maritime Traffic 1965 and recommends that binding treaty action be taken. I take this opportunity to thank the deputy chair; all our fellow committee members on the JSCOT; and, as always, the secretariat for their work on this inquiry. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.
