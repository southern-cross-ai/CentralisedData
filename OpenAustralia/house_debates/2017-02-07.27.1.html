       <p>
        It is an absolute honour to be back here in this House. I will never forget the faith and the confidence that the people of my electorate have placed in me as their member for Robertson. From

        to Narara, Spencer to Terrigal and across to Erina,

        </a>
        , Narara and beyond, it is my pledge to keep listening to the hopes and aspirations of this critical region. This means standing up for our communities, like our families who need to reduce the cost of living, like our local businesses that want to create jobs but need lower taxes and like our commuters who are sick of being left behind on bumpy old roads and with poor mobile coverage. It means fixing local streets like Ryans Road at

        and Oceano Street at Copacabana and cleaning up our local environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than ever, I will fight to ensure that these issues are heard here in this parliament and that each one of these commitments is delivered. This includes a real game-changer, the delivery of 600 new federal jobs into Gosford, which is set to be complete this year, as well as the ongoing work towards the new medical school and medical research institute at

        </a>
        . My priorities will also include keeping the pressure on local decision-makers, such as council, to make sure we build the long-awaited performing arts centre in Gosford and that we fix the intersection of Langford Drive and Woy Woy at Kariong.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud to be part of a government that is determined to keep our borders secure and has a plan to repair our budget. The people of Robertson voted for a Liberal member to represent them and build a better future on the
