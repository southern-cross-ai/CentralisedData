       <p>
        Last week, I had the pleasure of dropping in on the Wynnum, Manly and Districts Men's Shed. The shed recently completed upgrades to its facilities, thanks to $200,000 in funding from the Morrison government. The funding has enabled the upgrade of the shed's office facilities and shed equipment, including a laser cutter and dust extraction system, and the installation of solar panels. This funding boost will also support their growing membership base.
       </p>
       <p>
        Men's sheds do incredible work. Open to all men, they play a vital role in addressing social isolation and boosting men's mental health. As we know, mental health care is a top priority of the Morrison government. We've nearly doubled spending on mental health since we came to office. There are more than 1,000 men's sheds across the country, and I'm fortunate enough to have multiple men's sheds in the Bonner electorate, whose projects are often donated back into our local communities. The Wynnum-Manly men's shed has built model trains for our childcare centres and provided carpentry support to those in need. I'm always humbled by the kindness and generosity of the men's sheds towards our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        This funding boost to the Wynnum-Manly men's shed is a valuable investment in grassroots mental health care in our community. Our government is making mental health services accessible and providing safe environments for those seeking support. We are providing a helping hand to those who need it most.
