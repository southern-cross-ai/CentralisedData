        Deputy Speaker, Braddon has lost one of its gentleman:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        passed away last week at the age of 91, after a lifetime of service and sacrifice. Commencing his working life as a carpenter's apprentice, Terry joined the Army at the age of 18, transferred to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        , and spent 3Â½ years serving in England, India and Burma. Following his discharge, Terry completed his apprenticeship and also studied architecture and engineering. Terry married his delightful wife, Joan, in 1949 and this was the beginning of a significant partnership in love, business and philanthropy. Terry's work ethic and quality is renowned in the region. Terry quickly realised the opportunities that were presenting themselves, and offered himself a chance to build a business for his family. Thus began the great journey of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TG" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Matthews Pty Ltd. After four years, Terry and Joan had 120 employees and, up until just four years ago, Terry was the managing director, before selling to Vos Constructions. Terry's professional legacy will live on in the hundreds of built assets and iconic projects in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        Terry Matthews was more than a successful builder; he was a generous, caring man interested in the lives of many and prepared to quietly give of his own well to fill the often-empty well of others. Because of this, his personal legacy will most definitely live on. On behalf of the electorate, I pass on my condolences to his wife of 65 years, Joan, and to his surviving brother, Godfrey; his children, Elizabeth, Greg, Jani, Suzie and Deb; his 12 grandchildren; and his five great-grandchildren. He was a humble man, committed to his country and to his community. He will be missed.
