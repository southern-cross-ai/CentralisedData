        My question is to the Prime Minister. Fancyleaf is a lettuce farm in Morayfield in my electorate of Longman. Their power bills have more than doubled since the same time last year. The price of the stock they buy has increased dramatically, and they are now paying a fuel surcharge to receive that stock. These costs will have to be passed on to consumers, who are already struggling. When will the Prime Minister take responsibility for making things worse for

         I thank the member for Longman for his question. What we have done is to put in place measures that the member for Longman voted against. He voted against $3 billion of energy price relief. The member would be aware, as well—and I got this question from another Queenslander last week—that the Queensland budget that was handed down just a week ago, in partnership with the work that we have done, will make an enormous difference. It will mean, literally, that, for many pensioners and low-income Queenslanders, their energy bills will be zero going forward.

           They will be zero, as a result of action that has been taken. That stands in stark contrast to the 22 policies announced by those opposite, of which they didn't land one—the fact that they took four gigawatts out of the system but only put one gigawatt in and the fact that they left Australia with a national energy grid that was built for the last century. They promised in 2019, including this former minister across here, the member for Hume, to reduce wholesale electricity price to less than $70 per megawatt hour by the end of 2021. That's what he promised. He promised $70. Instead, it was $286. He promised to spend $1 billion to pump an additional 3,800 megawatts of electricity into the grid, but instead guess how much he spent? Zero. Not a single watt, let alone a kilowatt, went into the system. These are the mob that masterminded a national oil reserve 14,000 kilometres away in Texas.
