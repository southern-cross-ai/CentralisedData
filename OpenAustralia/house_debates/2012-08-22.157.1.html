        As a member representing an electorate with a large number of public servants, I rise to speak about the employment of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        in the

         Australian Public Service
        </a>
        . The government has set a target to increase Aboriginal and

         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        employment in the

        </a>
        from 2.2 per cent in 2010 to 2.7 per cent by 2015. We are working through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">

        to make sure similar goals are met in the states and territories. Disturbingly, the

        noted a decrease in Indigenous employees from 3,383 to 3,236 in that financial yearâ€”a four per cent drop. That was the first fall in the number of Indigenous public servants since 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the Attorney-General's Department, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Screen Australia
        </a>
        for their specific commitments to the COAG target of 2.7 per cent for Indigenous employment. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        also commits to a target for attracting and retaining employees who identify as a member of a diverse group.
       </p>
       <p>
        This issue received some attention at the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Labor Party conference, where delegates called on the government to provide details on progress towards the COAG targets, to ensure greater opportunities for training and development and to ensure career pathways are provided for new and existing Indigenous employees. It is also vital that pay issues be addressed and that opportunities be provided in mainstream agencies and in non-metropolitan and remote areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have written to all ministers seeking their advice on how we might together work to meet the 2015 target. I would like to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_and_Public_Sector_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Community and Public Sector Union
        </a>
        and particularly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Hay" rel="nofollow">
         Elizabeth Hay
        </a>
        for their work in supporting Indigenous employment in the Australian Public Service. The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cabinet gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander members, delegates and activists a strong voice in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPSU" rel="nofollow">
         CPSU
        </a>
        . NATSIC is about making sure that Indigenous people have a real say in the union's agenda. In the ACT, I particularly acknowledge the work of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Duncan Smith
        </a>
        , who is a tireless advocate for the needs of Indigenous Australians. We need more Duncan Smiths in the ACT.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indigenous Australians have made an extraordinary contribution to Australia, and I hope that they will form an even larger proportion of the Public Service in coming years.
