        I am a big believer in the old style of politicsâ€”the town hall, the street corner, the doorknocks; I also believe in using new technology. Of course, being in Canberra you cannot doorknock your own constituents, so last night I did a Facebook post where I asked the people of Fairfax whether they would like me to raise anything in parliament in this final sitting for the year. I had over 60 responses, so let me quickly run through what some of my constituents, in an uncensored way, have asked me to put on the agenda, albeit in summary.

        Jasmin believes we need to talk about improved quality of care for seniors in aged-care facilities. Megan says we should make people aware of the plight of unwanted animals. Peter believes we should treat all people, regardless of walk of life or circumstance, with greater respect. Stanley believes in closing Manus and Nauru; Karen agrees, and believes we need to do more to close the gap for our Indigenous population. Inger believes we need to keep

        exactly as it is. Richard is concerned by the rising cost of living. Dale believes we need a men's homeless shelter in the electorate. Lori wants action on online gambling. Jason wants us to do more on narrowing the gap with our Indigenous citizens. Leitha wants Indigenous recognition in the Constitution.

Janice wants improved, integrated transport and communications infrastructure for the region. Adrian wants fast-track road, rail and airport upgrades. Michael wants an upgraded Bruce Highway. Julie wants to see the three tiers of government working more as a team to deliver better infrastructure. Vince wants fast rail links to Brisbane and airport upgrade. Robyn wants better public transport; Scott, Sunshine Coast light rail network; Merran, an upgraded motorway to Coolum; and Murray, fast rail to Brisbane. Ian wants fast rail also and Suzanne also wants fast rail. Bernice is all about the Bruce Highway and Sunshine Coast airport upgrade.

        With only a few seconds to go, I will have to cut it there. It is only about halfway. As a relatively new MP in this place, can I stress how important it is for us to be listening to our constituents and how much I learn the more that I listen and the more that I listen and learn, the better I will be at representing the people of Fairfax.
