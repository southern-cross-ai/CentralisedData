        <p>
         We understand that these are tough times and that the pressures that are on Australian household budgets and businesses are really difficult. Australians understand the cause of those pressures, as inflation around the world has given rise to a circumstance to which we are not immune. The record is completely clear that those inflationary pressures first bit our economy whilst the former government was in power, but what matters is what we do about it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese Labor government is absolutely committed to working for Australians. The very first decision that we made was to support an increase in the minimum wage of a dollar an hour. When we did so, those opposite said that it would wreck the economy. In fact, what we have seen is the biggest increase in wage growth for more than a decade and the gender wage gap closed to its lowest point on record, and the economy has not been wrecked. The very first policy announcement of Anthony Albanese's leadership of the Labor Party was the more affordable childcare package, which was outlined in October of 2020. It would ease household budgets but, more than that, it would encourage primary caregivers, principally women, to return to the workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
         The former Liberal government criticised that, but in July of this year it became the law of the land and thousands of Australians are now reaping the benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
         In December, this government put forward a $1.5 billion package to put downward pressure on energy bills. Those opposite said it would give rise to gas market Armageddon. In fact, it has worked. Australian consumers are now up to $500 better off as a result. All of this has been done in the face of prudent economic management. We have done what those opposite never did and that is deliver a surplus. The benefit of that was demonstrated by the statement of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         yesterday, which said that inflation has now peaked.
        </p>
        <p>
         We understand that, in working for Australians, there is still much more to be done. On the 20th of this month, we will see a million Australians see an increase in their income support. On 1 November, the bulk-billing incentive will triple. We understand these are difficult times. We know the pressure on household budgets. But, while the Liberals engage in paddling around their pool of shallow politics, what the citizens of this nation know is that in the Albanese Labor government they have a government that is working for them.
