        We never should have had a postal vote on marriage equality, but over the past two months people in Melbourne have come together to stand up for equality. I'm proud to represent a community where we care for one another and where all love is equal. So I rise today to thank some of the people and organisations in Melbourne who've been taking action. Hundreds of volunteers have knocked on thousands of doors. Greens offices have been full of volunteers and supporters making phone calls for a yes vote. To everyone who volunteered and had those important conversations: thank you. Thousands of people have attended massive rallies. I would like to acknowledge the years of advocacy from rally organisers

        In Kensington, residents formed a 'Kensington votes yes' group. Residents from the group got together to organise stalls, badges, bunting and hundreds of signs that can be seen at homes around Kensington. You only have to walk down a Melbourne shopping strip to see the community support for equality.
