        It is a privilege to have a platform in this place to spotlight the contributions of remarkable individuals in our communities. While they may not be widely recognised beyond their local areas, they often serve as the heart and backbone of their communities. Today I want to highlight one such individual: Dr Hershal Cohen, who served our community as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        for over 50 years as well as at the Royal Southern Memorial Hospital, which is now known as the Caulfield Hospital. We estimate that throughout his medical career, Dr Hershal Cohen would have had about 200,000 appointments with patients. It was a remarkable career, and I pay tribute to him tonight.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, Hershal passed away last Saturday. Not only was Hershal an exceptional doctor in Caulfield, in my electorate of Macnamara; he was also my grandfather. I was proud to say that I was the grandchild of Dr Hershal and Gerta Cohen. Whenever I did, it was usually met with the stories of the kind doctor of Caulfield. I was told stories by local people of how Hersh helped them in different moments and that Hersh was extremely precious as their family doctor.
       </p>
       <p>
        My grandfather had sore hips, and I watched my grandfather struggle to walk, yet he would carry coffee and breakfast up the stairs to my grandmother every morning. He spent Sunday mornings preparing lunch for our family together at his home. It was his way of telling us to come over and spent time with each other, mainly through his famous potato salad. I watched my grandfather get on with life despite obvious discomfort, but I never heard him complain once. He served thousands of patients over his nearly 50-year career, offering comfort and healing. I think that was the most remarkable part about himâ€”that he had immense pain within himself, but he dedicated his life to fixing the pain and healing the pain of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to share two personal moments for me that encapsulate Hersh's wisdom and kindness. The first happened in the aftermath of the 2022 election when the outcome of the seat of Macnamara was uncertain. I admit I was a bit stressed at that point in time. Seeking a bit of solace, I turned to my grandfather, who reminded me of the enduring importance of family and that some things outlast politics, things like making sure I care for my daughter, Tia, above all else. The second moment was at my grandfather's final bedside. He was surrounded by his children and his grandchildren, whom he absolutely adored. It was reminiscent of a long Sunday lunch at their place, a setting he cherished. And once again he showed us the way with his quiet and gentle wisdom.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the House for this small indulgence. My grandfather was a remarkable man and he was a great member of our local community. He was the doctor for Caulfield. He was a pillar of our community, a man whose legacy I pay tribute to. He leaves behind a legacy of kindness and compassion and an unwavering dedication to medicine and to the service of others. I hope now he gets to spend some time with his beloved wife, my grandmother, Gerta. I know he was very proud of his children, Susan, Janet, Leanne, Michelle, Geoffrey and Bruce; his 13 grandchildren; and his nine great-grandchildren. They were his tribe. He was a remarkable man, and I loved him very much. I pay tribute to the wonderful Dr Hershal Cohen.
