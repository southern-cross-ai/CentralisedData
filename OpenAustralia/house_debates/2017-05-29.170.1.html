        I would like to congratulate the Grafton men's over-50s hockey team that beat Bathurst two to one to win the New South Wales Masters state title recently. The team, which was led by captain Michael Russ and vice-captain

        , was emotional with its victory, which came the day after Neville Lollback, a very well known person in the local hockey community and friend to the players, passed away. Goalkeeper Dale Neaves played a great game, along with the skill and determination of the entire team, which included Glen Coombes, Brad Deece,

        On Neville Lollback: our thoughts are with his wife, Alison; children, Jess, Mitch, Erin, Liam, Tiarn and Brayden; grandchildren, Sage and Reid; and the wider family. As an aside: Brayden, his son, scored a hat trick in the Grafton men's premier league on the same weekend. He said it was a really tough decision whether to play or not, especially after the minute's silence, when he broke down and needed to sit on the bench. Then Liam consoled his stepbrother. He went up to Brayden, patted him on the shoulder and said, 'Let's do this, brother.' And do it they did. As I said, our thoughts and prayers are with the whole family.
