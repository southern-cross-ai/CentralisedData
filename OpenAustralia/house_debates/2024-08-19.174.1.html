        It was an honour to attend a Vietnam Veterans' Day memorial service at Nerang in my electorate. I extend my respects to all those who attended the Nerang
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        service and acknowledge the service and sacrifices made by veterans of the 10-year Vietnam conflict. On Long Tan Day, we honour those who served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        and their families for their service and sacrifice to our nation. I acknowledge the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Queensland, their support group and the men's shed for the work they do to support Vietnam veterans in my community. I thank president Peter Handy, secretary Peter Cameron
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        and president of the

        sub-branch Andy Bryson for the moving service, and I thank all the veterans and their families who attended.

       <p>
        For some time, 2,500 former national servicemen have been campaigning to receive the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Vietnam_Campaign_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal
        </a>
        , for which a serviceman must have completed a minimum period of 181 days, either continuous or aggregated, unless killed in active service, wounded in action or captured and later released or escaped. Before now, this has not applied for those suffering in silence with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
         PTSD
        </a>
        . But, very recently, Vietnam veterans who did not serve for 181 days have been able to apply for the medal if they can prove they were wounded in action, supporting it with medical evidence. I want to thank Senator Paul Scarr for his advocacy so that this change might be made. I finish with this: as his eyes filled with tears, I pinned the RVCM medal to the already full lapel of Mr John Crane, Vietnam veteran, to properly acknowledge his service and sacrifice to the Commonwealth.
