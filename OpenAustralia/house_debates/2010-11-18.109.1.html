        As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, there have been many high-profile problems with the government’s energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. There has been confusion surrounding some programs such as the solar panel rebate scheme, which was unexpectedly cut off by the former environment minister. Then there was the disappointing decision of the government not to shortlist any of the eight
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian

        projects submitted under the Solar Flagships program, despite all having the backing of the WA government and despite five projects being progressed in Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, few people will ever forget the tragic Home Insulation Program which has left a nation nervously waiting for government inspections to confirm their houses are safe from fire. Much of the public focus with this mismanagement has been on how ordinary people have been affected, but it is also true that the installation industry suffers a great deal as well.
       </p>

        Recently, mail received from a self-employed electrician in my electorate, Mr Dave Glossop, reminded me of the importance of considering the industry. In his email, Mr Gossip raised some problems he has been encountering with one of the renewable energy programs. I thought I would share these issues with the House today. Mr Glossop wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am a qualified electrician and electrical contractor. I am licensed to install any piece of electrical equipment anywhere in the world. However, to be a part of the Australian renewable energy scheme, I am forced to do a course that is nothing more than reading the installation manual as I would do with any other piece of equipment. It takes a week, costs upwards of $800, costs me personally a week’s wages as I am self employed and then you are forced to join the Clean Energy Council, plus accreditation of $300. All this just to get the renewable energy credits processed for the end user, what a laborious and costly exercise and for what? I can do all of this legally and professionally but without this ridiculous accreditation the end user cannot claim credits. Why?? I want to install wind power in my own home and then for my customers but  I am forced to do a Solar Photo Voltaic course even though I will never use solar. Where is the logic in this? Please explain why, as a professional electrician I am forced to go through bureaucracy and torture of this process just so the end user can claim back

        C’s. It’s not about the installations practice because I can do it now, legally and professionally. I have installed methane generation power stations already and the power is being supplied back to the power authority without any of this bureaucracy. This process needs to be streamlined. As a nameless person once said….Please explain????

          It is important that the government maintain the highest safety standards. This should always be the first priority and there have been serious problems with their approach in the past. However, it is also important that they show understanding of how the industry works.

          I advise the House that I have written to the Minister for
