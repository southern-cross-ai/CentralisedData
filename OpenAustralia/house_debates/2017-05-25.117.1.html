        I want to take this opportunity direct to recognise a mega Chifley champion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Hooper" rel="nofollow">

        , and his outstanding efforts. He won an impressive—get this—three gold medals and one silver in swimming events at the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        last month. The World Masters Games, a global multisport event for athletes of masters age, is held every four years. This year Jason brought home gold in the 50-metre breaststroke, 200-metre freestyle and 400-metre freestyle and silver in the 50 metre-freestyle. But this has not been his first victory. He has been competing as a champion disabled swimmer for over 26 years, and during that time he has won a remarkable 163 gold medals, 46 silver medals and four bronze medals.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has also been more than just competitions and medals for Jason. In 2015, for example, he swum for seven hours straight at

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Mission" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Jason, who was born with Apert syndrome, which affects his limbs, was not going to let anything get in the way of helping out the homeless. I recently caught up with this fine Mount Druitt local to celebrate his incredible results, and I was just blown away by his commitment and determination. He sets a great example to so many in the community, and we are very proud of his remarkable achievements. He is aged 50 and has finally decided to hang up the goggles, and what an incredible, amazing career he has left behind him. However, I know this is not it for Jason. He has a heart of gold and a humorous personality that is larger than life. I am absolutely certain we will be seeing more of him in the community, and I wish him all the very best in his future endeavours.

        I also want to take a moment to acknowledge the generous work of the Bangladeshi community, which is making a big difference through their annual Good Morning Bangladesh event. Partnering with Australia's Biggest Morning Tea, Good Morning Bangladesh helps increase awareness of cancer programs and support services whilst raising much-needed funds for vital cancer research. This was their 16th morning tea, and it was certainly a big one, with apparently 500 people in attendance.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was started in 2001 by my dear friend the late Dr Abdul Haq. It has raised more than $150,000 for the Cancer Council. Although we sadly lost Dr Haq last year, I want to commend his family, including his wife Laila, daughter Ruby and son-in-law Tanveer Shahid, for continuing his important legacy. They led the Blacktown morning tea this year. Along with Mr Hannan in Lakemba and Mr Azad in Mascot, they collectively raised a further $35,500.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community also raised funds in collaboration with Rotary Australia World Community Service for 500 beds at the Cancer and

        in Dhaka in Bangladesh. The hospital was built by the Dhaka Ahsania Mission, a philanthropic organisation in Bangladesh. I pay a very big thank you to everyone who chipped in, including Dr Ayaz Chowdhury and all the Bangladeshi community, for their time, commitment and contributions. It is truly inspiring.
