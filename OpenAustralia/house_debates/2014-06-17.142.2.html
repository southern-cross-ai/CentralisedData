       <p>
        First I will make a brief opening statement on behalf of the Minister for Trade and Investment and I, and then we will accept questions relating to the portfolio. The 2014-15 Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio budget statement reflects the government's commitment to protecting and projecting Australia's national interests as an open market oriented economy and our values as a free liberal and democratic country. The government is giving priority to strengthening Australia's key bilateral relationships based on a foundation of common interests and mutual respect. We will continue to work with our friends and partners in forums such as

         East Asia Summit
        </a>

         United Nations
        </a>
        and other for a to enhance cooperation and trust between nations.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will build a new generation of people-to-people links through initiatives such as our signature new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Plan" rel="nofollow">
         Colombo Plan
        </a>
        , which will see Australian undergraduates study and work in the region. As we promised at the last election, we will have a pilot plan underway in the new Colombo Plan by the end of this year. About 1,300 new Colombo Plan scholars will be studying at four locations in our region: Singapore, Indonesia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
         Hong Kong
        </a>
        and Japan. In 2015 we will be opening up the new Colombo Plan to other countries in the region, and already China and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        have agreed to be part of it. The new Colombo Plan is raised by presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers in our region as being a wonderful expression of Australia's foreign policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also elevated economic diplomacy to a core pillar of our international engagement to help drive greater prosperity for Australia. Just as traditional diplomacy focused on the goals of peace, so economic diplomacy focuses on the goals of prosperity. As part of this, the government will continue to pursue an aggressive trade and investment agenda. This agenda is already paying dividends: the Minister for Trade and Investment has concluded high-profile free trade agreements with South Korea and Japan and made very good progress on an agreement with China. These are trade negotiations that commenced under the Howard government, and it is fair to say the Abbott government has now achieved more in seven or eight months than those opposite managed in six years. We have staged major investment forums all around the world, and almost $1 billion in commercial deals were finalised during Australia week in China alone during the visit of the Prime Minister and the minister for trade recently.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government's decision to restore $200 million in capital to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Finance_and_Insurance_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Export Finance and Insurance Corporation
        </a>
        after funds were ripped out by Labor and boost the Export Market Development Grants scheme by $50 million shows that, as the Prime Minister announced on election night, Australia is once again open for business.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism is one of our economy's great strengths. Our $43 million commitment to the new Tourism Demand-Driver Infrastructure Program and $10 million in new funding for the Australia-China Approved Destination Status Scheme will further strengthen the tourism industry and create jobs, particularly in regional Australia. Other key funding announcements in the budget include over $35 million to continue Australia's diplomatic engagement in Iraq and support co-location of embassy staff with Britain, over $51 million to continue diplomatic engagement in Afghanistan and $6Â½ million over two years to support Operation Sovereign Borders and continue regional engagement on countering people-smuggling activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fixing Labor's economic mess requires the government to make tough but necessary decisions to set the path back to surplus. The Australian government will deliver an aid program the country can responsibly afford. We are focusing on our region where we can make the biggest difference. In 2014-15 the government will spend around $5 billion in official development assistance. That will rank Australia within the top 10
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        donors. We have increased funding for humanitarian emergencies and refugees from $264 million to an estimated $338 million to strengthen Australia's ability to respond to situations, such as Syria and, indeed, Iraq.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has reversed Labor's cut to the emergency fund. They diverted $740 million out of the aid budget to pay for the blow-out in onshore-processing costs. This was a policy that made the Gillard government itself the third largest recipient of the Australian aid program. We have also increased the scholarship program by 30 per cent to help approximately 4,500 students from developing countries study in Australia.

         In December last year I was fortunate to visit Vanuatu with the foreign minister and visit in the capital the Vanuatu Women's Centre. We spoke to a young Ni-Vanuatu girl who is benefitting from Australian aid dollars. She was the victim of domestic violence. She is benefiting from a scholarship under an Australian technical college. This is an example of Australian aid dollars delivering first-hand good results in our region and dealing with two of the biggest issues facing the Pacific: domestic violence and a lack of job opportunities. Programs such as this are uncertain under this government because $7.6 billion has been ripped out of the overseas development aid budget. The goal of our nation reaching 0.5 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNI" rel="nofollow">
          GNI
         </a>
         in overseas development aid has been completely abandoned.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is the view of our neighbours in the Pacific on this government's approach to overseas development aid? It is perfectly highlighted in public by the foreign minister of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Marshall Islands
         </a>
         , who recently said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia has always been our friend but the change in their government last year has resulted in problems.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is the view of the foreign minister of the Marshall Islandsâone of our closest neighbours. It was followed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Marshall_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          President of the Marshall Islands
         </a>
         , Christopher Loeak, saying this week, with respect to this government's abandonment of overseas development aid in respect of combating climate change in our region:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Prime Minister Abbott's comments on Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper are a further indication that Australia is isolating itself on this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is the view of some of our closest and nearest neighbours when it comes to this government's approach to overseas development aid. Isolating Australia is exactly what this government is doing by abandoning the 0.5 GNI goal and cutting $7.6 billion from the overseas development aid budget.
        </p>

          Columbia University
         </a>
         , spoke in Australia about the importance of aid. He said that, with additional investment in aid, we could dramatically shift the development trajectory of the world's poorest countries and we could do it by focusing on just four goals: immunisation, malaria,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
          HIV

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
          AIDS
         </a>
         and education, especially for young girls. He also observed that it is inexplicable for a country like Australia to be cutting aid, because ultimately it is in our best interest to support the development of a fairer, more prosperous and more stable world.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was also fortunate to recently meet with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rt_Hon" rel="nofollow">
          Rt Hon

         . Stephen

          UK House
         </a>

          David Cameron

         , has called the massive increase in British foreign aid his proudest achievement in government. David Cameron said, 'We accept the moral case for keeping our promises to the world's poorest, even when we face challenges at home.'

          The UK

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         . Australia has a net debt of 14 per cent of GDP, almost one-fifth of that of the UK. Yet this government is crying poor when it comes to overseas development aid and reaching the goal that most other nations are aspiring to, of lifting our overseas development aid to 0.5 per cent of GNI.
        </p>
        <p>
         The unfortunate thing about this whole issue is that it appears that this minister has allowed close to $16 billion to walk out of her portfolio without a word. What did the minister say in cabinet deliberations when the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC" rel="nofollow">
          ERC
         </a>
         were attempting to cut so much money from her budget? Did the minister stand up for overseas development aid and Australia's relationships, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region? Did the minister say no when the Treasurer came a-knocking and said, 'We're going to cut 500 jobs from

          How does the shadow parliamentary secretary explain to the Australian people that he is to borrow another $16 billion for the aid budget? Where is the money coming from, Shadow Parliamentary Secretary?
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Mr Thistlethwaite
          <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">

          </a>
          â
         </p>
         <p>
          I know all about Labor's budget. In fact, what happened is Labor announced an additional $5.7 billion for the aid budget and then took the money away. There is no way that the Labor Party was ever going to meet its target of 0.5 per cent of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNI" rel="nofollow">
           GNI
          </a>
          . In order to do so, it would have had to increase funding by $3.5 billion in 2017, in one year alone. The shadow parliamentary secretary at the table knows that Labor never had any such intention. The misleading way that Labor had been announcing funding for the aid budget and then pulling it away to cover blow-outs in the rest of its budget is nothing short of a disgrace. In fact, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Council
          </a>

          welcomed our decision to stop diverting the money out of the aid budget to onshore immigration costs, as Labor had done.
         </p>
         <p>
          The shadow parliamentary secretary ought to get his facts right. He mentioned Vanuatu. Funding to Vanuatu is increasing under this budget. Funding to Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
           PNG
          </a>
          , Tuvalu,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
           Solomon Islands
          </a>
          , Vietnam, Cambodia, Burmaâit is all increasing.
         </p>
         <p>
          Labor's trajectory, which they were never going to deliver on, was irresponsible, unaffordable and unsustainable. We have put the aid program on a $5 billion a year funding basis. It is responsible, affordable and sustainable. We are the 10th largest donor in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
           OECD
          </a>
          , the second largest donor in our region after Japan. I am particularly concerned to ensure that the funding goes where we can make the biggest difference. Instead of spreading the aid funding around the world to try and buy a seat on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
           UN
          </a>
          Security Council, what we are doing is focusing our aid on the region where we can make the biggest difference.
         </p>
         <p>
          The shadow parliamentary secretary raised the issue of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Islands" rel="nofollow">
           Marshall Islands
          </a>
          . Perhaps he cannot understand this, so I will help him out.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marshall_Islands" rel="nofollow">
           The Marshall Islands

           North Pacific
          </a>
          . The North Pacific funding is increasing this year. The North Pacific funding goes from $4.8 million to $5 million this year. It is an increase on what Labor delivered for the North Pacific. We have also increased our funding, as I said, for humanitarian programs by 28 per cent. This includes an increase to the emergency fund of 33 per cent.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have to tell you about this emergency fund. This was so that we could respond to natural disasters. Yet it was out of this emergency fund that Labor ripped $740 million to fill a hole in the immigration budget for onshore processingânot for offshore processing but for onshore processing. This made the Labor government itself the third largest recipient of Australian government aid. That kind of reckless, scandalous behaviour will not continue. Tomorrow I am announcing the new aid policy under this government. It is responsible, it is affordable and it is sustainable.

          We are also increasing the funding for scholarships. I am pleased to say that next financial year there will be about 4,500 recipients of scholarships under Australian aid. Also, we are providing a record level of funding for the Palestinian territories. It is a total of $56 million, which is the largest amount ever provided by the Australian government in any one year. Our aid will be used to build governance and economic support in the Palestinian territories.

          of course play an important role in delivering aid and under our new performance benchmarks, which I will announce tomorrow, I envisage that higher-performing organisationsâincluding NGOsâwill receive a greater share of the aid budget should they meet those benchmarks.

          What you are seeing here is a government prepared to take the tough decisions to repair Labor's budget disgraceâthe debt and deficit disaster left by Labor, where they were borrowing from overseas to send money back overseas as aid. As the predecessor in foreign affairs,

          Perhaps the shadow parliamentary secretary ought to think twice before he breaches bipartisan confidences, as he did on our visit to Vanuatu. I invited him in to have conversations with the prime minister and ministers and then the shadow parliamentary secretary broke the confidences of those meetings.

             On the point of order, the previous government changed the practiceâcertainly in the last two or three years, and a number of members on this side experienced thisâso that a speech and a question was asked from the opposition side and answered by the relevant minister, to be followed by a speech and a question on the government's side. That was established in a number of these committees in the last couple of years. It might not have been the practice of the former minister, who is now on his feet, but I can assure him that his colleaguesâparticularly in the Treasury portfolioâadopted that practice and established that convention.

                           The worst fears have been realised when straight after the election the government failed to appoint a tourism minister. The fact is that since then we saw in the budget the worst fears realisedâall of the tourism grants being cut including round 2 of the Tourism Industry Regional Development Fund. This left regional tourism operators in the lurch. Some 450 tourism businesses had applied with matching funding and this meant that that private investment was also lost. They even tried to cut grants that had already been announced such as the TQUAL grants that had been announced in 2013. At the same time, the parliamentary secretary, the member for Paterson, was happy to pose with pictures over the internet at Labor government-funded tourism projects that his government had tried to axe.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           We also saw broken promises to increase
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                            Tourism Australia
                           </a>
                           funding. We saw budget trickery in this budget with the rolling of the Asian Marketing Fund into Tourism Australia funding to make it look like there were no cuts. We have also seen the axing of the Survey of Tourist Accommodation and we have seen the dumping of domestic marketing on the states and territories. This is particularly important for the regional tourism sector. Despite domestic travel being 70 per cent of the sector, the Queensland budget slashed that figure by some 20 per cent.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           We have also seen job cuts at Tourism Research Australia. The problem with this government is that they have not prioritised tourism. It has just been a political opportunity. As an example of that, I ask the minister to respond to the so-called Cadbury tourism grant. This was a grant where tourism was not mentioned in the original statement and some nine months after the election in the Senate estimates process, Bruce Gosper, the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                            CEO
                           </a>
                           of Austrade, said, 'In respect of the proposal for funding for Cadbury factory, that is something that we are still dealing with. We are waiting for a business plan from Cadbury so that we can take that forward.' How is it that in a budget that has cuts to health, education and foreign aid, we see $16 billion allocated for a project that does not have a business plan presented to the government from Cadbury? When will that business plan be presented? Will it be made public and transparent and when will this grant actually occur?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This stands in stark contrast to the fact that regional tourism operators including those in Tasmania have been left behind by the cutting of the Tourism Industry Regional Development Fund. How does the minister justify the $16 million grant for an application that never got put forward before the former government and compared thatâor it was not an application either for the Tourism Industry Regional Development Fundâwhile at the same time they are making these cuts in this area?

                            I ask a series of questions to the Minister for Trade and Investment about a very important part of the budget, namely, the Export Market Development Grants program. As the members on this side of the chamber know, this is an important program that supports entrepreneurs and growing businesses across Australia. I am particularly interested in the funding within the appropriations for this particular grants program, how that compares with funding during the last couple of budgets, and any changes or enhancements that the government has made to this important program. As members are well aware, businesses seek grants from this program on the basis of growing their export businesses. I would ask the minister how the funding compares and about any changes that have occurred within this budget.

                                I thank the member for Casey for his question. I suppose one of the most successful business programs over a long period of time has been the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. Yet we saw in a desperate bid to prop up or establish that proxy surplusâthat dud surplus that they spent years trying to present, but only to the effect of introducing the four biggest budget deficits in our historyâone of the many, many programs that the previous government attacked was this most effective Export Market Development Grants Scheme. No wonder 512,000 people in the small business sector lost their jobs during the term of the previous administration. They have no sense of the innovative capacity or the job creation role of the small business sector. As a consequence, they even cut $25 million from this very important program.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                The government now has sought to turn around the prospects of the small business sector, and in regard to the export market development grants we have added an additional $50 million over four years to enable our small and medium sized business sectors to identify and gain from a lot of the important opportunities that are starting to emerge in the region around us. Not only have we increased the amount of money; we have increased the maximum number of EMDGs from seven to eight. This will, in many ways, provide significant benefits. We have reduced the eligible expenditure threshold from $20,000 to $15,000 and we have reduced the current $5,000 deduction from the applicant's provisional grant to $2,500. All of this will enable the payment of grants in years of low scheme demand, or where additional funding is provided.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                This is a comprehensive program at a time when we are desperately looking to have the government live within its means. There are two ways of doing that: you cut spending that is excessive, but you also grow the economy at the same time. A big part of growing the economy is breathing life back into our small business sector. This is one of the programs that gives confidence and opportunity to the small business sector to contribute in the way in which they can and they should and they must. I am very pleased to announce and support this government's initiative.
                               </p>

                                Could I just touch on the scare campaign that we heard from the other side of the table, the absolute scare campaign about the tourism budget. I do not accept any of the assertions. The shadow minister opposite went through a whole series of falsehoods. The tourism sector has overwhelmingly accepted this. We are as a government backing our strengths by putting tourismâ

                                      I will tell you what we are not going to do: we are not going to let the carbon tax increase the industry's costs by another $115 million. If you were serious about supporting the tourism sector you would support the scrapping of the carbon tax. It cost the tourism sector $115 million last year. Where are you? You are just full of scare campaigns, full of false assertions. We in this budget have massively supported the tourism sector. We are very proud of what we have done in this budget.

                                        Point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. You have asked for interjections to cease. Despite asking for interjections to cease fromâhe is not the Manager of Opposition Business, he just acts like he isâthe member for Grayndler. He continued to interject right through the minister's answer. If he thinks there is a special rule for him, that is fine, but I would ask you to enforce the standing orders. Otherwise, if the rule is your rulings on interjections are to be ignored, this side of the House will reciprocate when they are asking questions and making speeches. I prefer not to. I would prefer that your rulings were upheld.

                                             allocation includes some very significant shifts in both funding and emphasis. Under the previous government reform occurred to substantially improve both the quality and quantum of Australia's international development assistance. Aid effectiveness depends on both these aspects. It depends on the benefits delivered and the outcomes achieved on a per dollar basis, and it depends on how many dollars are applied. No amount of rhetoric can change that.

                                             peer review praised the efficiency, transparency and effectiveness of Australia's aid program. This government has decided to reduce Australia's foreign aid and alter its priorities so there is less importance placed on saving lives and reducing poverty.

                                             There is no basis for the claim that the government will make Australian aid more effective. Indeed, on the basis that our ODA allocation has been reduced by 12 per cent on this year alone and that every cent of planned growth has been cut, there is no doubt that the effectiveness of an Australian aid will be decreased. Can the minister point to any evidence that cutting aid will provide more effective aid? Can the minister point to any analysis that called for the cuts they are making? The reality is that, with this government's approach, fewer lives will be saved and less will be achieved in terms of improving the health and welfare of those experiencing extreme disadvantage, and that will be the case both in our region and elsewhere.

                                             The government has made much of the shift to an even greater focus on our regionâfrom 86 per cent of all aid assistance to 91 per cent now delivered in the Asia-Pacific. But the reality is that 91 per cent of a severely reduced allocation is substantially less in most cases than what was to be delivered in 2013-14 and beyond. One of the trickiest lines in the government's budget document states that:
                                            </p>

                                             Most countries within the Indo-Pacific have received an increase on 2013-14 funding levels.

                                             That is only true because almost every country was first made to suffer a heavy cut in 2013-14. Minister, how many countries in our region will have an increase in support from the allocations in the 2013-14 budget?

                                             the 2013-14 budget allocation was $188 million. As a result of the government's cuts the support in this year will only be $168 million, a reduction of $20 million or 13 per cent. Essentially one in every eight dollars is being withdrawn.

And in 2014-15 it will drop a further 13 per cent to $97 million. Timor-Leste is a country with some very serious development challenges. It is the poorest country in our region, it has the equal-highest rate of child malnutrition in the world and it is hard to understand how anyone can justify a country assistance allocation in 2014-15 that will be 23 per cent lower than what was allocated in 2013-14. Can the minister outline which health, education or child nutrition outcomes will be affected by the cut of one in every five dollars of assistance to Timor-Leste?

                                              My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Could the minister update us as to what has been happening with the

                                              Gender equality and womenâs empowerment will be a key priority across the aid program. Australia will continue to take a lead role on gender equality and womenâs empowerment in our aid program and advocacy, including through the Ambassador for Women and Girls.

                                              This follows the minister's earlier remarks that she would place the issues facing women and girls at the heart of Australia's foreign policy. As the minister knows, I have been a very strong advocate for

Can the minister please provide advice on the steps the Australian government has taken to improve the conditions facing women and girls? And, specifically, can the minister detail what the government is doing to end sexual violence?

                                              last year I highlighted the level of physical and sexual violence in the Pacific. In 2008, 67 per cent of women in

                                              reported having been beaten by their husbands, with 50 per cent of married women having experienced marital rape. In 2009 in the

                                              , 64 per cent of women experienced physical or sexual violence from a partner. Anecdotal evidence from aid workers on the ground suggests that the true figure could be even higher. I know from the minister's time as Minister for Women's Issues under the Howard government and then as shadow minister for foreign affairs and trade that she is deeply concerned about physical and sexual violence confronting women.

                                              also ask the minister what the Australian government is doing to address the barriers that prevent women from participating in the formal economy? I am particularly interested to know what support the government has been giving to improve education and health outcomes for women and girls. I know that the minister's strong personal commitment is to provide scholarships for students in developing countries, as was highlighted in her statementâand I welcome her statement today. But I refer the minister to her comments at the

                                              I'm also keen to focus our aid scholarships on opportunities for young women and girls, an investment that can pay extraordinary dividends. An educated girl is a girl who has the tools to change not only her community but to change the world. Education and its long-term social and economic benefits will be an important part of our aid and soft-power diplomacy efforts and scholarships will be a signature policy.

                                              Removing the barriers that prevent women's economic empowerment will promote sustainable economic growth in developing countries. It has been said that women in developing countries perform 66 per cent of the work, produce 50 per cent of the food, earn only 10 per cent of the income and own one per cent of the land. Can the minister outline the importance of women's economic empowerment to the Australian government, particularly the focus on economic development and their role in poverty reduction generally?

                                                        Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I agree with the points made by the member for Brisbane. That is why Labor in government committed to spending more on combating domestic violence and women's programs, particularly in the Pacific, through Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development. The whole problem with the cuts to overseas development aid that have been undertaken by this budget is that we do not know which programs are going to be cut. At this point in time the government will not release the details of where the cuts will come from. Importantly, the Australians who are delivering these programs throughout the world, particularly through the diplomatic footprint that Australia has, are facing job losses. Some $400 million will be cut from
                                                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">

                                                        will lose their position. How is that consistent with improving the role in diplomacy that Australia plays, particularly in the Pacific, relating to women's programs? This is one of the most important roles that the government has in foreign affairs. The role of the departmental officers in DFAT, protecting Australians overseas, can never be underestimated. We are seeing at the moment the great work that departmental officers are doing with respect to the conflict that is going on in Iraq and the great work that Australian officers are doing in protecting the interests of Australians who are facing difficult circumstances in Iraq.

                                                        Where was the minister? Did the minister object to this funding being removed from her portfolio and the 500 jobs being cut from DFAT? The minister said earlier in an interview with the

                                                        that she saw her role as changing the erosion that had occurred and vowing to fight for more funding for Australia's cash strapped foreign services. She said she would be drawing up plans to expand the nation's diplomatic footprint. The minister said in December last year:
                                                       </p>

                                                        It's time for DFAT to reassert its position as the primary source of advice on foreign policy.

                                                        How can that occur when 500 jobs are being cut from the department? These are hollow words from a minister who has not fought for her department and has not stood up for the rights of her troops. All of this is in the context of the government spending $113,130 on three websites for three ministers. All that money was spent on three websites for three ministers. This was disclosed in estimates.

                                                         Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I will not have my name slandered in that way. That $113,000 related to 100 websites around the world. It was a decision taken by the previous Labor government in 2012, so do not stand in this place and cast aspersions on me. You said you were going to take so little time that I could finish by 1.30 pm. I said that I had to leave by 1.30 and now you have taken up all the time.
                                                        </p>

                                                         So you did not ask a question and you made a false statement in this parliament. I will not stand here and have you say that my website cost $113,000, when Labor took a decision in 2012 to upgrade 100 websites around the world.

ECA is a joint employer-union initiative that has been established to promote ethical working conditions throughout the supply chain and to protect the rights of both Australian factory workers and home workers, who are also known as outworkers. Outworkers are particularly vulnerable and isolated, as their work is often unregulated and hidden. They face unrealistic deadlines, long working hours, irregular flows of work, and significant occupational health and safety issues.

We say so too should the Abbott government. Given that industry supports the ECA, why is the government ceasing funding to the ECA? What consultation, if any, occurred with the ECA prior to the budget announcement? Did the department consult with the industry department about the cut to the TCF Structural Adjustment Fund? Is the government aware of the impact the cut to ECA will have upon the industry? Won't funding cuts make it harder for ethical companies to survive and compete against those who do not meet such standards?

With the repeal of the Fair Work Principles, Ethical Clothing Australia also ended being funded, which will save about $1 million, and had so far been about a $7-million program.
                                                                                </p>

It was a combination of the union movement and business, but really was doing the job of the unionâpaying the union to do the job it was already supposed to do. If the purpose of unions is to protect workers, and one would hope that it is; if the purpose of unions is to make sure that workers are given fair salaries, emoluments and conditions, and I would expect that that is the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union's role, then Ethical Clothing Australia was really a subsidy to the union to do the job that it should already have been doing.
                                                                                </p>

Everyone needs to contribute to the savings that are necessary to bring the budget back into the black over time. The government inherited a $667-billion debtâit was rising to that figure if no action was taken. We inherited $123 billion of accumulated deficits and deficits as far as the eye can see. So programs that did the job that the union was already supposed to be doingânamely, protecting workers in the textiles, clothing and footwear sectorâwere deemed to be the kind of program you might have when you are running a surplus budget, as we did in the Howard government, running a $22-billion surplus in our final year in office. But when you are borrowing money from overseas to fund programs that are effectively a subsidy to the union, that is not a fair use of taxpayers' funds and for that reason we have not continued funding for it.

I would like to ask whether in fact the government contemplated whether there would be, as a result of this cut to expenditure in this sectorâa very modest level of expenditure when you think about it, $1 million from sector that employs tens of thousands of Australians: wont this cut lead to a reduction? I guess I am asking the government whether there has been any contemplation that this removal of a measureâby the way, a measure that has been embraced not just by unions but, as I said, by companies that I referred to earlierâa reduction in ethical production of clothing. This is a sector of our economy that is trade exposed. Indeed, there are bottom feeders in the sector that break the law and those reputable companies, along with unions that might represent workers, want to ensure that that conduct does not continue.

I put to the minister that there are concerns, therefore, that ethical production will reduce and as a result business will be lost in this country. I wonder whether in fact the government has in any way assessed or modelled the consequences of reducing what is in the end quite a modest amount of Commonwealth expenditure?

And therefore the money that the taxpayers have already expendedâthe $7 millionâcould probably have been better spent, given that the private sector has already agreed to replace that funding in order to ensure that there is an accreditation process in place.
                                                                                  </p>

I know that, when the Labor Party were in office, they did much of this support for the union, because they are obviously inextricably linked to the union movement. While I do not want to be critical of the member, he of course is a union boss himself from past times, as is his brother as well, and I can understand that Labor does like to use taxpayers' money to support the unions. But it is the unions' job to look after workers. For that, they collect subsidies and licences from their members and from businesses that want to be involved in their various programs, and they are the correct sources of funding for a program such as thisânot the Australian taxpayer.

It is an industry body that not only protects the workers but also, as I said earlier, protects reputable companies that are under pressure, as they are trade exposed. They are also under pressure from those rogue bottom-feeders that quite often undercut the standards, breach health and safety laws and do not pay lawful minimum rates of pay. So, when I met with this industry, I did not meet with the union alone; I met with reputable companies and the union to talk about these measures. I think it would be remiss of the government, and indeed the minister, not to understand that this is a measure that has been supported in the past by employers and employee organisations and indeed will be supported in future, no doubt.

This continues the trend of government members saying one thing in their electorates and completely the opposite thing in Canberra. The government-proposed changes to the FEG would see a maximum penalty for redundancy pay under the scheme set at 16 weeks, and indexation of a maximum weekly wage used in calculating entitlements.
                                                                                   </p>

However, like everything with this budget, there is a sinister, callous, unfair, hidden catch. The government has sought to hide how the change to the FEG intersects with cuts to the Automotive Transformation Scheme. If you combine the capping of the maximum benefit from a maximum of four weeks per year of service to a maximum of 16 weeks and the cuts to the Automotive Transformation Scheme, along with the government's dismantlement of the automotive sector in Australia, it spellsâwe would contendâdisaster for workers, particularly in the automotive industry.
                                                                                   </p>

Under the current scheme, they would be entitled to the FEG based on their years of serviceâfor example, 20. Under the government's scheme they will be entitled to 16 weeks maximum, irrespective of their service. We would contend that the government has overseen the death of the automotive manufacturing sector, which has dire consequences for the rest of the supply chain. And now, when workers will most need the assistance that the FEG offers, the government is seeking to rip that away. Everything that this government does, I would contend, has been to attack working conditions and workers. We therefore ask the ministerâwhichever minister at the table feels it is appropriate for them to answerâabout this matter. This is going to have a very significant impact on thousands of workers who are soon to lose their jobs pursuant to the announcements that have been made by companies like Holden and Toyota and pursuant to subsequent cuts that will arise from decisions by other companiesâand of course the consequential impacts to the automotive parts sector will lead to further redundancies.
                                                                                   </p>

What consultation was there with the companies, their work force and indeed unionsâif there was any consultationâabout the adverse impact of these measures? What explanation is the government providing to those workers who are to lose their jobs and now to lose a very significant level of support by cutting the threshold, or ceiling, to a maximum of 16 weeks?

Following the collapse of Ansett, the Howard government in 2001 initiated the GEER Scheme, the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, to ensure that workers were not placed in the position where, because of the collapse of a corporation, whether or not it was a major corporation, they lost their entitlements accumulated over many years. We will not go into the reasons why Ansett collapsed. Many people would blame the union movement for the featherbedding and the arrangements that they managed to eke out of the executives at Ansett over a very long time, making the airline utterly uneconomic. But rather than returning to that debate, which is now 15 years old, I would point out to the House that the GEER Scheme was the antecedent to the FEG scheme which Labor changed when they came into office.
                                                                                    </p>

It was the accepted standard throughout the period of the Howard government and then through five years of the Labor government. So for five years of the Labor government they thought 16 weeks was perfectly adequate and they kept the FEG scheme, as they renamed it, at a 16-week maximum.
                                                                                    </p>

That obviously led to a massive cost blowout for the Australian taxpayer. Yet again we see that the shadow minister was living a champagne lifestyle on a beer income. Obviously when you are running surplus budgets you are able to fund a champagne lifestyle on a champagne income, but you cannot keep borrowing money from overseas to pass it back to your union friends, as Mr Shorten did by removing that cap. It is coincidental, many would say, that the Leader of the Opposition was also a former union boss in the

Some would say that, in the dying days of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, many of the union's demands to the government of the time were met with the Greens allies in the Senate passing almost every proposal that the Labor Party put up to try and entrench union power. One of the things they did was to get rid of the 16-week cap on the GEER Scheme, which became the FEG scheme, and this government is returning the 16-week cap, which is the community standard. It will save $87.7 million over four years, and I think taxpayers will think that is a very fair use of their money.
                                                                                    </p>

They should be protected on what is the community standard. We should not be using government, as the previous government did, to support their union base in order to win votes in a leadership ballot. Therefore, I cannot imagine that the shadow minister's criticisms, while I am sure are probably good-natured, are genuine.

It is a time to ask questions about the budget. The government's response to the National Commission of Audit has already been published. Obviously, it is contained in the budget. The National Commission of Audit made a very wide range of recommendations to government, some of which were adopted in total, some of which were not adopted and some of which were adjusted and adopted in part. The National Commission of Audit did an excellent job in advising the government on how to try to repair the mess that the Labor Party left the budget in after six years.
                                                                                      </p>

The recommendations that have been adopted are clear from the budget.

I want to make clear that I too have my own perception of the history of entitlements. Indeed, Labor has a very clear understanding of how the entitlement scheme commenced under the Howard government. It may have commenced formally after the Ansett collapse. But of course, the first decision by the Howard government to provide entitlements to retrenched workers was when the Prime Minister intervened and provided some entitlements to National Textiles, a company of which the Prime Minister's brother,

I am just making it very clear that we do recall the prime minister at the time, Prime Minister Howard, making a decision that impacted and benefited only one company, a company of which his brother was director.

How many people will lose income as a result of reducing their retrenchment benefitsâhow many will be impacted? How much, on average, would each retrenched worker lose as a result of the cuts to this measure? And what explanation will the government provide the companies and the workers? Other than just attacking the opposition, I have not really had an answer to those questions. What is it that these workers have done wrong to lose the support of the government in their time of need?
                                                                                       </p>

I think that was a very, very dangerous and stupid thing to do. Now we are left with workers who are going to be unemployed for a period of time. Let us hope they find work quickly. But in the meantime, they had an expectation that, pursuant to the current arrangements, there would have been some support. That has been torn away. Yet we have not heard how the people will miss out, how much money has been taken per capita, and what it will mean for those workers.
                                                                                       </p>

This is about the workforce, not the Labor Party and not the government; it is about the workforce that will be retrenched and the fact that they will lose this entitlement because of the decision by the government to cut this measure in the budget.

But to answer his questions: he also raised, of course, the issue of the car industry and the manufacturing sector. Well, I did not hear him saying that somehow the Labor government was to blame for the closure of Mitsubishi or the closure of Ford and that the policies that Labor tried to support at that time, of massive government subsidies to the car industry, did not save Ford and they did not save Mitsubishi.
                                                                                        </p>

Trying to frighten the workers of Holden or Toyota through rhetoric today when, in fact, his own government did not save that Mitsubishi Ford has rather a hollow ring to it.

And because I am a generous man, and in spite of it not being estimates, I am also prepared to tell him that pausing the indexation of the maximum weekly wage will affect around 588 claimants each year. I assume that he has now run out of material, but if he has not I am prepared to keep answering questions.

On budget night, of course, we heard about the government's new measure for those young people under the age of 30 who would be on Newstart; who are in stream 1 and stream 2 and who would be without a Newstart payment for six months. I think the government is calling it 'a non-payment period' of Newstart for six months for those job seekers under 30 who are in those streams. We also heard in estimates that it is possible that penalties will apply to people during these six months and that there will be an activity test. I am particularly keen for the minister to outline to us what evaluation has been done and whether or not this will lead to better job outcomes? I would like the minister to confirm whether or not that six months could actually be up to several months longer, because penalties could be applied? And what would be the total amount of time that somebody might be without Newstart payment and would activities apply for that whole period of time that they are without payment?

We firmly believe that young people should either be earning or learning, or if they are not doing either of those things they should be involved in some form of mutual obligation. We believe that we need to encourage young people at every opportunity to get and keep a job.
                                                                                           </p>

Now, if a young person is without work they have the option to be engaged in an appropriate training program. That can enhance their employment prospects. We believe that is a very important thing, that young people have the skills to get into work.
                                                                                           </p>

The measures that the government announced are mindful of the fact that many job seekers face different circumstances. The measures that were announced apply only to those most job-ready job seekers and consideration is given to people in positions, such as principal carer for parents, people with a partial work capacityâthose more disadvantaged job seekers known, as you would know as formerly being in this sectorâstreams 3 and 4,

We recently implemented our Job Commitment Bonus, encouraging young people to get and keep a job. That is a very good program because it gives young people a bonus of some $2Â½ thousand if they get off welfare, get into a job and stay in a job for a period of 12 months. If they stay off welfare for a further period of 12 months, there is a further bonus of $4,000 payable. That is potentially $6Â½ thousand to encourage young people into work.

That is very important. We understand the fact that many people, if they have been on benefits, can be struggling financially and the cost of moving to a new location to take up a job could be prohibitive. We have an enhanced Relocation Assistance Program to encourage young people to move to where the jobs are.

Hopefully that employee would be a young person. And then we have Work For the Doleâa very important program which can give young people the skills they need, the very basic skills that so many employers are telling me are lacking in the job seekers who present at the gates of their business. We have a range of measures that are aimed at assisting young people into work.
                                                                                           </p>

We believe that the very best thing we can do is to prevent young people from drifting out of school into the despair of long periods of welfare. That is why we are absolutely focused on these types of programs. The very best thing we can do to create opportunities for young job seekers is to grow a strong economy. That is why we handed down a budget just recently in the House that set Australia up for the future and invested in the future rather than pursue the path of members opposite, which was to spend for today. Yet the members opposite are standing in the way of a budget that can create the sort of economic growth and job opportunities that young people need.
                                                                                           </p>

Government programs have a role to playâthey certainly have their placeâbut nothing can create jobs and nothing can create opportunities more effectively than a strong economy.

I asked: have you done an evaluation about whether or not these programs will work and whether your measures will work for people under the age of 30? You are talking about people who would be under the age of 30. Some of them already have an education and some of them may already have completed an apprenticeship, but the factory might have closed down, their employer might have made people redundant and, through no fault of their own, they are out of work. They may already have skills and a degree, and you are saying to them that, if they cannot find a job within six months, they have to do

Can the minister also tell me, as I asked in my original question, whether the activity tests are required during the period when they will be without payment? How on earth does the government expect job seekers with no money to complete activity tests and apply for up to 40 jobs per month?

What employers were telling me was that the job services system was not meeting their needs. What the job service providers were telling me was that they were so bound up in red tape that they were being diverted from their main task, which is getting people into work. They were so busy with Labor's red tape that the system had become a form-filling exercise rather than an exercise in bringing job seekers together with employers. We have already made a range of announcements reducing red tape that has been a burden on job service providers. What we are proposing to have done and the process we propose to continue is to strip away the red tape, make the job services system more effective, allow them to offer better services to job seekers and improve the prospects for employment.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              So I say to the shadow minister that, absolutely, job seekers will be required to leave no stone unturned to get a job. That is the purpose. A life of welfare is not something that any young person would aspire to. We are working with them, we are working with job service providers. We want to get them into work.

The principle of mutual obligation commenced in the early nineties under Working Nation in the Keating years. It was embraced fully by the Howard government. Mutual obligationânamely, that undertakings are expected of job seekers and in receipt of those undertakings being complied with a modest income would be providedâhas been a bipartisan position for more than 20 years. That in receipt of a modest level of income to provide modest support for people, there would be an expectation to fulfil requirements, including of course, firstly, to look for work, but also to engage in activities that would increase the likelihood of that job seeker finding employment. What the assistant minister has now just said is that, notwithstanding the fact that young people under the age of 30 who are job seekers and are work ready will be expected to fulfil requirements, they will not get any support of a financial nature from this government. That, I would say to this place, is the tearing up of a compact between the Commonwealth and job seekers that has been in existence and has been bipartisan for more than 20 years. The compact is, of course, the principle of mutual obligation. You are provided some modest level of support and in doing so you must fulfil your obligations to look for work.
                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                               Labor has always believed that if you receive an income like Newstart to look for work you must look for work. I as the former minister in this area believed if you do not look for work and had no reasonable excuse in not looking for work your income could well be suspended and should be suspended until you re-engage. This minister, however, seems to think it is quite okay for the Commonwealth to abrogate their responsibility to Australian job seekers by providing no support for the first six months and yet require those same job seekers to undertake activities. So I ask the assistant minister two questions in light of that. Firstly, does he believe that the principle of mutual obligation continues, even though for those job seekers under the age of 30, they will receive nothing for six months, even if they look for work every day, every week, every month for six months? The second question I would like to put to him is: given that the

I would like to know the answer to that. Firstly, why are you tearing up the principle of mutual obligation?

What I will say is that within these measures, and they are detailed, is that if a young person engages in training they will still be eligible for youth allowance, so there is support for those people engaged in training. For those people who have a work history there is a discount offered against the preclusion period, so for those with a work history who have contributed, the period will be less than six months.

As I said earlier, when I get around I have employers telling me that young people lack the important skills, those basic skills, that they need to get by in the workplace: simple skills such as turning up on time, having the right attitude, working with colleaguesâthe sorts of skills that we all take for granted if we have been in the workplace for some time. Unfortunately, many young people, perhaps those who have grown up in a household where there is intergenerational unemployment, lack those basic skills. Work for the Dole offers a great opportunity for young people to achieve those skills.

You are confusing two concepts. What is in the budget relates to phase 1 of Work for the Dole, which is 18 locations around the country with a Work for the Dole program being offered to people between 18 and 30 who will be required to do up to 15 hours a week for a six-month period. It is a very important program that we are rolling out and one that we intend to roll out carefully and methodically.

They said they had had trouble getting up in the morning to attend Work for the Dole for the first couple of weeks of the program, but when they got into the swing of things it gave them a reason to get out of bed.

I will read some of the points. The survey was of 1,151 businesses and it was done by my department. The employers said that making basic adjustments to their attitude and physical presentation is the most effective thing that many young job seekers can do to improve their employment prospects. That is a very important point and I will repeat it: making adjustments to their attitude and physical presentation is the most effective thing that many young job seekers can do to improve their prospects. The survey was quite interesting with regard to a range of attributes: 39 per cent of respondents said that improving attitude would be a very important element; 14 per cent said improving reliability and responsibility; 11 per cent said physical presentation.

Not only is the young person learning valuable skills; they are able to contribute to their community, they are able to build self-esteem, they are able to walk away from a program at the end of the six months with a resume or a reference to give to an employer and say, 'This is what I've done, this is what I've achieved, I've had experience in these particular areas'âbe it paving or painting or perhaps some construction activity such as building a walkway. They can go to an employer and say, 'I've contributed to my community, I've worked as part of a team, I know what it takes to be in the workplace.' These are the sorts of skills that Work for the Dole can bring. We believe in the program very much, and we believe in the benefits that it can impart to young people.

To give some recent statistics from the Coffs-Grafton employment statistics area, I am very pleased to say that the unemployment rate in February this year was 10.4 per cent and by March it had dropped to 7.3 per cent. These figures are in the minister's area. In our area, in the electorate of Lyne, just below Cowper, the unemployment rate should be helped by a jobs drive we undertook with Job Service providers, when more than 320 jobs were flushed out of the system and are now out there being advertised. Hopefully we will see a similar drop in statistics. My question for Minister Hartsuyker is: what initiatives have we got in the recent budget to help mature-age workers to gain employment?

The discussion to this point has largely focused on younger workers, but it is a very important element that, just as we do not want young people to move from school and descend into a life of welfare, we do not want older workers to exit the workforce prematurely. We need their skills and experience in the workforce; they have a great contribution to make. I think that all entities benefit from having a spread of workers in their business, from young people starting out their working career to wise heads who can add the voice of experienceâand experience is something that only comes with time.
                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                                  I am pleased to say that in the budget we announced the Restart Program, which is a very strong commitment to encouraging businesses to employ older workers, because we know that they have a great deal to give. Our more senior workers bring a depth of experience, they bring a depth of skills that can only be achieved with time. The program provides incentives of up to $10,000 to encourage businesses to take on older workers and to retain them in their business, because as our population ages we need to ensure that we engage older workers in the workforce for as long as possible. The Restart Program is a huge commitment by this government in the budget.
                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                                  But the very best thing we can do to create opportunities for workers, young and old alike, is to grow a strong economyâand that is what the budget attempted to do, that is what the budget plans to do. Unfortunately, I must report that we have the members opposite standing in the way of the very measures that are going to build that strong economy; standing in the way of repaying Labor's debt; standing in the way of getting our budget back in the black. We have the members opposite who feign concern for young job seekers and feign concern for older job seekers, but they continue to stand in the way. As I said earlier, the challenge coming up for these members is to pass the repeal of the carbon tax and to pass the repeal of the mining tax. Nothing can grow jobs faster and better than a strong economy. Programs such as Restart and our programs for younger peopleâyes, they have their place, but there is no substitute for a strong economy.

It was a highly effective program in the Howard years, and Labor has allowed the program to run down. We are reinvigorating Work for the Dole. I announced phase 1 in 18 locations around the country. It would be available to young long-term unemployed people, aged between 18 and 30, for about 15 hours a week, for a period of six months.
                                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                                    The purpose of Work for the Dole is to allow people to contribute to their community and to learn new skills. There will be a number of placements: the traditional team-based placement, which I think most members of the public would be familiar with, where a team would perhaps be constructing a walkway or a cycle path or perhaps repainting a community hall. We are also seeking hosted placements, where job seekers might be hosted by a not-for-profit organisation. It could be a local council or it could be an aged-care facilityâquite clearly not involved in delivering care to residents within that facilityâjob seekers working in ancillary functions, whether it is maintenance or repairs, whether it is assisting in some other element of the non-caring side, if you like, of the aged-care facility.
                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                    As I get around the country, people are very supportive of Work for the Dole. One job services provider said to me that more than half the participants exit the program after obtaining ongoing paid employment. Isn't that a great outcome? The same provider reported that another of their Work for the Dole programs saw 12 individual placements at three employers, with all 12 participants exiting the program for paid employment. So we have a team of 12 all getting a job. That is great news.

This is the attitude that the government wishes to support. And it is a very prevalent one. These sorts of comments are repeated time and time again.

That is why the government is so keen to reinvigorate the program. It will be rolled out in a measured and efficient way, so that we can give young people the benefit of work experience in a Work for the Dole program, so they can enjoy the benefits of work while getting into a job, rather than languishing on welfare.

With all due respect to the minister, the 18 sites mean that the large majority of Australia will not have a Work for the Dole program. I am very curious as to what will happen to those young peopleâunder 30, in stream 1 or 2, that will be required after six months to do Work for the Doleâwhen there is no Work for the Dole program in their local area. What is going to happen to these people?
                                                                                                    </p>

Does the minister accept that evaluation of Work for the Dole has shown that only 35 per cent of participants end up in full-time paid employment after participating in Work for the Dole? Of course 35 per cent coming out and getting a full-time job is better than nobody getting a full-time job, and the minister referred to the fact that job creation and finding people jobs is the real solution to this.
                                                                                                    </p>

Parts of my home state of Tasmania have youth unemployment of over 20 per cent. Does the minister accept that there are no jobs there for these people most of the time and that the evaluation shows that the majority of them will not end up in full-time paid employment? Can he tell me what is happening to those people under 30 who are not in a Work for the Dole site and who will be required to mandatorily participate?

Let me say that what I have announced is just phase 1 of our rollout of Work for Dole. I say to the shadow minister that we will be making further announcements in due course. I was interested in her concern for job creationâand that is a very important point. We on this side of the House are absolutely concerned about job creation, so I put the question to her: why doesn't she help us repeal the carbon tax so we can create more jobs for Tasmanians?

Our international competitors, the competitors that Tasmanian dairy are having to compete against, do not pay a carbon tax.

Despite the high level of youth unemployment and the fact that Tasmania has the highest unemployment in the country, the dairy industry is struggling to find interest from young Tasmanians, so I and my department have been working with the dairy industry to encourage job seekers to take up the opportunities that exist in dairy.

I hope you explain to your constituents that because you are too weak to stand up for them the dairy industry is going to have to pay a carbon tax. You should say to them: 'Because of me dairies are paying thousands upon thousands of dollars in carbon tax. Because of me the processors are paying tens and tens of thousands in extra tax that the competitors to Tasmanian dairy do not have to pay.' It seems passing strange that members opposite could be endlessly feigning concern for the young unemployed while at the same time standing in the way of the very measures that are going to create opportunities. We are all about creating opportunities. We are about getting young people into work. We are mindful of the benefits that Work for the Dole can bring. We do not sit on our hands and quote reports that are 15-plus years old, which you are. You are resting on old-time reports based on a very early version of the scheme. We are about bringing in a work-for-the-dole scheme that will give young people the skills that they need to get into a job that contributes to the community at the same time. We are about opportunities on this side of the House. They are about standing in the way.

The brutal reality of the hollow force bequeathed by successive Labor governmentsâRudd, Gillard, Rudd againâlaid bare time after time. It was laid bare from the end of the Hawke-Keating era, which we saw in 1999. It is laid bare now. Some say history does not repeat itself. I guarantee you: when it comes to defence and Labor's mismanagement, it repeats itself time and time again.

That is what hangs over their heads in abject shame. That is what will be written on their political epitaph, etched in stone how the Labor Party considers the Defence Force. All in all, Labor cut $25 billion of the defence budget, including $5.5 billion in 2012-13 alone.

We promised before the election we would take the budget back to two per cent of GDP within a decade. The problem is that when the Howard government lost government in 2007, the Defence budget wasâgive or takeânear enough to two per cent. It took six wretched years to destroy it and there are 10 long years ahead to put it back again.

It is $9 million more than Labor provided. The funding includes $436.8 million in 2014-15 and $669.4 million across the forward estimates for the continuation of the operations in the

It is a commendable start to getting back to two per cent of GDP. The ADF Gap Year has started, ADF free housing has started and we have indexed DFRDB, on which I will have more to say. We have, in the first year, put all of our commitments into play. It is a stark contrast to the years of Labor.

I do have a question for the assistant minister, but I will put it into a little bit of context first. I would first like to put on the record my thanks for the wonderful work that the men and women of our ADF do in securing the defence of this nation in a variety of theatres around the world but also here onshore. I think that they do a tremendous, tremendous job.

Could the minister please, given Labor's failed history of budgetary decisions in relation to Defence, explain how releasing a 10-year capability review for our Defence Force is going to help build and restore not only the confidence of the Australian people in our Defence Force but more importantly restore the confidence of our serving men and women? That is, restore their capability to carry out their duty and the capability of Defence to do what needs to do to protect this nation and help others around the world, as we do in many strategic partnerships.

He is a man who understands the impacts of budgetary needs. He is someone who works very hard in his electorate to ensure that his people are well-served and that those who serve our country and have served in the pastâour veteran communityâare well taken care of. The member for Forde is someone who campaigned relentlessly to see DFRDB indexed in the appropriate and proper manner, all of which has been done. That indexation starts in 13 days. I thank the member for Forde for his continuing advocacy.

The failure is extreme. You are cutting $25 billion in the budget and it has to be cut from somewhere. In the defence scheme of things, you normally have a third of your operating costs for personnel, a third for the day-to-day operations and a third in terms of future capability. Under Labor's cuts, future capability dropped down below 20 per cent. It was 18 to 19 per cent of the budget.
                                                                                                           </p>

It is the biggest cutback in projects we have seen in the modern age. Let us look at the projects cancelled: ADF Joint Command Support Environment, operational imagery and geospatial support, identity management, joint non-lethal capabilities, replacement air targets, combat identification for land forces and long-range persistent subsurface detection capability.

Future artillery ammunition was delayed. Soldier Enhancement Version 2âLethality: that is something we would like to see delayed, isn't it! That is the lethality of what our soldiers actually use. The list goes on; it goes on for pages and pages of what has been delayed by the Labor Party.

We are not going to cut more than 100 projects of defence capability like Labor did. Labor put together Force 2030, which is a force structure that would be delivered and fully capable by 2030. We are not going to cut it and gut it like they did, and push it out into the 'force never-never'. We will work closely to ensure it is done. Under the Howard government, jobs in the defence industry doubled; under this last wretched government, jobs disappeared by 10 per cent. As the economy grew, jobs disappeared by 10 per cent.

Under Labor, the defence industry was denied the ability to undertake long-term planning because the defence capability planning under them was not worth the paper it was on. Even when they released the 2013 Defence white paper, they did not approve another defence capability planâit was not approved. They spent money from it, but the Minister for Defence never approved it. That is complete and utter disregard.
                                                                                                           </p>

What we had was a 2013 white paper; no force structure review; no planning for industry; no capability planning at all. But then again, what do you expect from a minister like Minister Smith, who never once went to a graduation at

He went to Russell three timesâthree times the defence minister went there. But then again, under Labor there were three defence ministers, and in total for the ministerial team for defence, there were 15 reshuffles. I think the best was Senator Carr, who was the Minister for Defence Procurement for less than 15 weeks. That is how Labor treated defence; that is how they treated the defence planning; that is how they treated the defence capability planning; that is how they treated defence industryâwith contempt.

And, I would hazard a guess, your white paper, which I think is due in April of next year. So I would like to hear from you on the question of 12 new submarines, because the clarity with which you went to the last election has of course disappeared into a miasma of fog since you won office.

He talked about a MOTS design and those also being options that were put before government. So what is the status of government searching for a MOTS design, in particular from those three nations?

As the minister would be awareâbut, no doubt, it is something he does not want talk aboutâthese were productive conversations that we had with the Japanese while the government. We welcome the fact that those discussions are continuing.
                                                                                                            </p>

He has spoken of propulsion systems and other systems, and there has also been canvassed the idea that we would buy a MOTS design from Japan. There are a lot of obvious challenges with that, but can the minister please advise the parliament what the government's intention is with respect to the Soryu class submarines from Japan? Can he rule out the fact that we would not purchase a MOTS design from Japan?

In fact, the Minister for Defence announced that by April of this year he would have a plan to bridge the 'valley of death'. He has at various moments canvassed the idea of building a fourth air warfare destroyer but in office has ruled that out. He has at various moments canvassed the idea of replacement Armidales but, again, we have no concrete decision. And then in more recent days he described as 'an exciting announcement' the announcement that the two replacement oilers would be wholly built overseas in either Korea or Spain, and that local shipyards were to be excluded from the opportunity to bid for that work. He has denigrated the shipbuilding industry; he has said that the shipbuilding industry in this country is not capable of building those vesselsâthat it does not have the capacity to build those vessels. Can he please advise us how it is that that commitment has come to nothingâto ash? How is it that he is going to bridge the 'valley of death'?

Leave a complete disaster and then question why we have not fixed it! I can see the Labor Party: they are like coming home and your flatmate has trashed the house and is lying blind drunk on the sofa. You walk in and start to clean up the mess and then the drunkard rolls into his own vomit on the floor, wakes up and gets cross at you for cleaning the house and wants to know why it has not been done! Well, thank you very much, member for Batman! Let us go through each of your claims one by one to unpack the hilarity of the wall. Let us look at the fog that you talk about.
                                                                                                             </p>

If it had actually stuck to the plan there would be no need to extend Collins. But what did Labor do? Nothing. Nothingâin fact, they did nothing for 4Â½ years. Four years! And because of this Labor was forced to move the initial operating capability by four years to 2029â30. It also took about $20 billion out during the same time. That was their commitmentâwrong! That was Labor's commitment to 12 submarines.
                                                                                                             </p>

We will deliver an affordable, deliverable white paper. Labor's legacy 2009 white paper: completely unaffordable. One and a half pages of scant financial detailâpie in the sky. The 2013 white paper: no force structure review, no defence capability plan attached to it and no funding attached to it.

The idea that we would be lectured by the Labor Party on national security is simply hilarious. We will ensure that Australia has the military capabilities to deter threats and to project forward in our neighbourhood. We will actually do the hard work that Labor has delayed.

Really? I think Minister Johnston was the very first Defence minister actually to go to Japan and start a conversation seriously about what cooperation we could possibly have. Labor made a commitment with little data to back it up and then did nothing and created an operational gap. We will fix it up, as we do with everything Labor does in Defence. We will clean up the mess that the drunkards have made while they still look hung-over on the couch. When it comes to shipbuilding and the 'valley of death', I say this is hilarious. What did Labor do in government? Your last election commitment for Defenceâ

This was a grand bargain, which had two parties. On the government side, we were going to provide three per cent growth in real terms from 2009, the time of the white paper, to 2017-18. From that point on, 2017-18 to 2030, which was the name of the white paper, it was going to be 2.2 per cent growth in real terms. I think the benevolent government of the day even promised some certainty with respect to indexation of the money it was going to provide Defence. That was what the government promised to do, to deliver that certainty and that reliability.

You know you go to war with the gear you have, and in 1999 we did not have the gear we needed. And the coalition vowed that that would not happen again. The problem we face now is that we do not have the gear we need. The grand bargain of Labor providing three per cent real increase in the Defence budget 2017-18 and then a modicum less than that to the out years to deliver Force 2030 was not deliveredâit was not followed through.

That is the situation as a statement of fact. That was the level of debilitating impact that we had in the defence budget. That is what we have to deal with; $25 billion was taken out and it will take 10 years to get that money back. This budget is a good startâover $29 billion. We have taken the spend as a proportion of GDP back to 1.8 per cent from where it was at 1.56 per cent.

Forty-six per cent of all projectsâfuture capability and future force structureâwere delayed, deferred or cut but, 'There's nothing to see here! There's no impact on capability.' It is simply and utterly laughable.

This budget has started that process. The Defence white paper that we will deliver next year will be ruthlessly costed and ruthlessly budgeted. For what we say we can afford, you will be able to see where the money is coming from. You cannot speak strategy without speaking dollars and cents. The problem with the last Labor government is that they would speak grand strategyâgrand moving handsâbut they could not back it up. They refused to back it up with dollars and cents.

They gave defence three hours to bill $1 billion out so that their budget would have a surplus. Five hundred times the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said that a surplus would be delivered, but what were we left with? A $51 billion deficit. That is the legacy of Labor.

As you would well and truly comprehend, having in recent months thrown the Australian car industry overboard and abandoned it merrily to its fate, there are now significant automotive workforces in the northern suburbs of Adelaide and in Geelong that spring to mind who are looking to see whether LAND 400 might provide them with opportunities going forward. You, of course, must be aware of the fact that the city of Geelong has run quite robust campaign promoting its virtues as a destination for investment in LAND 400. Curiously enough, the Ford plant in Geelong was originally built to construct tanks in World War

Can you tell us when we can expect to see first pass approval? Has the scope and capability requirements for LAND 400 been varied since this matter was previously reported? Can you tell us how the vehicles you are now proposing to acquire under LAND 400? Does it continue to be 1100 vehicles or has that number been decreased? Can you also tell us whether you are envisaging that LAND 400 will acquire a vehicle able to carry, say, 11 persons, or are you imagining a vehicle that is of less capability than that? Perhaps you can also tell us how our traditional partners, and in particular the United States and the United Kingdom, might be in a position to collaborate with us in searching for a fifth generation armoured vehicle.

It will include a tracked light infantry vehicle to replace the current 1113, albeit, upgraded but still of Vietnam vintage. That, of course, will be able to lift a combat element of a battalion. It will have a track manoeuvre support vehicle that enables battlefield groups to cross obstaclesâbridging, mine clearingâand of course an integrated training system. The shadow minister is right: it is a substantial project, the biggest one Army will actually deliver, of some $10 billion. It will go to first pass this year. From first pass, we will ensure that over the coming years the capability is procured. So that, when the ASLAV reaches its end of lifeâthe ASLAV is our first infantry fighting vehicleâwe will have the new vehicle, and there will be no operational gaps.

It is a substantial project. We are looking for industry to deliver as many innovative solutions as they possibly can.

It does not mean we cannot develop it in Australia in terms of build, but we need to be able to reach out and touch and see that vehicle. We will need to be able to see how the battle management system is integrated the current battle management system under LAND 75 as part of that.

It needs to give the government half a chance to maximise the work that we do in Australia. But it is going to come down to Australian industry to ensure they put forward bids that maximise their opportunity. It is going to require some innovation. I have already had discussions with local councils, with state governments and with a range of primes to ensure that message of taking an innovative approach is well and truly there.

Why were you prejudiced against local industry?' Of course he had no answer.

The money we pushed the then government to use was then used in part by Thales to produce Hawkei, which is now the manufactured and supported in Australia option.

So my first question will be related to that: what are we doing with respect to that indexation promise?

You promised at the last election and you are opposing it. That is amazing! There was a promise from Labor in 2007. There was a promise in 2010 from the member for Eden-Monaro. There was a promise in 2013. Has it been delivered in this budget?

It is well known also, although they have the discretion not to go and give it in a press conference, our US allies have been very concerned about that.

And, with respect to the pivot to Asia, the US has been very concerned about the cut by the last government, the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, of $25 billion to forward estimates for defence expenditure. Can the minister give us an update on the views of our US ally about the reversal of those cuts to the defence budget?

It would leave the electorate of Eden-Monaro and move up the coast, probably to Queensland. I am wondering if you have a comment about that with respect to the defence budget, Minister.

He is someone who stands up for his community very strongly. He is a very loud, clear and cogent voice. He is someone whose advice and counsel I receive quite regularly.

We took to the last election a very strong DFRDB policy. It was supported very strongly by those here on this side of the Houseâthe member for Bass, the member for Brisbane, the member for Ryan and the member for Eden-Monaro. They were vociferous in their support for it. Labor's 2007 election document said that a Rudd Labor government would maintain a generous military superannuation system in recognition of the importance of the ADF. But then what did they do? Nothing. They put in place the Matthews review, which was designed to ensure that the full indexation of DFRDB did not occur. That is what they held onto.
                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                           Three times in this House we put up private members' bills and other bills to successfully get it through. Every time the member for Batman and the member for Werriwa opposite voted against it. They had a chance to step up, but they voted against it. We took it to the election again. I remember standing there with many of my colleagues here. We took it to the election again and had overwhelming endorsement. We then legislated it through the House. Many of those around here spoke well of it. It went through the Senate. It passed the House of Representatives and the Senate and, as a result, in 13 days, when it takes effect on 1 July, 57,000 DFRDB and DFRB superannuants will be better off. That includes 813 retired Defence Force members in the member for Eden-Monaro's electorate. He stood up for 813 retired Defence Force members and achieved that indexation. This is an initiative that has been a long time coming, and I am pleased to report that the budget fulfils the financial requirements of the government. We have put the welfare of our people and their families first, alongside free ADF health care, alongside bringing back things like the ADF gap year and other programsâwe are putting our people first. The coalition's policy applies to those aged 55 and over, and takes indexation in line with

And that was the problem. The welfare budget went through the roof whilst defence was cut and cut and cut again to meet Labor's misguided priorities. We will not do that as a governmentâwe will stand up for what is right; we will be consistent and we will be disciplined. We will have a structured planning process; a structured force structure review; a budgetary process that connects to that, and we will have a defence force our nation can be proud of.

The DSTO, of course, is an organisation that has an extraordinary record, and does this country very proud indeed. The DSTO has worked with partners across defence industries and, indeed, has worked very successfully with organisations right around the world.

Can he please advise how that $50 million cut over the forward estimates is going to impact on the work of DSTO? What is that going to mean for the participation of the DSTO in overseas collaborations? What is that going to mean for the DSTO in programs and research that is presently underway? How is it, amidst all of your flummery around the defence budget, that such critically important capabilities that flow from the work of the DSTO can be ignored? Are we going to see significant job lossesâstaff losses? And what about facilitiesâobviously, the DSTO works very successfully out of a number of facilities. Are any of those slated for your rather dramatic and inflated plans regarding releasing defence estate?

Let me be clear about cuts to DSTO and where they fall, and let us look at this factually, because, unfortunately, the former Parliamentary Secretary for Defence in the last government has been found out. Despite promising an extra $138 million for DSTO at the 2010 electionâthat was Labor's promiseâbetween 2011-12 and 2012-13 in the PBS, Labor cut the DSTO budget by $22.2 million. That is the Labor legacy fact.
                                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                                             In the PBS again, Labor ripped an additional $22 million from DSTO in the 2013-14 budgetâthat is a factâand, in its last year in office, Labor ripped $106 million from DSTO, as we discovered in the additional estimates released in October 2013. So I am happy to talk about cuts, because the last three cuts at DSTO have come from the previous Labor government. It is because of Labor's successive cuts that DSTO has been forced to reduce its staff to balance its books. That is Labor's legacy; they are the facts and they are not disputed. This is another example of the mess that has been left. Any suggestion that these cuts belong to this government is farcical.

All members of parliament were recently invited to experience what it would be like to fly one of the new joint strike fighter 35s, and it was quite amazing for those who took up the offer. I am told by pilots in the veteran community that it is like flying a computer desk compared to how they used to fly planes. I think every one of us who availed ourselves of that opportunity understood the amazing capability that it has. Could you elaborate on why that is the best and right choice, and the flow-on benefits to Australian industry?

In working with our other nine partners across the world, 10 nations will be taking delivery of this aircraft. That will be somewhere around 3Â½ thousand planesâit goes up and down as different countries vary their intake of jets. We are not just buying a plane that is an orphan; we are buying into the most sophisticated platform available for an advanced fifth-generation fighter. We are talking seriously significant fighter power in terms of flying computers, if you like; an ability not to be seen, but to see a long way out. This is about ensuring our legacy for the future.

The Minister for Defence, the Honourable Brendan Nelson, made that decision, and he was vilified and rubbished by the Labor government, can I say. But they made a tough decision, a decision that the past Labor government then acknowledged begrudgingly was indeed the right one to ensure that there was no capability gap.

This is what good alliance partners do and good purveyors of the public purse when it comes to Defence. We make a promise; we stick by it. We say to our alliance partners, 'We will stump up with you in the development of this', and we have done it. Subsequently, Australian companies now have access to a whole range of opportunities to produce supporting gear and bits and pieces for the aircraft. Currently, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of work, with extensive work still coming, is available for those with the

It is one thing for him to keep delaying comment until the first principles review has reported, but these matters require assurance and we need assurance now. I ask the assistant minister: has the government committed at least to maintaining the current levels of staffing in key areas such as intelligence, scientific research and technical work? How can it reassure us that we will have in place measures to ensure that staffing decisions taken will fully incorporate the need to maintain operational capability support provided by civilian staff? Also, prior to the election, the coalition said it would cut 12,000 Public Service jobs through natural attrition. Can the minister assure Defence civilian staff that their jobs will be cut through natural attrition?

Seriously, it is a bit rich being lectured on this by the member for Canberra. We know that Labor cut and planned by stealth to cut 14,500 jobs. We know thatâthe numbers are clear. It was clearly demonstrated on the floor of the Houseâa cut by 14,500. I did not hear the member for Canberra out there clanging the bells when Labor was looking at cutting that. We did not see the member for Canberra on the barricades. Did anyone? Never. Labor cut 2,800 jobs in Defence alone. Did you get a splinter on the barricades, Member for Canberra, when you stood there standing up with your constituents?

Another 1,000 APS Defence jobs were cut in the 2012-13 budget. Member for Canberra, what were your public statements then? Silence? That's right. In the 2013-14 budget, another 800 public servants were cut. Member for Canberra, what were your public statements then? Oh that's rightâsilence. Over three years, the loud roar of silence was absolutely deafening! And Senator Conroy, accusing us of cutting 2,000 ADF personnel. If he had only read Budget Paper No.2âand I would refer the member for Canberra to that budget paperâhe would note that there are only 1,200 APS reductions. And unlike Labor, we are fully reinvesting those funds in Defence.

As of 22 May, there were 20,137 full-time; a reduction of 843. In 2014-15 there will be a further reduction of 600 from 20,300 full-time employees at the end of 2013-14, to a target of 19,700 full-time; and Defence is forecast to be 18,105 full-time. These reductions are made possible by continuing reforms to our business practice; in particular, the wider application of shared services. Reform within Defence is being implemented to ensure there are no reductions in critical service standards or capability, especially to defence members deployed on operations.

Other measures include amendments to the backdating of the disability pension claim for the disability pension to paid on the date the claim is lodged for claims received on or after 1 January 2015, and backdating provisions for veterans' entitlements, like war widows. There will be an increase in the number of enhanced compliance program reviews per year from 12,000 to 20,000; these additional reviews are aimed at ensuring clients are receiving the level of income support they are entitled to, and will focus on clients who are at high risk of change to their circumstances.

There will be annual indexation of the income threshold for Commonwealth Seniors Health Card by the CPI that will occur from 20 September 2014; and from 1 July the Clean Energy Supplement will be known as the Energy Supplement, and the payment will no longer be indexed as, frankly, the carbon tax will be removed and will no longer contribute to price pressures.

It is a very strong message, it is a very clear message: no pensions will be cut by the budget. From 17 July pensions will be indexed by CPI and will be continue to be indexed twice every year, March and September. It is worth recognising that the increase in pensions paid in March this year was an increase due to CPI. Further changes that were legislated to DFRDB and DFRDB military superannuants will continue beyond 2017 and will be unaffected by any other changes made to government pension payments. At the last election the government had a clearly defined policy agenda for veterans and their families. We will be implementing our commitments and we will be keeping faith with our veterans.

You have spoken in an earlier session around defence, Minister, about the virtue of not robbing Peter to pay Paul. Let us stick to that theme, because you have spoken virtuously about the government's policy with respect to DFRDB and the 59,000 persons that it affects. Let us now talk about the 280,000 peopleâthe veterans, the war widows and the orphansâwho will be hit by this government's new indexation system concerning pension cuts.

The current indexation system sees these pensions increase by the best of three indexation systems. CPI does not on average perform as well as these other indexation systems. That, of course, is something with which you would be very familiar, given the fact that you have wandered Australia promoting your DFRDB policy. How now can you explain your changed reasoning with respect to this indexation decisionâas I say, affecting some 280,000 Australians on veterans pensions and some 310,350 veterans pension payments?

Let me first of all deal with the budget. The Veterans' Affairs budget for this government this year was exactly the same as forecast by Laborâexactly the same. Forget the hyperbole and the hypocrisy of a '$107 million' cut; it was exactly the same. Secondly, where was Labor's 2013 election policy for veterans? That's right, they didn't have one. So to come in here and lecture the coalition on veterans policies, when Labor could not even be bothered to get off that couch in a drunken stupor and put together a veterans' affairs policy is a long, long bow to draw.

In fact, on 11 June, 2011, the member for Batman, who was then Senator Feeney, voted against us in the other place. Clearly, hypocrisy knows no bounds.

In opposition, the government campaigned to change the method of indexing DFRDB and DFRB superannuation schemes because we were convinced the existing arrangements were unjust. We have delivered on that commitment. We are proud of it. Those changes will not be taken away.
                                                                                                                                     </p>

Superannuation schemes are limited to a set number of members who make contributions from their salary and are entitled to draw on them. In the case of DFRDB, we are talking about a declining number of eligible members, in most cases with a 20-year service entitlement. Pension schemes are entirely different, because eligibility is not circumscribed in the same way and because recipients do not make any specific contributions. The government's changes to the indexation of pensions are necessary to ensure the pension system remains sustainable in the medium to long term. Age and service pensions will continue to increase twice a year. Every March, every September they will go up and purchasing power will be maintained through indexation of the CPI. This change will bring indexation into line for all social security payments.

Apparently on their trip to Damascus, they have had a change, a blinding light. The member for Lingiari, the former minister for defence personnel and veterans' affairs said in this House on 17 June that the matter of CPI indexation was reviewed by Matthews in 2008. He came to the view it was an appropriate method of indexationâ

There were four pillars included in that veterans' policy. At the head of it was the recognition of the unique nature of military service. I think by any measure that is readily apparent when you look at the spectrum of conflict that our military has been involved in over the last 20 or 30 years. I recall when I first joined the army. We were very focused on the defence of Australia. With that came the withering of land force capability. But what occurred over the next 20 or so years was an expansion of the sorts of things that we asked our Defence Force to do. This highlights the unique nature of that service. This includes everything from one end of the military spectrumâhumanitarian assistance, disaster relief and response to things like Fukushima,

The things that we ask our troops to do across that very broad spectrum are unique indeed. In my view it is absolutely appropriate that the unique nature of military service was one of those four pillars.

The third pillar is about supporting veterans through adequate advocacy and welfare services. That transition from department-led to bureaucracy-led advocacy and welfare for our veterans is absolutely vital. I hear from veterans in my community that sometimes that is where we do not do as well as we would like; when people leave the warm, soft, comfortable bosom of the

I would like to focus on what this budget delivers in terms of the key policy priority of tackling these mental health challenges. I note that much good work has been done, but there is more that can and should be done. Military operations over the last decade or so have resulted in what can only be described as the latest cohort of veterans. Some 72,000 ADF members have been deployed since 1999. It was with a great sense of pride that I welcomed my daughter back at the end of last year from her second tour of Afghanistan. She is part of that latest cohort of 72,000 ADF members. She is the only one of my three children to follow me into the military, but one I am very proud of. She joins that cohort, and I want to make sure that she is looked after into the future should she have needs that arise from her Defence service.

It is important to stress that this number is demand-driven; it is not capped. It is about need. It is about taking care of our people. DVA has adopted new approaches to communicating with and providing support to these veterans by increasingly using a range of online methodsâsocial media and mobile applications. The budget implements a range of initiatives focused on the mental health of our veterans, such as greater access to the VVCS for ex-members and their families.

It is the largest, most comprehensive program of study undertaken in Australia to understand the impact of military service on the mental, physical and social health of serving and ex-serving personnel and their families who have deployed to our contemporary conflicts.

We are investigating in the research ways to better understand the services and support needed by younger veterans and their families. Importantly, this research will not wait years. As each part of the project is completed it will be released. DVA and Defence will work together very closely. Improvements in how we work together will be made every time there is an opportunity to make them. Through the combined funding of this project between DVA and Defence we will get a greater understanding of issues of contemporary service and we will be able to identify strategies to deal with them.

This issue occurred over quite a period of time. In the lead-up to the 2007 election the Labor opposition committed to changing indexation for veterans' disability pensions and this was actually undertaken in the shadow of the election by the Howard government. I note that they made the change in around September 2007. It was one of the last acts of the Howard government. Now here, just after they have been elected, at the first available opportunity they have announced that they are changing that indexation system back. That is the first point.

That was a review into Commonwealth superannuation indexation methodology. You might also remember, Minister, that around the same time there was the Harmer review into social security payments and into, if you like, safety net payments within the social security system and with respect to veterans. In that review it was made very clear that changes were made to raise payments and to adjust further the indexation methodology beyond MTAWE and putting in place PBLCIâ

To recap briefly: Matthews was an inquiry into indexation methodology for Commonwealth superannuation. Harmer was a review of base income support paymentsâthe payments people rely on to survive. These are the essential payments that are required to give people a chance to have a reasonable living standard. That inquiry at that time made it very clear that those payments ought to be indexed to MTAWE or

They basically date to the same time and they make a very clear point about why you would make a difference. The fact that the government had a commitment to index DFRB and DFRDB is recognised. It was not supported by us when we were in government as it was not supported by those opposite previously when their party was in government. However, when the legislation came through just a few weeks ago we supported it.
                                                                                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                                                                                       Then in the shadow of that, the government removed that level of what they called and characterised as 'fair indexation' away from everybody else. That is some 280,000 who will lose access to that fair indexation system at a cost that I believe has been estimated at something like $65.1 billion in the 10 months of the last year of the forward estimates, which would equate to something like more than $78 million over a full year at that start. And, as we know with these things, that would grow exponentially over time if anything like the past history of MTAWE versus CPI actually occurs.
                                                                                                                                                      </p>

But to quote back to the opposition what was said about Commonwealth superannuation with respect to the review that was done by Matthews and to try and suggest that it is the same as base income support payments is ridiculous and, frankly, will not bear consideration and review within the court of public opinion.

The government really needs to get away from just saying, 'You said this,' about something which is not strictly the same, and actually justify taking so much money from so many in the veteran communityâthe very people whose payments, just a matter of weeks ago, they said ought to be treated as being special, and ought to be treated fairly.

They voted against coalition bills three times; the coalition took it to two elections and delivered it. We delivered on our promise; we implemented and indexed pensions. Labor hid behind its Matthews review; we stood up and were counted. Labor promised to do something, and then made a legacy of six years of doing nothing. We stood up for veterans. We indexed pensions appropriately; we made good on our promises, and history will show that in the court of public opinion.

Going firstly to the issue of hospital funding and the national partnerships, I refer particularly to the budget overview document that states that indexation arrangements for schools from 2018, and for hospitals from 2017-18, and removing funding guarantees for public hospitals, will achieve cumulative savings of over $80 billion by 2024-25. I want to ask whether the minister can confirm what component of that $80 billion of cumulative savings relates directly to public hospitals. Is it the $55 billion as stated by the Secretary of the Department of Health at Senate estimates on 2 June? Can the minister also confirm that no modelling was done on the effect that this reduction would have on the state's capacity to deliver services, and that states were not notified of these changes until the budget was handed down on 13 May of this year.

In fact, if you include the cuts that were in MYEFO, it is more than $1.2 billion. I ask the minister to confirm the New South Wales government's assessment, as articulated in their budget handed down today, that the Commonwealth contribution to New South Wales health spending is in fact expected to halve. I ask the minister how many hospital bed closures this will result in. Does the minister know how many hospital beds this represents, and does the minister know what effect this will have on patients in New South Wales.
                                                                                                                                                        </p>

I ask whether the minister can confirm that hospitals are already struggling to meet demand; and to confirm that the billions of dollars of cuts will affect services.

Can the minister confirm that this will inevitably mean that services will need to be cut and that the demand for services will not be met? I ask the minister to guarantee that there will be no bed closures because of these cuts. Can the minister guarantee there will not be shortages of doctors, nurses and other health workers because of the government's unilateral decision to cut $80 billion from health? Can he guarantee that progress on elective surgery waiting times and emergency departments will not be affected by these cuts?

In 2014-15 the budget papers indicate that in New South Wales the amount will be $4.579 billion, an increase year to year of 7.8 per cent. In New South Wales in 2015-16 the figure will again increase to $5.034 billion; that is an increase of 9.9 per cent. In 2016-17 the figure will again increase to $5.522 billion, an increase from 2015-16 to 2016-17 of $9.7 billion. In 2017-18 the figure again will increase to $5.947 billion, an increase of 7.7 per cent. So, as the budget papers indicate in black and white, there is an increase year on year in New South Wales and, indeed, over the period of 2014-15 to 2017-18 the total transferred from the Commonwealth to the state of New South Wales is estimated to be over $21 billion.

In 2014-15 it goes up to $3.631 billion; so that is an increase of 7.3 per cent on that year. In 2015-16 the figure climbs to $3.932 billion, an increase on that year of 8.83 per cent. The following year it goes to $4.252 billion, an increase in that year of 8.1 per cent. And in Victoria in 2017-18 the total transfer from the Commonwealth to the states in relation to public hospital funding is $4.694 billion, an increase on that year of 10.4 per cent.

That is their right to do. But at some stage the Labor Party will have to come up with an explanation about how they are going to pay the debt that they racked up over six years and yet still continue to fund public hospitals. There is a lot of rhetoric that will come from those opposite but the reality is, as I have pointed to in the budget papers, that the hospital funding provided by the Commonwealth to the states and territories, on average over the course of the next three years, goes up nine per cent, nine per cent and nine per cent, and in year 4 it goes up about 6Â½ per cent.

Julia Gillard promise that she would stop the boatsâthat she would fix up the issue in relation to the borders; Julia Gillard promised she would address the issue of climate change, which had been a real difficulty for the Labor Party; and she promised that she would seal the deal that Kevin Rudd had started to negotiate but not successfully finalised with the states. The then Prime Minister Gillard found that it was not as easy as she first thought. What happened was that this crazy monopoly money was put into the future figures. It was never, ever going to be realised by any Labor government had they won the last election. The fact is that this government was elected to clean up Labor's mess. Clean it up we will, but in doing that we provide, as we promised at the election, an increase in the amount of money that we will put into public hospitals into the portfolio overall otherwise. It is a commitment we have made and it is a commitment we will keep.

I know you have been to Curtin University and you have met with. Also Senator Alan Eggleston, senator for Western Australia, and I have had numerous meetings with people from Curtin University and also in regards to strong support from within the community to have a medical school established for teaching at Curtin University. The proposal is unique, because it deals with a lot of Indigenous health problems as well in the northern part of Western Australia. I know no decision has been made as yet, but if the school was approved it would create medical services teaching, practising in research hub particularly in Bentley, which would become a town. There is a proposal for a town of Curtin which would be housed around the university which would probably house about 40,000 people. So it would be a great allied health area at Curtin University. It would be linked with the Biosciences Research Precinct at Curtin University, the Bentley Hospital, and also potentially a new private hospital on Curtin University campus down the track at some stage in the future. This hub would thrive on medical research and that is where we come back to the question, and any national Medical Research Future Fund would be extremely welcome, particularly if there was an establishment of that type of facility in my electorate of Swan, particularly at Curtin University.

Bentley Health Services offer general health programs. They have acute medical, surgical, aged care, rehabilitation, maternity, general and specialist outpatient services, and a day therapy unit. They also have very good mental health program and an acute adult psychogeriatric unit, including a day hospital and community mental health services. The child and adolescent mental health service is an excellent area for in-patient care for adolescents and a residential program for children supported by an outreach program to the community. There is also a community health program, which includes maternal child health, school health and various community health sub-programs and centres throughout the catchment area.

The minister at that stage said, 'Yes, yes, I can guarantee that.' I also refer the minister to his own health policy document where he states that the coalition government will commit to 50 per cent of the efficient price, which he now seems to have reneged on. I particularly want to refer again to the government's intention to cut $80 billion from public hospitals and education. Page 126 of budget paper 2 states:

Can the minister confirm that no such provision exists in the government's proposed funding arrangements and that these arrangements reflect the lowest level of funding for public hospitals since Federation? Can the minister confirm whether the proposed formula for hospital funding is age-sex weighted? Can the minister confirm that health cuts are now growing at a greater rate than

If the minister does have this evidence, then I ask what action the minister is taking to ensure that individual hospitals that are responsible for this overstatement are being pursued.

                                                                                                                                                                            I also ask: can the minister confirm that the cuts in his budget across the country are the equivalent of cutting nearly 6,000 hospital beds? Given the minister wanted to quote some figures, I will quote some myself. Can the minister confirm that in New South Wales in 2014-15 the cut is $237.8 million, in 2015-16 it is $260.2 million, in 2016-17 it is $295.3 billion, and in 2017-18 it is $366.4 billion. In Victoria in 2014-15 the cut is $129.2 million, in 2015-16 it is $217.6 million, in 2016-17 it is $324.7 million, and in 2017-18 it is $289.2 million. In Queensland in 2014-15 the cut is $33.6 million, in 2015-16 it is $15 million, in 2016-17 it is $65 million, and in 2017-18 it is $235 million. I could go on in terms of each of the states and territories. Tasmania in particular overall, if you include the MYEFO cuts, loses some $49.3 million out of the Tasmanian health system. Given the minister claimed increases, perhaps he can now confirm those cuts in the forward estimates.

I want briefly to ask you a question about the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority and particularly what commitment the government can give that it is continuing, despite the fact of its changes in the budget, to progress activity based funding and the efficient price for hospital activity and to seek a guarantee in commitment, because that was a very significant and important part of health and hospitals reform in gaining efficiencies in public hospitals. But I particularly want to turn to the government's decision to introduce a

Can you explain why, if the measure is about making Medicare sustainable, not all of the money the government is raising from this revenue measure taxing sick and poor Australians is going back directly into Medicare benefits services?

Can the minister confirm that the GP tax applies to pensioners, that it applies to Australians with a disability, that it also applies to children, that it applies to people with chronic disease and that it applies to residents of aged-care facilities?

I ask the minister to confirm that these same out-of-pocket costs will apply to people who are currently bulk-billed? And does the minister agree that these costs will be prohibitive to many of the people who are bulk-billed at present? Can the minister advise whether the government has given any consideration to how many patients will avoid diagnostic imaging because they simply cannot afford it because of this government's changes?

And can the minister confirm whether medical GPs, as they have said to me, may end up having to cross-subsidise within their medical practices? They may use those patients who they do already charge a GP fee to to cross-subsidise and in fact increase the fees that they are currently charging those patients?

He has a great interest in health and his contribution earlier was reflective of that. As he pointed out, I have visited his electorate and we are very cognisant of the fact that in this portfolio we spend about $65 billion a year, and if the member for Swan had his way every dollar would be spent in his electorate! That includes the money that we spend in the sport portfolioâabout $350 million. He would lay claim to each and every one of those dollars as well!
                                                                                                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                                                                                                               Yes, we want to provide extra support to Swan, and we will do that. I recognise, in particular, the grassroots support that he provides to many of those health services within his electorate. The substantive part of his question was in relation to medical research, and I am particularly proud of the decision that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the finance minister and I took in relation to the Medical Research Future Fund. The most significant part of that Medical Research Future Fund is that the $20 billion will be capital protected so that any future Labor government cannot spent that capital down.
                                                                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                                                                               Why is that important? Because we know that over the course of the last few years when Labor spent at will and ran up debt, which is always their wont, they ran into a situation where they spent the money out of the Higher Education Investment Fund, they spent money that was to go into the Health and Hospitals Fund and they spent every dollar of capital. The idea was that we could live off that capital and that the earnings off that capital could be spent to rehabilitate and to provide extra support for infrastructure, on the one hand in relation to higher education facilities and on the other in relation to hospital and health assets around the country. But Labor spent down every dollar. So that is why it is particularly important that we protect the $20 billion, and from 2015-16 we will draw down earnings from that fund as it continues to grow. It will achieve its $20 billion by 2022-23, but from 2015-16 we will draw down about $20 million in that first year. It will ramp up to about a billion dollars at its peak, and that is significant.

                                                                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                                                                               It is significant because it will help us address many of the conditions which worry Australians as we age: diseases of the brain, which cause all of this significant concernâparticularly when you see people within your own communities and within your own families suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's and the like. By 2050, 7Â½ thousand Australians will be diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's every week. That is why it is important for us to double effectively the amount of money we are putting into medical research, not only so that we can try and strive towards those cures which the member for Swan spoke of earlier but also so that we can look at additional ways in which we can provide care. Care models are very important way of how medicine will be practised and how payment models will operate into the coming years, and those are at the centre of the government's objectives as well.

We will be successful tomorrow night, as history has shownâMr Deputy Speaker, I know you would allow great indulgence on this topic, perhaps for us to talk for an hour on the virtues of why Queensland will win tomorrow night, but we will leave that for another time.

It will be significant because we can provide support to those emerging athletes, and we will host a world-class games. The legacy assets will be particularly important to the Commonwealth, so we can provide support for future growth and increase participation right across sports on the Gold Coast, in the hinterland, in the electorate of Wright and well and truly beyond that. So I thank the member for Wright for his contribution.

I am sorry that the scare campaign continues. It is more reflective on the opposition than it is on the government.
