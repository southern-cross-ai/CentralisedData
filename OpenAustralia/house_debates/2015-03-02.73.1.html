        My question is to the Minister for Education and Training. How is the government getting on with the job of creating world-class universities in Australia and spreading the benefits of higher education to more Australians, including those in my electorate of

         I am very glad to get a question from the member on education reform because I can tell him that the government's plan is to give universities the chance to be the best higher education system in the world with some of the best universities in the world. The alternative to the government's plan on higher education is a slow decline into mediocrity, not according to me but according to the university sector itself. It has said it will lead simply to stagnation.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, the government's reforms will benefit students. They will spread opportunity to more Australians to get the benefits of higher education—

           through the largest scholarship scheme the country has ever seen, by expanding the demand of the system to sub-bachelor courses such as diplomas and associate degrees and by giving non-university higher education providers the opportunity to access the Commonwealth Grant Scheme for the first time ever, so giving at least 80,000 more students an opportunity to go to university.

           The alternative to the government's policy has been revealed by the shadow minister, Senator
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Carr" rel="nofollow">
            Kim Carr
           </a>
           , in recent speeches but also last year in October. The alternative to the government's program is to bring back 'Moscow on the Molonglo', which used to exist in this country when ministers and bureaucrats decided on how many students there were in courses and how many students there were in universities. 'Moscow on the Molonglo' was always what Kim Carr wanted. He never supported Julia Gillard's far-reaching reforms to bring in a demand driven system. Last year, on 9 October, Senator Carr said:

           Universities need to know that the cat is out of the bag on Labor's proposal for higher education. It would mean bringing back the caps, which would force low-

           students out of university. Ironically, this side of the House wants more first-generation university goers and low-SES students to go to uni. Senator Carr wants to shut off the faucet and have fewer students going to university.
