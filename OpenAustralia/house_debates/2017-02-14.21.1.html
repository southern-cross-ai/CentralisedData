        I rise to speak about my continued commitment to reporting to the House what the people of Fisher have told me that they care about in my recent 11 listening posts conducted in the last week of January.

        Laurence Brumley is concerned about whether food labelling is clear enough. I was pleased to be able to tell him about the government's new 2016 food labelling laws.

        I am determined to be a federal member who listens. I thank the constituents I have mentioned today for their honesty and helpful feedback, and I thank the over 100 Fisher constituents who came to see me during my listening posts.
