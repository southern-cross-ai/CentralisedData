        I rise to speak about a community event that I hosted in my electorate of Pearce last week, which was inspiring and incredibly uplifting due to the commitment of a man who is putting his body on the line by running 14,400 kilometres around Australia. As the sounds of the didgeridoo surrounded the members of my community who had gathered on the steps of the old Yanchep Inn inside the

        finished his day on the road. Pounding the pavement in his sneakers, he was sweating and exhausted; however, despite it being a challenging and gruelling day, he wore a huge smile for the warm welcome he received. It gave me goosebumps. You'd remember that the Prime Minister launched Pat's Run for the Voice in Hobart last month. It involves completing almost two marathons per day for six months until Pat reaches Uluru. Early the next morning, students from the Yanchep Rise Primary School ran alongside Pat on the start of his journey. We congratulate Pat for what he has achieved and continues to achieve. We were very honoured to have him in Pearce and to hear him speak so passionately about the Voice to Parliament.
