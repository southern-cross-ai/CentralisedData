        In January I was very pleased to welcome Minister for the Environment Sussan Ley to Northern Tasmania to learn about NRM North's program to protect the eastern barred bandicoot. The project is funded through the National Landcare Program, a key part of our commitment to natural resource management, with an investment of $1 billion over five years for phase 2 of the program. This project, the largest of NRM's current programs, has been funded to the tune of $1.7 million over five years and is a perfect example of local organisations and the community working together to create stronger environmental outcomes.

        NRM North has partnered with the

        and local communities to protect the landscape and create a suitable habitat for the eastern barred bandicoot, which is now extinct in the wild on mainland Australia. The preferred habitats for this bandicoot are grasslands and woodlands, with open areas for foraging and dense areas of undergrowth that provide refuge and nesting sites. Fortunately for those who are lucky enough to live in the West Tamar region, this environment is plentiful, meaning that this small nocturnal marsupial is not uncommon in the area. The project's dedication to creating the right habitat will hopefully see the eastern barred bandicoot population flourish over the coming years.

        During our visit, the minister and I visited Brady's Lookout Cider, one of our region's most popular cider makers, tucked away in the picturesque
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_Valley" rel="nofollow">

        , overlooking the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Just like their handcrafted cider, the cellar door was built with sustainability in mind and a focus on using upcycled materials. Beyond producing award-winning cider, husband and wife owners Caro and Chris have worked with NRM North, its program partners and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Tamar Sunrise to undertake plantings that are essential to the survival of the species. We were also fortunate to meet two joeys who were raised as orphans for 12 weeks by volunteer Lyndsey Sumpton and were released into the habitat during our visit. The Exeter Golf Club has also partnered with the NRM North team to provide a safe haven for the species. It backs onto bushland, with open grassy areas that allow the bandicoots to safely come out in the evening. Thanks to Mark and the team at the golf club for being part of this very important project. It's not just local businesses and organisations that can play a role in protecting this threatened species. Local residents and homes in and around the West Tamar region can also help, with NRM North working with local residents, from keeping domestic dogs and cats contained, particularly at night, to including native habitat species like tussock grass in the garden and reporting bandicoot sightings. All of these efforts are assisting to protect the species for decades to come.
