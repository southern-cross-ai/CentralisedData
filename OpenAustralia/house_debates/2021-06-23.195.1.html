        Macarthur is home to some really remarkable individuals who contribute greatly to our society. Some of these wonderful members of our community were recently recognised in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        , and I want to take the time today to congratulate these incredible Macarthur locals. First of all, I want to congratulate Mr Paul Sweeney, a recipient of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fire_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Fire Service Medal
        </a>
        for his many years of service, and Detective Inspector Glenn Brown, a recipient of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Police
        </a>
        medal. Thank you for your services in our emergency services and congratulations on your most worthy recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of local residents received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for their significant contributions to our society. Firstly, I would like to recognise the late Allan Connolly. Alan was a fixture in the local cricketing community, particularly with the Camden-Campbelltown Ghosts Cricket club. He did a fantastic job and was loved by all. He was well regarded by everyone else in our sporting community and sorely missed. The posthumous award is most worthy. Secondly, Colin Elliott,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , received his award for services to the community of Campbelltown. We all ought to be grateful for his tireless work with UnitingCare in particular and his work supporting refugees. Thirdly, Mal Frouin, OAM, is a good friend of mine. It was wonderful to see her recognised for her work in the Pacific communities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . Lastly, Catherine West, OAM, received her award for services to the medical research community. There could be no better servant of Macarthur.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to one and all, and thank you for your service.
