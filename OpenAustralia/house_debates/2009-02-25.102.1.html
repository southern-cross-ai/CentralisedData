       <p>
        I rise to welcome the news that the research laboratories within the Flinders Centre for Innovation in Cancer will be known as the Livestrong Cancer Research Centre after the foundation created by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Armstrong" rel="nofollow">
         Lance Armstrong
        </a>
        and with his support and agreement. At the age of 25, Lance Armstrong was already one of the world’s greatest cyclists. However, on 2 October 1996 Lance was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer which had spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain. His book
        <i>
         It’s Not About the Bike
        </i>
        is a very powerful testament to his personal journey. Lance Armstrong has declared himself not a cancer victim but a cancer survivor. In one of the greatest comebacks of all time, Lance won the Tour de France in 1999 and subsequently won six more—seven consecutive Tours de France.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is no exaggeration that Lance Armstrong’s surviving cancer has been an inspiration for millions, so it was particularly exciting that Lance made his second comeback in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_Down_Under" rel="nofollow">
         Tour Down Under
        </a>
        . I wish to congratulate the race director,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Turtur" rel="nofollow">
         Mike Turtur
        </a>
        , and everyone involved with inviting Lance and encouraging him to compete. This year’s Tour Down Under was a tremendous success. It injected $39 million into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        economy, more than double the amount last year. Total attendance was up 38 per cent, with 760,000 people attending, and total visitor numbers were 42½ thousand—again, more than double what they were in 2008. There is no doubt that the presence of Lance Armstrong was a huge factor in this. With my family, I was able to go to a street party in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_William_Road" rel="nofollow">
         King William Road
        </a>
        attended by 30,000 to 40,000 people and to trek over Willunga Hill so that I and my family—the children—could see Lance climbing Willunga Hill twice. With my wife I attended the Legends Dinner, which honoured Lance Armstrong,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadel_Evans" rel="nofollow">
         Cadel Evans
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
         Shane Kelly
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        So it is particularly exciting that now, in my electorate, the Flinders Centre for Innovation in Cancer will have research laboratories known as the Livestrong Cancer Research Centre. In 2007 I was able to announce that the Howard government would provide $10 million towards the construction of this centre. This is just another step along the way to seeing this dream realised for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Medical_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Medical Centre
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_University" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders University
        </a>
        and the Southern Adelaide Health Service. I would like to congratulate Professor Graeme Young, Dr Rhys Williams, Ms Deborah Heithersay and Mr Alan Young for their leadership on this project. I also thank Lance Armstrong for giving the name of his foundation, Livestrong, to the cancer research centre.
