        Let me read a poem.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let's get dressed in pink and white
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And put on our comfy shoes
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Put on our make-up, grab our specs
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And go out and spread the news
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        About this city, which we love,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And all it has to give.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What a wonderful place to visit
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And better still, to live
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We tell about the north and south,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And always include the west,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So that folk can choose to visit
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whichever they fancy best.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some people ask us why we do this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Why do we even bother?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The smiling faces when we meet says,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reward is each other.

        Estelle Wilson is a volunteer at our peak visitation and economic development body, Townsville Enterprise Ltd, and she wrote that poem. These men and women are the faces of our city for tens of thousands of visitors to our city and region. They save the city millions of dollars by volunteering their time and their experience to help anyone and everyone—from, 'Where are the toilets?' to, 'Which is the best seafood restaurant?' They are what make my city the best and brightest regional city in the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was lucky enough to be invited to a barbecue held in their honour recently. They were hosted by Townsville Enterprise
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , David Kippin, and tourism chief, Trish O'Callaghan, They know them by name like family and by their feisty reputations. I can tell you, they are all quick and lively when you leave an opening for someone to have a funny go at you. Such are the volunteers of Townsville. They give of themselves and they give generously. They give willingly not just because they can, but because they love it. They meet new friends every day and help people because they love it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past month or so, Townsville has been at the forefront not just of Volunteers Week but for the Cancer Council, the Red Shield Appeal, and other events and organisations, all day every day. I was able to be at the launch of the Red Shield Appeal along with my friend and mentor, the member for Berowra. My friend Eleni Millios and I attended the Greek Community Cancer Council Australia's Biggest Morning Tea. I have been to Rotary and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Clubs
        </a>
        and have seen what they do and work with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to make special mention of a number of groups and organisations that have always gone above and beyond the call of duty. They do this with a smile on their faces. And on behalf of this grateful city, I would like to say thank you. There is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSPCA" rel="nofollow">
         RSPCA
        </a>
        , and the Million Paws walk which was held just the other week, and the National Servicemen's Association with Warren and Lorraine Hegarty. And there is all the work the others do through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        in the Townsville region for our veteran population. The

         Museum of Tropical Queensland
        </a>
        is a professional organisation, but they could not possibly operate without their great band of volunteers. There is the Camp Quality Convoy launch which was launched by Karina and Coasty from Zinc
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM" rel="nofollow">
         FM
        </a>
        , and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YWAM" rel="nofollow">
         YWAM
        </a>
        that is used with the mission and the work they do with the medical ship in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">

        , where we raised $80,000 at a breakfast for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Filipino community and the migrant resource centre which never stop caring for others and for their people still at home, to all of you, I say thank you. To all these organisations and more, to all the volunteers at Scouts and Guides, to the people who give blood, to the ladies at the hospital, to all the drivers at North Queensland Community Transport, to the great people at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Food Bank
        </a>
        and the Pyjama Foundation, I say thank you. To the committee members of the schools' P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs, to the tuckshop workers, to those who help out at school working bees, I say thank you.
       </p>

        My son Andrew is 11 year old. He plays soccer and rugby. He swims and he boxes. He could not do it without the help of parents and friends who chip in and make these things happen. To Vincenzo MacDonald, a year 12 student at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
         Townsville Grammar School
        </a>
        , struggling with exams and life as a 17-year-old, who coaches him in the mighty North Ward Sand Crabs, I say thank you. To
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Ken Taylor
        </a>
        , not only a senior partner in a major law firm in Townsville but also the coach of the famous Saints Eagles Souths Sand Crabs from under-sixes all the way through to under-11s, I say thank you. To all the people involved in the Kokoda Spirit Swimming Club, I say thank you. To Chris Condon and Gonzo Hooper who have been so good to me and my family, I say thank you and to all the others who have helped. To all the coaches, officials, umpires, referees, touchies, and people involved in the development of our youth and their character, I say thank you. To the people involved in our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        s and our youth programs—yes, some may get paid, but they put in double what they will ever get—and they do it with a smile on their face, I say thank you.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
         If I
        </a>
        had the time to name every Townsville group who give of themselves without a thought of something in return other than a smile or a new friend, I would take up all the time this parliament has to offer. We are a great city and we are part of a great country which offers others a helping hand when they need it. To all those groups and to all those people, I say thank you very much.
