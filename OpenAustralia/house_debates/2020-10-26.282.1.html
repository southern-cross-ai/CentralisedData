        behind them, it was time for the Panthers to make it 18 wins in a row. After being 22 to nil at half-time, the young Panthers team had their work cut out for them. A determined effort saw them make an exciting comeback but just falling slightly shortâ€”just! The final score was Storm 26, Panthers 20. It wasn't the result our community was hoping for, but, in true Penrith fashion, the panthers put up a fight and fought very hard until the very end.

        Last Friday I met with people in our community down the high street of Penrith and saw many people wearing their Panthers jerseys and shops decorated with streamers and balloons in the Penrith colours: red, yellow, green and black. You could feel the excitement in the air as Panthers fans had waited 17 years for this opportunity to come around again. Although it wasn't a grand final win, I congratulate the panthers on their incredible season and on being the 2020 minor premiers. It was a hard-fought game. Although we just fell short, as halfback Nathan Cleary said, our team has the taste for next year. With so much young talent and fight on the team, I've no doubt that 2021 will be even bigger and better. Go the mighty Panthers!
