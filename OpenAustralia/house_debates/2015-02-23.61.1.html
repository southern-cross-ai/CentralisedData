        On indulgence, the thoughts of all Australians were with the people of Queensland and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        over the weekend as they grappled with the impact of two severe cyclones and remain with them as they are cleaning up and recovering from the devastation. In recent days, the Minister for Justice, who deals with emergency services, and I have been in close contact with our state and territory counterparts. I was briefed by Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles on the impact of Cyclone Lam on Darwin on Saturday. I know the Deputy Prime Minister, in Rockhampton and elsewhere, saw firsthand the impact of Cyclone Marcia yesterday.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are thankful that there was no loss of life. The fact that there was no loss of life is testament to the actions of emergency services and the precautions that were put in place. Nevertheless, this is a very trying time for everyone impacted on by the cyclones. Some people's homes have been damaged or are without power. Small business owners' businesses and properties have been impacted on. I can inform the House that there are still roads in parts of Queensland and northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        which are cut. I want to repeat the advice of emergency management authorities: if it is flooded, forget it. Please do not cross flooded roads. I can report that in Queensland the Army is assisting with the removal of debris and the restoration of critical infrastructure in the Rockhampton region.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        has activated the disaster recovery payment for the Fitzroy district of Queensland. This can be claimed through Centrelink. As well, the national disaster relief and recovery arrangements have been activated by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments for the local government areas of Livingston, Rockhampton and Banana. As members would know, this includes personal hardship and distress assistance for individuals who have been impacted on by the cyclone. Financial assistance is also available for local councils to assist with the costs of responding to Cyclone Marcia, including the costs of restoring essential public assets. Similarly, the national disaster relief and recovery arrangements have been activated in the Northern Territory for the local government areas of East Arnhem and West Arnhem. This includes personal hardship and distress assistance for impacted individuals. In Queensland it also includes financial assistance for the relevant councils.
       </p>
       <p>
        As always in these circumstances, volunteers and community organisations have been hard at work. Since the dawn of our history, our summers have been difficult and dangerous. It turns out that this summer is no exception. But, as always, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist Australians in their hour of need.

         On indulgenceâ€”no-one is more familiar with the changeable, unpredictable nature of Australian weather and the dangers it can pose than the people who call the tropical north home. But, even by their rugged standards, this was a dramatic event. When Cyclone Marcia made landfall near
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Shoalwater Bay
         </a>
         it was a category 5 storm, one of only five in more than two centuries of record keeping. Cyclone Lam also threatened homes and livelihoods as it made landfall in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         . We give thanks today that no-one lost their life in this wild weather.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have visited coastal Queensland frequently and I have visited Gove and its surrounds many times. Everywhere you go in these places you meet warm and welcoming people, Australians happy to have a chat and share a laugh. In the face of adversity and in the midst of hardship, when disaster strikes the great character of those Australians shines through. We see it in the calm and cheerful courage of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
          SES
         </a>
         , responding already to over 4,000 calls from assistance. We see it in the dauntless optimism of those returning to homes and businesses badly damaged by torrential rain, preparing to repair, rebuild and carry on. We see it in the instinctive generosity of Queenslanders and Territorians reaching out to help their neighbours, people whose first concern is the welfare of others. Once again, we are reminded that there is nothing quite as humbling as the resilience and resolve of everyday Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor wish all those affected by the cyclones a safe and speedy return to their normal lives. On that note, in government I was grateful for the cooperation of our coalition members in working to resolve insurance issues created by flood damage. Labor stand ready to assist if help is required on the vexed issue of storm damage insurance.
