       <p>
        Today I am delighted to pay tribute to three inspiring young athletes from my electorate of Higgins. Three young women—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Chaplin" rel="nofollow">
         Shelley Chaplin
        </a>
        and Cobi Crispin, both of Ashburton, and South Yarra's Katy Parrish—have been chosen to compete in the London 2012 Paralympics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now 21 years old, Katy Parrish competed in the Beijing Games when she was just 17, an experience she has described as her greatest moment. Katy was born with cerebral palsy but she has never let it hold her back. I wish her all the best in her 100-metre, 200-metre, 4x100 metre relay and long jump events. Close friends Shelley and Cobi have been nominated to represent Australia in wheelchair basketball, with the team to be officially confirmed in early July. Twenty-eight-year-old Shelley is a seasoned Paralympian who has competed in both Athens and Beijing, while 24-year-old Cobi also competed in Beijing. Both girls nominate winning the bronze medal at those games as their career highlights.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all know that to compete at an Olympic level takes a huge amount of determination that most of us simply cannot fathom, but Paralympians take it to a whole new level. Determination, commitment, strength and courage are words that come to mind when you think of the challenges these athletes have overcome to excel in their chosen fields. On my website contact page I invite Higgins residents to send messages of support that I will pass on to Shelley, Cobi and Katy for the Paralympics between 29 August and 9 September this year. I want them to know that we are behind them, wish them all the best and know that they will do Australia proud.
