        Mantle Group Hospitality employs up to 700 workers across 15 pubs, clubs, cafes and restaurants. Mantle Group though, as many of us learnt over the summer, has been avoiding paying its casual workers weekend and public holiday rates because of a zombie

        Just how many employers are there out there like Mantle Group, small or large? Just how many Work Choices zombie agreements are still in existence and being used today? Hundreds and hundreds.

People who work on a weekend or a public holiday deserve penalty rates. They shouldn't have to fight so hard to get a basic entitlement. Twenty-two years of not getting them is wrong. That is why we have acted, so no other worker has to go through this.
