       <p>
        This morning I would like to acknowledge two events in my electorate of Bass. The first is the contribution made by Northern Tasmanian local government stalwart Barry Easther
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who is one of Tasmania's longest serving councillors. The second is the recent passing of a wonderful servant of our community, Margaret Moore AM.
       </p>
       <p>
        Barry Easther served for an incredible 31 years on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tamar" rel="nofollow">
         West Tamar
        </a>
        Council in my electorate of Bass. His local government service started in 1983. In 2007, he was elected Mayor of West Tamar, and he has led the council ever since. In 2009, he was elected President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government Association
        </a>
        of Tasmania, a position he held until this month. Some may recall his national prominence in 2006 as the face of the local community during the Beaconsfield disaster. In 2009, Councillor Easther was a well-deserved recipient of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        for services to local government and the community. When he announced his retirement at the local government elections currently underway in Tasmania, there were numerous tributes to his long and distinguished service. I am pleased to say that Councillor Easther will be succeeded as President of the Local Government Association of Tasmania by the Mayor of Dorset, Barry Jarvis, also from my electorate of Bass. I wish Councillor Easther well in his well-earned retirement and Mayor Jarvis well in his new role as the head of

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would also like to pay tribute to the late Margaret Moore AM, who passed away suddenly on 19 October. Mrs Moore was born in July 1934 and was a highly respected and active volunteer for over 50 years in Launceston, working for more than 16 organisations. Just a few days before her death, as President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Wheel_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Inner Wheel Club
        </a>
        of Launceston, Mrs Moore presided over the 60th anniversary luncheon of that organisation. Mrs Moore worked for the Launceston General Hospital Central Auxiliary for 40 years and only retired as president in September. She was a member and office holder of the Esk Masonic Lodge's Ladies Committee and a foundation member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Craig_Medical_Research_Trust" rel="nofollow">
         Clifford Craig Medical Research Trust
        </a>
        as well as its Friends' Committee. Other Launceston organisations that benefited from Mrs Moore's tireless community service include the Girl Guides Local Association, Glen Dhu Primary School Mothers' Club, Kings Meadows High School Parents and Friends and Ladies Auxiliary, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Presbyterian Church
        </a>
        , the Tasmanian Caledonian Society, Fred French Home Auxiliary, the Masonic Peace Haven Auxiliary and Friends of Peace Haven. In 2002, Mrs Moore was honoured as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , AM, and she was also made a Paul Harris Fellow by Rotary. Launceston has lost a true community champion with the passing of Margaret Moore AM, and I offer my sincere condolences to her family and friends.
