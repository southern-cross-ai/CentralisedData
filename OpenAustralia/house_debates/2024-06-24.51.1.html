        I had the honour to be invited to participate in the 50th birthday of the Australian Croatian Folkoric Group, Lindo, which was held on the weekend at King Tom Club in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edensor_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Edensor Park
        </a>
        in my Fowler community. Lindo was established in 1974 with the aim of preserving and promoting Croatian folklore and traditions. It was so great to see the wonderful display of performances by Hrvatska Folkorna Skupina from Canberra and the Croation Folkloric Ensemble Vukovar. In attendance were the Croation Ambassador to Australia, Her Excellency Betty Pavelich, the current president of the Lindo, Dubravko Svilicic, as well as past presidents, including our family friend, Mile Dejanovic.

        One of the most rewarding aspects of my role as the first ever independent elected member of parliament for Fowler is that I get to see and participate in so many cultural and faith based celebrations in my community on a weekly basis. These are important cultural events that allow me the opportunity to engage and connect with my community and understand their lives, stories and lived experiences.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate the teachers, parents and young people who put on a great display of Croatian culture and folklore with their amazing performances and outfits, including four-year-olds who delivered captivating dances A huge credit to the choreographers who brought these children and their performances together. Once again, I wish Lindo continued success and thank you for inviting me.
