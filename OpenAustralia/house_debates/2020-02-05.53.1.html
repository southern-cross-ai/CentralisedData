        I'd like to recognise those residents from Menzies who were recipients of

        Melissa—or Mel, as she's known—Noonan, also from Doncaster East, was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to people with a disability. I know Mel quite well and had the honour of presenting her with the Manningham Australia Day Perpetual Trophy in 2019, which I present annually as part of my Menzies Community Australia Day Awards. Mel is an above-knee amputee with a background in national account sales and marketing. She's held board and advisory member positions for local and state governments and for disability community not-for-profit organisations. Since co-founding Limbs 4 Life, Mel has been credited with a number of awards and has been recognised for her work within the community. Limbs 4 Life empowers amputees with knowledge and support to make a real difference, because no-one should have to go through limb loss alone. It's the peak body for amputees. It supports hundreds of people across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Mel and all the other recipients from Menzies.
