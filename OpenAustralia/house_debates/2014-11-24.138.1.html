        Over the past five years, since becoming the federal member for Fowler, I have witnessed firsthand the extraordinary work and contributions of the

        New South Wales chapter. Established almost 40 years ago, this organisation has grown from very humble beginnings into one of the most significant not-for-profit organisations located in the south-west of Sydney. With offices in Bankstown and Cabramatta—in the heart of my electorate—this organisation has assisted more than 10,000 Vietnamese people and their families in the Liverpool, Fairfield, Bankstown and Canterbury local government areas. I have had the opportunity of working very closely with the president, Dr Thang Ha, and have seen the

        achieve many great things under his leadership. I also acknowledge the extraordinary contribution made by his very committed board. Under the VCA's welfare program, services such as referrals, linking people with mainstream services, providing culturally and linguistically appropriate information, access to financial advice and also problem gambling counselling are just some of the many services that the VCA provides to the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 2013-14 financial year the VCA assisted almost 2,000 people with appropriate settlement services, and another 500 individuals were helped in relation to money management education. The VCA's Links to Learning program has also had a profound impact on the lives of young people who are at risk of disengaging in mainstream education. In the last financial year the VCA supported 36 students from year 7 to year 11 with extracurricular activities such as sports, education and exam preparation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to hosting citizenship classes for non-English-speaking members of the community, the VCA's welfare centre also provided training courses to assist and prepare people for employment. The VCA's services have not only significantly transformed the lives of many disadvantaged families but also been the catalyst for their successful integration into Australian society. I commend the VCA management committee and, importantly, their volunteers, who have made a difference for the better in our community. Their contributions are the real display of the Australian spirit.
