         General Motors

       <p class="italic">

        (1) during the COVID-19 crisis, Labor has been urging the Government to act to help universities and save jobs, while:

        (a) the Prime Minister has done nothing, and now jobs are being lost; and
       </p>

        (b) it has been reported that hundreds of jobs will go at universities in Rockhampton, Geelong, and suburban Melbourne;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) without serious Government help, universities have predicted 21,000 jobs will be lost in the next six months alone, meaning:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) tens of thousands of livelihoods could be destroyed, including those of academics, tutors, administrative staff, library staff, catering staff, grounds staff, cleaners, security and many others—all with families, trying to make ends meet; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the impact on regional communities will be devastating (universities support 14,000 jobs in country Australia);
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) to save university jobs, the Government must take serious action now, and that the Treasurer could have acted to solve this problem, but hasn't—instead, the Treasurer has been deliberately moving the goal posts to ensure universities are excluded from government support;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) the Government cannot explain why a university student working a $100 shift per week receives the full $1500 JobKeeper wage subsidy, while their full-time university tutor, with three kids to support, is not eligible; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Labor believes it is a big mistake for the Prime Minister to abandon university staff during the COVID-19 crisis.

        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) charities are the most trusted sector in Australian public life; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government's failure to act on fundraising reform is costing Australian charities over $1 million every month;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australia's current framework of fundraising regulation creates unnecessary problems for charities and organisations who rely on donations from Australian supporters;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) current fundraising laws no longer meet the objectives that guided the decision to regulate donations;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) current fundraising compliance regimes do not allow charities to cultivate donor activity and make optimal use of the resources donors provide;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) meeting the requirements of Australia's seven different fundraising regimes is causing needless productivity loss for thousands of Australian charities and not-for-profits;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) Australia's current frameworks for investigation and enforcement have failed to adapt to the contemporary fundraising environment;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) current fundraising laws do not meet the donor-focused expectations and requirements that should govern fundraising regulation in the 21st century; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) the mechanisms that regulate third party fundraisers should ensure the culture of third party fundraisers matches community perceptions of their clients;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) for several years, the charity and not-for-profit sector has been calling for reform of Australia's fundraising laws;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Treasury's five year review of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, delivered on 31 May 2018, identified fundraising law as the major reporting burden on charities and recommended that fundraising law be harmonised across the country;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) in February 2019, the Senate Select Committee into Charitable Fundraising in the 21st Century called on Parliament to harmonise fundraising law within two years;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) that inquiry, chaired by Labor Senator Catryna Bilyk, delivered a unanimous report, with its recommendations being supported by Greens Senator Rachel Siewert, Liberal Senators Eric Abetz and Amanda Stoker, former Labor Senator David
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Smith
        </a>
        , and former United Australia Party Senator Brian Burston; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) postponing fundraising reform has had significant costs to the charity and not-for profit sector, with the committee estimating that the annual cost to charities and their donors is around $15 million; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) support Australian charities by ending unnecessary waste of their precious resources;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) support the generous Australian donors who donate money to our charities, by ensuring their donations are not needlessly eroded by redundant administrative and regulatory costs;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) work with state and territory governments and the not-for-profit sector to deliver a consistent national model for regulating not-for-profit and charitable fundraising activities before February 2021; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) immediately provide a public response to the recommendations made in the review panel's report,
