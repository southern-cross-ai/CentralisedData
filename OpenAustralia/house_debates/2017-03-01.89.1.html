        My question is to the Will the Minister inform the House about the current arrangements on the provision of power in our cybersecurity defences? Is he aware of any occasions where the defences have been asked to be put on generated power?

         I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and his concern. He knows that energy security is vital to national security. His electorate is central to our defence forces' capability, with patrol boats from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         Cairns actively engaged in protecting our northern borders. As a key part of our defence capability, cybersecurity also keeps us safe on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Turnbull government is the first government to put real money into cybersecurity as part of our lives. However, on 10 February this was potentially put in jeopardy, when the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         was instructed by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActewAGL" rel="nofollow">
          ActewAGL
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         environment department to assist with load shedding. As the House is aware, a key part of our cyber capabilities is provided through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASD" rel="nofollow">
          ASD
         </a>
         . The Australian Signals Directorate was placed onto diesel generators as a precaution. It had concerns with the reliability of the grid. This meant that our agency responsible for critical infrastructure was on backup power to pre-empt a cut. Having the Department of Defence being put onto generators is a rare and significant event. Defence was not the only key part of our infrastructure that was asked to move onto generators. On 10 February Canberra Airport was also requested by ActewAGL to move onto generators.
        </p>
        <p>
         A lack of energy security is a direct threat to our national security. Energy security is equally critical to our cybersecurity capabilities and to the security of Australians. We must deal with this issue. We have to have a plan to deal with this challenge. As the Minister for Environment and Energy has said, Labor has no plan. You cannot have an aspiration, target, an aim or a goal when it comes to national security.
