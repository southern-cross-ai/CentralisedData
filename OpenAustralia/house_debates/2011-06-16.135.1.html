        I wish to speak today on an issue that I have long been concerned about, and that is domestic violence. It is a truly horrific social problem, one which has an immense and continuing impact on Australian society and one which needs to be tackled. I personally find it distressing, especially when I hear stories of its occurrence in my electorate of Fowler and the surrounding areas of south-west Sydney. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police
        </a>
        report that 71 per cent of victims of domestic violence are women and 80 per cent of offenders are men, and most female victims are assaulted by their male partners. Currently, one in three women are expected to experience domestic violence at some point in their lifetime. Children can be direct victims of violence, but they are also victims as a result of witnessing domestic violence. I understand around 25 per cent of young people in Australia have witnessed domestic violence against their mother or stepmother. I want to make it clear that this is not a women's issue; this is an issue for our whole community.
       </p>
       <p>
        While many studies show that domestic violence is present in families of all different backgrounds and socioeconomic standing, there is evidence that socioeconomic disadvantage is a continuing factor and aggravates domestic violence. The issue is of particular importance to me, given the unacceptable level of domestic violence in the south-west of Sydney. The stories of domestic violence I have heard from members of my community and from social workers, health professionals and the police are all very deeply saddening.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the past three months I have had a young woman, Zara Maxwell-Smith, working in my office as part of the Australian National Internships Program. During her time with me she has compiled a report on issues of domestic violence in the south-west of Sydney. The findings of Miss Maxwell-Smith's report are firmly based on the views of experienced service providers and community leaders currently working in the area in and about my electorate of Fowler. The report draws specifically on this expertise and provides suggestions on how we can go about reducing domestic violence and its impact on our region. The report gives us information on domestic violence and the related service provision that occurs in the south-west of Sydney. It also identifies key areas that require further investigation and attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, there are concerns over the current migration procedures and their inadequacy when it comes to conveying information about domestic violence and Australian law. This finding is supported by similar findings made in a 2009 report evaluating Australia's Cultural Orientation Program. The report identifies a number of points in the migration process where further information about domestic violence should be communicated to people moving to Australia. We need to ensure that victims from non-English-speaking backgrounds have greater access to services and that the system does not continue to fail the newest members of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot stress how important it is that the findings of this report be acted upon. Awareness about the law and legal processes, as well as sufficient access to these processes, is critical. Empowering interaction with the law is crucial not only for the victims but also for the perpetrators of domestic violence. They need to understand the ramifications of such a crime, which is really a crime against our community. For many cultural groups, awareness of the law can potentially influence their attitudes so that domestic violence can become and be seen to be more unacceptable and less prevalent within our community. Considering that domestic violence has been shown to occur in intergenerational cycles, it is absolutely imperative that steps are taken to reduce the prevalence and impact of domestic violence now and in the future. I seek leave to table the report entitled

        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, domestic violence is a continuing blight on our community. It should not be seen as an issue for women. This is something that should always be seen as an issue that society itself needs to tackle. This cannot be dealt with in any other way than by ensuring that there is complete awareness, discussion and commitment to stamp out domestic violence.
