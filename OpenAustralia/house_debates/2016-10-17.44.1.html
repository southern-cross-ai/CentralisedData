        Padbury Catholic Primary School in my electorate recently celebrated its 30th anniversary. I was pleased to attend a whole school mass with students and current parents, celebrated by clergy from the Whitford parish of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady" rel="nofollow">

        of the Mission, led by Father Joseph Tran. After the service, former principals spoke of how the first lessons were conducted off site, as the school buildings had not been completed on time for the school's opening in 1986. The once sandy site has since been transformed into a campus of school buildings, some of which have been funded by federal government grants.

        In the evening, past students, staff, school community members and special guests gathered in the school hall to celebrate the special occasion with a sundowner. I had the pleasure of meeting several former students who have gone on to achieve excellence in their chosen careers. I take this opportunity to formally acknowledge in parliament the dedicated team of educators and support staff currently led by Principal Pina Hutcheson. The Padbury Catholic Primary School community is close knit and there is a strong element of pastoral care to support students as they develop their academic, sporting and social potential. I thank all of the staff for their contribution in educating and mentoring our young people.
