        Tomorrow is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Day
        </a>
        , and let's hope that Queensland Day starts tonight. Today I have the pleasure of seeing Warrigal Road State School's year 6 students here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . It was great to catch up with their hardworking teachers: Bob Bekkers, Zoe Vorkus, Judy Ofa, Maris Cock and Kerry Mansfield. They came to Parliament House after I went to their classroom to have a democracy talk as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        unit. They came into the chamber to see the historic legislation pass today—our National Plan for School Improvement.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is always great when students from across Australia come to our nation's capital and learn about our history and our democratic processes. Warrigal Road State School is one of the largest schools in my electorate, with a very multicultural school community. I have enjoyed visiting the school many times since becoming their local member in 2007. They also have one of the best fetes in my patch.

       <p>
        Warrigal Road State School recently won the Queensland primary school category in the 'Safe schools are smart schools' competition, held on 15 March as part of the third

        of Action Against Bullying and Violence. I want to use this very important opportunity to congratulate Warrigal Road State School for their positive work to create a respectful, inclusive and safe learning environment for their students.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also able to open their new multipurpose hall and classroom as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        program. I thank the P&amp;C members and all the hardworking parents for their contributions there—these great 21st century facilities. I would especially like to thank the former principal Jeff Munce, who has been appointed up and away from the school. I also want to acknowledge the new acting principal, Hugh Goodfellow, who has proven he has the qualities to lead Warrigal Road State School into the future.
