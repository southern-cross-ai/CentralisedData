       <p>
        Despite lots of talk by the Rann government about being tough on crime, crime continues to be a concern within the community of my electorate of Boothby. Youth crime, such as speeding, hoon driving, graffiti and anti-social behaviour, continues and, in some instances, is increasingâ€”in particular, the theft of copper from building sites and houses is becoming a real problem and pharmacies are being raided for drugs for the illegal manufacture of drugs. What we need is less empty rhetoric from the state Labor government and more practical action.
       </p>
       <p>
        The state government is responsible for policing and court sentencing, and more needs to be done. The Australian government is doing all it can to invest in crime prevention. The Australian government recognises that the most effective way to fight crime is at the grassroots level. The National Community Crime Prevention Program was launched in May 2004.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that my electorate and neighbouring areas have now received three projects under the Community Crime Prevention Program. One million dollars has been given to Southern Junction Community Services for two projects which will operate in the Marion and Onkaparinga councils, which include the electorates of Boothby and Kingston. The projects will reduce crime and improve community safety through coordinated intra-agency intervention and will also reduce the incidence and impact of violence and fear in families living in the southern suburbs. There has also been an announcement of $90,000 for a closed-circuit
