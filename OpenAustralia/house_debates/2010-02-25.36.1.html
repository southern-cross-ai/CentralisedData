         Last week I was pleased to be able to visit Ballan to be able to have a look at how the Ballan superclinic is going from strength to strength. I can tell the parliament that more than 17,600 people have presented at the Ballan superclinic since it opened late last year. Such is the demand for, as an example, optical services, which have not been provided in the community before, that they are now being offered weekly instead of monthly. Last month, as a number of people in this House would be aware, I officially opened Queensland’s first superclinic at Strathpine. This $2½ million superclinic has been delivered two months ahead of schedule. Members of the Strathpine community are now enjoying increased access to primary healthcare services, Medicare-eligible services are being bulk-billed and multidisciplinary care, on offer at the clinic, is available seven days a week.

           . He might be interested to raise his objections to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
            GP
           </a>
           superclinic with two of his constituents, Lisa and Olivia Graham, who gave the superclinic the thumbs up in the
           <i>
            Northern Times
           </i>
           , one of the local papers. After having called five medical centres, the only place that was open and willing to treat Olivia, after she injured herself on Sunday, was the Strathpine superclinic. Mrs Graham says that, without the superclinic:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … we would have sat for hours in emergency …
          </p>
          <p>
           In the same article, superclinic director, Dr Evan Jones said that each weekend the clinic is:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … treating 120-130 patients who otherwise are likely to have turned up at emergency wards.
          </p>
          <p>
           This passes the common-sense test in the community—that, when 60 per cent of Australians are finding it hard to access a GP after hours, these sorts of services can provide more support.

             Those opposite are asking for updates about other superclinics, which I am more than happy to provide to them. Across the country, 29 contracts have been signed. I have mentioned the state-of-the-art superclinic in Ballan in the member for Ballarat’s seat. I have mentioned the thumbs up that the mum gave to the Strathpine superclinic and I can also talk to you, for example, about the services that are being provided at seven other sites, including Palmerston in the member for Solomon’s seat. The superclinic there is still on track. Actually, when I was there a couple of weeks ago—

              Those opposite might like to call out, but the member for Solomon, the local mayor and I inspected the enormous superclinic there which is growing daily and is obviously good for community members there. Perhaps people might be interested in the interim services that are being provided in the member for Riverina’s electorate. Services are already being provided there. Other sites include

              . Construction and infrastructure is underway at 12 sites. I know that the member for Leichhardt was very pleased when the superclinic site there was chosen and work has commenced on that. I know that the member for Eden-Monaro was delighted—not only has a green light been given for the local superclinic but, this Monday, he was there when demolition was started to make way for the construction of the superclinic. I know that the member for Corio and the member for Corangamite are delighted that superclinic work has started—this is a report from October last year—and that their construction is going very well.

              I would also like to report to the House that university involvement in the superclinics has been astounding. There are 28 sites which have universities as part of their construction—

                It is very interesting, amongst the cat-calling, that the member for Parkes and the member for Wannon are being particularly quiet. They are two members who lobbied hard for their electorates to be added to the superclinics program. Although it may take time, they are very delighted that their electorates are getting these services. The point I was about to make was that the members for Corio and Corangamite are no doubt very pleased that

                  has recently announced that, for the first time, they have appointed a chair of general practice who will be placed at the Geelong clinic.
