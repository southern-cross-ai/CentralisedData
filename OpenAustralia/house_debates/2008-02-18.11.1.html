        Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to take the opportunity on behalf of the government and the parliament to recognise the event which occurred today in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Hall
        </a>
        . This was the official welcoming to the parliament of the cross and icon which are the symbols of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Youth_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Youth Day
        </a>
        . The Leader of the Opposition and I attended in the company of Cardinal Pell, the Archbishop of Canberra and Bishop Anthony Fisher, together with Catholic schoolchildren from across Canberra and the wider region.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an important occasion to symbolise on behalf of both sides of Australian politics the extent to which we and this parliament support this important celebration of the Catholic faith later this year in Sydney. World Youth Day will be a major event, bringing to Australia tens of thousands—probably hundreds of thousands—of pilgrims from around the world. It will also be accompanied by a visit to Australia, the first, by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict" rel="nofollow">
         Pope Benedict
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Father" rel="nofollow">
         Holy Father
        </a>
        . Both the Leader of the Opposition and I have already indicated publicly how much a welcome guest the Holy Father will be when he visits Australia and how important an event World Youth Day will be not just for the Catholic faith in this country but for the wider Christian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I conclude by saying that those measures commendably promised in support of World Youth Day by the previous government of Australia have been embraced by us as the next government of Australia to make sure that this event is as successful as possible and important for the community of faith in Australia.
       </p>

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I join the Prime Minister in strongly endorsing his remarks about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Youth_Day" rel="nofollow">
          World Youth Day
         </a>
         and the visit of the cross and icon here to Australia. This is an extraordinarily important event for all Australians, whether Catholics or Christians, because it is a celebration of faith and of the fragile yet powerful belief in hope. It is also a recommitment by all of us to young people, not only young Australians but all those young people throughout the world who are very much our future.
        </p>
        <p>
         Obviously I join with the Prime Minister on behalf of this side of the House in celebrating this major event and providing and committing all of the support that we can to His Eminence Cardinal George Pell and those Catholics who will come from all parts of the world.
