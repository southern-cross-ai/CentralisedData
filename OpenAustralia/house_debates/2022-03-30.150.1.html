       <p>
        Australians have been confronted with many challenges over the last three years. We've been faced with devastation and heartbreak including natural disasters like the recent flooding in my electorate of Bonner. We have been navigating the turmoil and unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have faced threats from foreign countries attempting to interfere in our domestic affairs and testing the capabilities of our military. Despite all this, our economic recovery is leading the world, and, more than ever, Australians are being provided opportunities and supports to invest in their futures and families.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no other place where this is more true than in my electorate of Bonner, and, in my opinion, there is no better place in the world to build a life and start a family than Bonner. I've been a local resident for over four decades. I attended school, started a small business and am now raising my own family here. I want Bonner to be a place where everyone can come to raise a family, start a business and invest in their future also.
       </p>
       <p>
        To do this, I am working hard to deliver my plan to ensure local residents have access to the resources and opportunities they need to pursue their dreams and thrive. I am committed to continuing to fix local roads and reduce traffic congestion. I've already delivered over $200 million for local road projects and infrastructure upgrades, including at Newnham and Wecker roads, Rochedale roundabout and Lindum crossing. I will continue to fight for more funding to fix local black spots and ensure residents can get home sooner and safer to their loved ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've been a fierce advocate to protect our way of life and our local environment, working alongside community groups like Ocean Crusaders, Bulimba Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee and Mackenzie Bushcare. I'm also passionate about expanding our sporting facilities to make them easily accessible for local families and I have provided federal funding for sporting groups like the Bayside United Football Club, the Mt Gravatt Vultures and the Carindale district junior Aussie rules club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our economic plan is working, and we are delivering lower taxes and record jobs, and I'm seeing these benefits firsthand in Bonner. New trainee and apprenticeship commencements are up by over 90 per cent. Over 1,700 families are saving $2,000 a year on child care, and over 68,000 taxpayers in Bonner will benefit from our tax relief measures. This means the hardworking people of Bonner can keep more of their own money in their own pockets. We've also seen record investment in health and education, providing higher-quality care and greater learning opportunities to Bonner families.
       </p>
       <p>
        As someone who is passionate about mental health, I will continue to fight for more services and funding across Bonner. There have already been so many positive developments from my mental health plan. I've had great community consultation and roundtable discussions with mental health experts and have partnered with groups like Roses in the Ocean to trial pop-up safe spaces on the Bayside.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also working with groups to ensure that we are reducing emissions and increasing renewable energy. Over 25,000 rooftop solar panels have been installed in Bonner, and it's exciting to see new green energy technology developments from local businesses like Tritium and Wildfire in Murarrie.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the incredible spirit of the people of Bonner and our wider Brisbane community. The recent flooding event was heartbreaking for so many families, and after seeing firsthand the devastation caused by these floods I can say that I'm humbled by how resilient the people of Bonner are. Alongside my team, Brisbane City Councillor Lisa Atwood and countless Bonner residents, I spent days delivering sandbags, food, water and generators to flood affected residents. The people of Bonner do not hide during a crisis, and as the rain came down and the water rose I was out there with my community, gumboots and all, making sure local families were safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonner is a great place to live, raise a family and build a life. I am committed to delivering for the residents of Bonner and continuing to work with the community to protect our lifestyle and help locals get ahead.
