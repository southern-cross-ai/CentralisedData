       <p>
        On Friday, 30 July, I had the pleasure of visiting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badger_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Badger Creek
        </a>
        Primary School in my electorate of Casey to present an Australian flag, to present some certificates and to participate in the Friday afternoon school assembly. I pay tribute to the principal, Garry Embry, vice principal Julie Kugler, the music teacher, Jenny Legg, and the school council president, Michael Emmett.
       </p>
       <p>
        Badger Creek Primary School is a school of roughly 150 students. It is like many country schools of its size in so many respects, but it stands out in one area—that is, the school's commitment to music.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school decided to make music a feature of their learning program and, largely through the funding of parents and the fundraising association, it conducts a very impressive music program and school band that I had the pleasure of hearing play at the assembly. I want to pay tribute to all of the leaders at the school—teachers and parents. It was great to be able to see firsthand their commitment and the difference they are making to the education of students at Badger Creek.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier in the month I also had the pleasure of attending the opening of the renovated offices of Healesville Interchurch Community Care Inc., otherwise known as HICCI. It is made up of seven local churches and provides vital services in the form of emergency relief, including a food bank and Christmas hampers, volunteer community transport and community meals. The programs and the services are run by over 100 volunteers who are involved in driving, packing food, cooking and serving meals as well as working in reception at the offices in the main street of Healesville. They are also supported by local businesses and social clubs who make generous donations to the organisation. I want to pay tribute to President Margaret Blair, and to Executive Officer Kerri Goding who does so much not just with Healesville Interchurch Community Care Inc. but with so many organisations in the Healesville community.
