        I am sure that all members of this House are very much looking forward to the release, shortly, by the Auditor-General of his inquiry into round 6 of the Mobile Black Spot Program. Everyone will welcome the thorough investigation by the Auditor-General, because of course this was a shameful and sordid misuse of public funds. You'll recall, of course, that, under this fund, the Minister for Communications hand-picked the locations to receive funding. And guess what? It's a remarkable coincidence, but 100 per cent of the locations that the Minister for Communications chose in

        were in electorates held by the

        ! Isn't it remarkable? It is just an extraordinary coincidence! The funny thing is, oddly, precisely the same thing happened in Victoria: 100 per cent of the allocations were in Labor seats. That's why the Auditor-General's been very thoroughly and very forensically going through all of the information here, and we look forward to seeing his report. I hope the minster has provided him with documents, because, of course, the minister put formal submissions to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         Information Commissioner
        </a>
        about why she should not provide any documents in response to freedom of information requests on this topic. That tells you everything you need to know. It's a shameful misuse of public funds. We very much look forward to seeing that Auditor-General report very soon.
