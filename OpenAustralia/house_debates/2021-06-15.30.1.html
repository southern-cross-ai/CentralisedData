        In the great game of rugby league it's not often that you see the scoreboard hit 110, but that rare feat has been achieved by the Mascot Junior Rugby League Football Club, which celebrated its 110th anniversary at a dinner on Sunday night. The Mascot Jets, the oldest continuing junior league club in

        , was formed in 1910. That of course makes them 111 years old, but they had to postpone the celebrations due to COVID. And there has been plenty to celebrate over the years: the 'two blues' took out their first club premiership in 1921 and have kept up that winning record, claiming 43 of the last 50 club championships in the

        . At the dinner on Sunday night they announced the 'golden years' team from 1970 to 2020. In total, 145 Mascot junior players have gone on to play first grade and 15 of those have gone on to represent Australia at the highest levels. I would like to give a special shout-out to the club president, Frank Cookson, who has been involved with rugby league for 55 years, and to Bill Kennedy
