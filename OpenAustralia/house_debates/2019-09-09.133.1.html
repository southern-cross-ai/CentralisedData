        There are 15 outstanding surf lifesaving clubs across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . Today I want to pay tribute to one in particular: Umina Surf Life Saving Club, which was recently named
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        club of the year at the Surf Life Saving Awards of Excellence New South Wales. Umina surf club received three prestigious awards in total on the night, including New South Wales patrol of the year and youth lifesaver of the year. These awards recognise the tireless efforts of the club's executive and the work of all members over the past season. Umina is one of the largest surf lifesaving clubs on the Central Coast. It reached the impressive milestone of 1,000 members last season and continues to grow. During the last surf season, over 300,000 visitors to the beach were kept safe by the club's dedicated volunteer lifesavers, who patrolled for a combined total of 10,200 hours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Umina is a fantastic example of a club that has created a wonderful community—a place where members from the broader community can 'find their fit'—and this was recognised as part of the club of the year award. The club ran a unique marketing campaign—'Does the cap fit?'—encouraging members of the broader community to consider how they could contribute to the surf club, be it through patrolling, competing or simply putting a hand up to help.
       </p>
       <p>
        The work that Umina surf club has done in connecting with the local community and local sponsors also contributed to their winning that award. I'd like to congratulate President Stephen Scahill and his executive: Director of Lifesaving Paul Sharpe, Director of Education Bob Powell, Director of Administration Jenni Darwin, Director of Facilities Greg Smith, Director of Surf Sports Harold Marshall, Director of Finance Wendy Cook and Junior Activity Coordinator Skye Marshall. I congratulate you on this outstanding achievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Umina's patrol No. 12 were also recognised as New South Wales Patrol of the Year. They received this award for their determination in keeping beachgoers safe, as well as their outstanding beach management. Congratulations to Patrol Captain Skye Marshall and all the members of patrol 12.
       </p>
       <p>
        Seventeen-year-old Kai Darwin from Umina received the New South Wales Youth Lifesaver of the Year award for his incredible contribution to the club. In three years he's patrolled over 270 hours, as well as volunteering 1,500 hours towards surf lifesaving activities at a state and national level.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of our clubs on the Central Coast make a great contribution, and two more members of our lifesaving community were recognised: Peter Lemmon from Terrigal Surf Life Saving Club, my own surf club, who received the New South Wales Masters of the Year award, and Paul Duignan from Copacabana Surf Life Saving Club, who was awarded Facilitator of the Year. Congratulations to both.
       </p>
       <p>
        Summer and the next surf season are just around the corner, and our amazing volunteer lifesavers will be out patrolling, giving up their time this year to keep our beaches safe. As a member of the lifesaving community, I know that none of our volunteers do what they do for recognition or praise, but I do place on record my thanks to the thousands of Central Coast locals who will help to keep our community safe this summer.
