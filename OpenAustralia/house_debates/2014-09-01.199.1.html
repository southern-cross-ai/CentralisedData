       <p>
        After what can only be described as a horror budget, which has dominated the talk in my electorate for months, it is nice to speak today about some positives, about some wins in my local community. Victoria's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_the_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Father of the Year
        </a>
        has been named as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Wyndham Vale
        </a>
        resident Adam Strathairn, recognising his commitment to being involved in his children's lives and including them in his. I congratulate his children, who nominated him for Victorian Father of the Year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Wyndhamvale Football Club's senior women's team yesterday won the grand final by five points against Whitehorse under the captaincy of Jess Heath and Andrea Cameron and the guidance of senior coach, Kerry Saunders. Well done the Falcons. I would just like to say that I have been to watch the girls play in a few games this season and they are playing some fantastic football and now have been rewarded for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like the member previously, I would like to congratulate students Young Ye and Ifrah Rehan who were announced as recipients of the Australian student prize for 2013. This award, obviously, speaks to their talent and commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to mention the Wyndham Community and Education Centre, which has won the excellence in creating local solutions in the learn local awards for 2014. Jenny Barrera and her team do great work across education and community strengthening services at the centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        No doubt there were other sporting winners across the week and I look forward to hearing of more winners from Lalor. The achievements speak to the resilience, commitment and talent of the people of my community.
