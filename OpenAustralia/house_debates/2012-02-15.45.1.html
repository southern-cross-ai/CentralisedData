       <p>
        I rise with sadness to inform the House of the passing of Elizabeth Mary Graham, known to all as Betsy, a former mayoress of Ryde council and legend of our local Liberal Party. Betsy was a registered general nurse and qualified in intensive care. She was a gifted clinical nurse, who demonstrated an absolute commitment to her profession and the development of those around her. More recently, Betsy undertook a Doctor of Nursing and I understand she is to be awarded this certificate posthumously. She certainly knew all the questions to ask her doctor as she battled cancer in the last few years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Betsy was fiercely proud of her Scottish heritage and her allegiance to the Monroe clan. She was passionate about music and led the choir at her local church each week. As an example of her passion, she even left them instructions for next Sunday's service! Betsy was an active grassroots political campaigner, often seen pushing her stroller full of leaflets around Eastwood, promoting Liberal candidates and values. She was a graceful lady who calmly and strongly accepted the difficulties of her last few years. Betsy Graham leaves behind Peter, her devoted husband and the former president of my Bennelong conference, their children Kate, John and Lizzie, and a party room full of grandchildren. Betsy, you may have passed; however, you will live in our memories with only good feelings.
