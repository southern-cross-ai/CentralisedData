       <p>
        On indulgence, I seek to update the House on the incident that has taken place, we understand, off the southern coast of Java.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Protection_Command" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        received information from our post in Jakarta that at approximately 11.30 Australian eastern daylight saving time yesterday, 9 December, 30 people had been rescued from a sunken vessel at Cibalong, Garut, in Indonesian waters approximately 45 nautical miles west of Cilacap,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Java" rel="nofollow">
         West Java
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I am advised that no request was, had been or has been made for Australian assistance, either by the passengers on board the vessel or by Indonesian authorities involved in coordinating and undertaking the rescue. Australian government officials in Jakarta are seeking additional information. There have been media reports of three deceased persons; however, this has not been confirmed through our post. Our post has advised of two deaths and several persons being in a critical condition, and we are seeking further updates.
       </p>
       <p>
        This further loss of life is as tragic as the losses of life that preceded it in similar circumstances, and we extend our sympathies to the families and friends of those affected. It is especially tragic as these deaths were needless and avoidable. This latest incident highlights once again the fatal consequences of people smuggling, particularly at this most dangerous time of year.
       </p>
       <p>
        People should not believe the people smugglers' lies. Of course Australia will meet our obligations on safety of life at sea, but this does not mean there is a safety net for your voyage. You should assume the worstâ€”as was sadly the case for those who lost their lives yesterday. These lives are no less precious than our own, and that is why the government, through Operation Sovereign Borders, will continue to deploy all means at our disposal to determine, disrupt and prevent wherever possible people's getting on the boats. I thank the House for its indulgence.
