       <p>
        Last Saturday, 30 August, I had the honour and the privilege of opening the redeveloped Jones Park. The redevelopment was achieved through a $3.5 million federal government grant and that was out of a total of $3.95 million for the total project. The funding enabled the construction of new fields, lighting, spectators' stands, a new clubhouse, a new building for training administration, plus a whole lot of work done under the ground that you do not see that makes these parks work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would particularly like to pay tribute to a number of people who helped make this redevelopment happen. First of all, the Jones family. They are the descendants of Jack and

        who generously gifted the land, a former dairy farm and piggery, at a peppercorn rate when they could have got a lot of money for it, but they had a vision for junior sports. Jack Seary, who is considered the father of junior rugby league in Cairns, was a driving force behind the establishment of this back in the 1960s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members of both the Seary and Jones families were there and certainly appreciated what we were able to achieve.

        , the Chairman of Jones Park Board of Management, and Chris Van Dorssen, the President of the Cairns and District Rugby League Club, were also there. There was a great attendance from a whole raft of sporting identities from Cairns. I am certainly going to continue to work with Warren Pitt and Chris Van Dorssen, together with other levels of government, on continues funding for the project. We certainly need a grandstand. That is the next thingâ€”
