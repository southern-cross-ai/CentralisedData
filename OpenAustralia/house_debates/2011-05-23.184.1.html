        I stand here today as a proud and passionate supporter of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        Suns. Next Saturday, 28 May 2011, the Australian Football League's newest team will play its first game at the purpose built stadium at Carrara on the Gold Coast, and I along with thousands of others will be there to cheer them on. It is just three years since the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        formally invited representatives from the Gold Coast community and businesses to form a board with a view to demonstrating that a Gold Coast based AFL team had a good prospect of long-term success. In March 2009 it was officially announced that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Suns" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast Suns
        </a>
        had been granted a provisional licence to compete in 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the Gold Coast Suns made their debut and already have had two winsâ€”firstly, against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         Port Adelaide
        </a>
        , historically on Port Adelaide's home ground and, secondly, defeating the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Lions" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Lions
        </a>
        at the Gabba. For a team that was not expected to have great success in their first year, to win two games so early in the season gives us an indication of their potential. The success of the Gold Coast Suns is due not only to its players but also to its coach,

        , Bob East, Paul Scurrah and Janelle Manders and of course the growing base of members and supporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gold Coast Suns will not only have a major impact on football and sport in general on the Gold Coast; they will also be a major contributor to the Gold Coast economy. It is estimated that having an AFL team based on the Gold Coast will boost tourist numbers by over 120,000 annually and result in more than $30 million being injected into the local economy. This will be a very much-needed tonic for our tourism industry, including our accommodation providers, tourist operators, restaurants, cafes, taxi and limousine operators, as well as local retail outlets.
       </p>
       <p>
        We hope that when AFL fans come to the Gold Coast to watch the games they will witness firsthand what we have to offer and return for a longer stay, perhaps with friends and family. We hope that when the corporate AFL sponsors and fans see what the Gold Coast has to offer they will consider the Gold Coast as a venue for business and corporate events. Having our own AFL team is a wonderful opportunity for the Gold Coast and we plan to maximise the benefits to our community and to promote them and the Gold Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        We should all be proud of the Suns and what they offer to our great city. They are a young team, full of promise and potential. They are relentless and they are determined. To paraphrase part of their song: they will fight till they hold up the cup; they are the mighty Gold Coast Suns. I, along with my fellow Gold Coasters, wish them every success.
