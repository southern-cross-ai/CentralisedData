        I recently had the pleasure to spend an evening with local volunteers at the 2013 Ballarat Volunteer Recognition Awards, which were organised by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Way" rel="nofollow">
         United Way
        </a>
        and Volunteering Ballarat. It was a terrific event, and I want to recognise all of the volunteers who were nominated and those who were award recipients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Volunteers are one of the best things about our community. Their service, dedication, compassion and care for their neighbours is what helps to make local communities great. There is a certain irony, however, in acknowledging the service of volunteers with an award ceremony—after all, volunteers do what they do for the sake of people around them and they do not do it for financial reward or for recognition; they do it for the sake of their local community. But when you consider some of the statistics of volunteerism in Australia, it is absolutely necessary that we celebrate their contribution and that we say thanks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirty-six cent of the adult population in Australia are volunteer, and that is more than six million people. The volunteering sector contributes more than 730 million hours of unpaid work each year in Australia, and that is valued at around $16 billion. Whether they are providing support to families who find themselves in crisis or defending communities during floods or fires, whether they are helping our new migrants to settle in the community or recognising the work of men and women who have served their nation in wartime and peace, whether they are creating a community garden, assisting children with learning difficulties or simply serving in the local op shop, volunteers give their time, their energy and their hard work to serve a purpose beyond recognition.
       </p>

        I also want to particularly take this opportunity to reflect on the efforts of one very special volunteer in Daylesford, who sadly passed away earlier this month. Roz Moynihan was the epitome of a volunteer—someone known by an entire community for her decades of tireless commitment to the welfare of others. I first encountered Roz and her husband Danny when they ran the Daylesford Post Office. Despite having incredibly busy working lives, they were actively involved in the community, particularly in providing training opportunities for young people. For almost 20 years at any event for any organisation in Daylesford was made brighter thanks to Roz's involvement. If you attended or were part of the speedway, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        , the ChillOut Festival, the art show, the urban fire brigade, the ladies auxiliary,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        or Rotary, you would find Roz there lending a hand, rattling a tin or just making you feel welcome with her wonderful smile and her laughter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roz is remembered by her husband, Danny, her children, Justin and Natalie, and their extended family members. In fact, it was the biggest funeral we have ever seen in the Daylesford community, with almost 1,000 people lining the streets to farewell Roz. We will certainly miss her. She was someone I certainly counted as a friend. She always warmly welcomed me and my family into the community. Roz, we will sadly miss you, but it was a life well and truly lived to the full.
