        I have a question of you, Mr Speaker. It's in regard to the deaths that were announced today by the Prime Minister, which are quite shocking and tragic. Many of us have memories.

        , as some of you with grey hair might know, was a particular favourite in this House not because of his expertise as a minister, especially in regional and rural areas and rural affairsâ€”and chooks! He was also a favourite of the House. That's not to diminish former minister West. The question I would ask of you is: because the date of the next sitting will also be the budget sitting of this House, will members be kept informed as to what will be the arrangements or the protocols? And we have one day tomorrow; could there be some brief indulgence tomorrow? I am putting the question to you, Mr Speaker, but it might be for the Leader of the House to answer.

          And as a former agriculture minister, I know exactly what the member for Monash is saying about the warmth with which
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerin" rel="nofollow">
           John Kerin
          </a>
          was held. We have a really strong principle of letting families be the guide of when we make the speeches. They might not end up choosing budget day, but there have been occasions where we've actually waited some weeks before the speeches happen. The undertaking that I can certainly give, though, is that, on whatever day it occurs, I will certainly move a resolution referring the speeches that are being made to the Federation Chamber so that there is a proper opportunity for the many members who want to speak on the condolences to do so. Notwithstanding how much we would like to say something straight away, I really don't want to depart from the principle that we have kept in letting the families make that decision.

           I appreciate the member for Monash's sentiment and will advise the House accordingly out of respect for the wishes of not only the House but the families as well.
