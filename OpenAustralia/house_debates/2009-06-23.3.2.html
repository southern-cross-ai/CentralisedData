           As the Leader of the Opposition stands and asks any question in this place, I would ask the entire nation to reflect on what credibility can be attached to this Leader of the Opposition, a Leader of the Opposition who has refused to answer with any basic element of credibility. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the only responsible thing for him to do in this parliament today is to resign.

             The parliamentary secretary and the member for Fadden will get an opportunity to have a discussion outside the chamber. I indicate to the chamber that, even though it is only three or four minutes past the hour, there appears to be an opportunity for me to give an early general warning—which I have not given yet, but I will have it under consideration. Both sides of the chamber, if they really think that these issues are important, will sit in silence.

              It is interesting that in this first question time today, following the extraordinary events of yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition would immediately seek to try and change tack. The Leader of the Opposition’s entire attack against the credibility of this government has rested on a forged and faked email, a fraudulent document. Therefore, in a desperate attempt, the Leader of the Opposition has sought today to broaden the agenda, to broaden the attack, out to anything else other than the matters for which he has yet to account fully to this House. The matters on which he has failed to fully account to this House are: firstly, what were his and the opposition’s full dealings in relation to this faked and forged email; secondly, what were the opposition’s full dealings—

                    Once again, the Leader of the Opposition fails to answer these most basic questions: what were his full dealings on the matter of this email and what were his full dealings with the public servant in question? Rather than engage again in the politics of smear, let us have some real evidence here. As I said on the day in question—

                     Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister is defying the chair. You asked him to be relevant. He is refusing your—

                       Therefore, in response to the matters which have been canvassed in this House, both today and on other days, I would say that the Leader of the Opposition actually needs to not engage in the continued politics of negative smear but to actually ask substantive questions.

                        They howl and protest as they seek to take the spotlight off themselves. As I said on the day in question, the representations I can recall in relation to that matter were from a car dealer in the electorate of Bennelong—I remember turning around and pointing to the honourable member for Bennelong. That was the one I can recall; they are the representations that were made by me in that respect. That is consistent with the remarks I made on that day.
