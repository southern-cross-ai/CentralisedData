       <p>
        I rise to mourn the passing and honour the memory of the foundation president and life member of the Elouera

        . John earned his surf-lifesaving bronze medallion at Bondi in the mid-1930s and honed his rescue skills on that iconic beach. He moved to the Sutherland shire in the 1950s with his new bride and built his house 200 metres, through the sandhills, from the surf. John surfed daily and carried out a number of solo surf rescues, plucking swimmers from the strong current.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a number of years he continually petitioned the council to set up a further surf club in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bate_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Bate Bay
        </a>
        area. In 1965 that vision was finally realised with the creation of the Police Citizens Boys Surf Life Saving Club at Elouera. John served as president for four tough years, leading the young club in its formative years. Under his guidance, its fortune and members grew. Elouera Surf Life Saving Club started out as a humble tent on a stretch of sand back in 1966. Now it is a thriving club and a vital part of our local community, providing a safe beach for thousands to enjoy and bringing people together from all walks of life and ages, from early infancy to 75 years old and beyond ohn passed away in Sydney on 30 July, just prior to their annual general meeting. He was 90. He is remembered by all of his friends, his family, including his son Anthony, and our entire community. His legacy will be remembered down on

        for a very long time to come. Today we have the opportunity in this place to pay homage to a great Australian and a great resident and citizen of the shire.
