       <p>
        The Turnbull government's decision that Navantia is the preferred bidder for two naval supply vessels is another cruel blow to Australia's ship workers and steelworkers. The government's lame excuse that Australia does not have the capability to build the vessels is insulting and unconvincing. This is a $2 billion contract that could support up to 3,000 jobs, but it seems they are all going overseas, when Australian ship workers and steelworkers are desperately looking for work. The Turnbull government's recent release of a defence white paper and a vague announcement about a defence precinct in Adelaide will do nothing to secure the jobs of

        shipbuilders who are facing retrenchment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a government that talks about innovation and asks the private sector to be bold but fails to lead by example when it has the opportunity to invest in research, innovation, training and Australian job creation. The Turnbull government is now presiding over the demise of Australian shipbuilding, just as it presided over the demise of Australian car making. The government is well into its third year in office and has had three defence ministers. No amount of spin or blaming the last Labor government will excuse the Turnbull government's incompetence, dithering and broken election promises regarding the submarine contract and other naval vessels.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is time the Turnbull government showed some faith in the capabilities of Australian industry and the Australian workforce and invested Australian dollars in building a future for Australians.
