       <p>
        About a fortnight ago I drew the parliament’s attention to the severity of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        ’s public housing crisis, the state’s deepening housing affordability crisis and the increasing demand for public and emergency accommodation. Despite this dire situation for many families, I would like to take this opportunity to convey to this chamber a good news story. I mention the case of Mr Aaron Jolly. Mr Aaron Jolly approached my office in relation to obtaining urgent accommodation for him and his two-year-old daughter Taleea. They were living in a car that was parked in their friend’s driveway. Mr Jolly initially contacted the local state Labor member’s office but found them rather unhelpful and not empathetic to the situation—which I find surprising, as I have a good deal of respect for the local member. It may have been an office administrative issue. But Mr Jolly was persistent, so they advised him they would organise an appointment for him to see the Department of Housing and Works in Armidale. When he attended the alleged appointment he was informed by the manager that no appointment had been made for him. That was when Mr Jolly contacted my office.

        As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the federal government has little to do with the control of state public housing in any state of Australia; however, we are in cooperative arrangements with the states for funding of public housing. Firstly, I contacted the local branch of Homeswest to ask that Mr Jolly’s application be expedited due to the urgency of this situation, with the coldness of winter coming on. In between times, working with the office of

        , the East Metropolitan member, my staff tried to obtain assistance for emergency housing from places such as Wanslea and Crisis Care, but at each attempt we were unsuccessful. A letter was sent forward to Dr Ruth Shean’s office from the Department of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Development" rel="nofollow">

        to address the gravity of Mr Jolly’s situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, with winter approaching, it was imperative that a secure and stable environment be provided for Mr Jolly and his two-year-old daughter. As a single father, Mr Jolly also went to the local
        <i>

        </i>
        newspaper to try to get it recognised that his situation was so extreme. I am pleased to advise the House that Mr Jolly was provided with priority housing and was given the keys to his new home on Wednesday, 6 June 2007, after his appeal was successful. He now has a stable environment and a roof over his head for his young daughter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Jolly came to my office just recently to express his personal thanks to me and my staff for our assistance. He advised me that it was nice to approach somebody active in the local area who cared about the wellbeing of constituents. I am very pleased to say that in this case we were able to help a desperate constituent in need.
