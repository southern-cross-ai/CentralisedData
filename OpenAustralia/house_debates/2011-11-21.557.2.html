        Today I rise to say a special thank you to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Union_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Credit Union Australia
        </a>
        for the first year of its Adidas School Fun Run Community Care program, through which CUA donates money to local schools and supports worthy community initiatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, I had the privilege of visiting Hamilton State School for CUA's $5,000 donation to contribute to a new multipurpose play area. The school aims to add to the health and enjoyment of students, and this grant will help them to do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools across Queensland had to apply through a grant submission process. After 75,000 votes were cast Hamilton received the most votes from members of the community for their proposal and were among nine schools across Queensland who won a grant. The principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Brandt" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and everyone at Hamilton worked very hard on their submission. The degree of support from school and community for this project was outstanding. It was fantastic to see such a small school—90 students—win this coveted award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hamilton State School participated in the school fun run, through which they raised $1,300 from members of the school community to help promote healthy living amongst their students. The slogan for the CUA program is 'Your School, Your Community, Your Benefit', and that certainly seemed to sum up the approach at Hamilton State School.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank Olympic bronze medallist,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cate_Campbell" rel="nofollow">

        , who was also there on the day. She gave a very inspiring speech about the hard work and dedication required to achieve their dreams.
