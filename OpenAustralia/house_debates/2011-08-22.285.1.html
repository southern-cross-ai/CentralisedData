       Dear Mr Murphy

       Australia Post â€” petition to request a street posting box in Falcon, Western Australia
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 12 May 2011 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee's consideration regarding a request for a street posting box at the Miami Village Shopping Centre in Falcon, Western Australia.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As a Government Business Enterprise, Australia Post does not receive any funding from taxpayers and, as far as practicable, it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has noted that its policy concerning the provision of street posting boxes takes into account the general increased mobility of the population, constant demographic changes, shifts in posting habits and Australia Post's Community Service Obligation commitment to offer reasonable postal network access to its customers.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The policy provides that in capital city metropolitan areas and provincial cities, a street posting box facility will be provided at or near all postal outlets. In addition, street posting boxes will be provided so that residents have access to a lodgement point within two kilometres. In providing posting facilities, Australia Post gives preference to sites where adequate postings can be anticipated.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has advised that there are three street posting boxes within a reasonable distance of the Miami Village Shopping Centre:
      </p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post acknowledges the points outlined in the petition presented by the local community but, based on the existing level of demand in the area, it considers that the reasonable posting needs of the local community are being met by the current spread of posting facilities and that the provision of an additional posting box cannot be justified at this time. Australia Post will continue to monitor postage services in the Falcon area to ensure that additional services are provided as the need arises.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       However, Australia Post has also advised that residents are able to hand small quantities of their fully prepaid outgoing mail to the local postal delivery officer for posting.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I trust this information will be of assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy
