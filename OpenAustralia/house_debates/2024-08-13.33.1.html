       <p>
        On Sunday, a group of people boarded the grand 100-year-old vessel, the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Stephens" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        mayor, Leah Anderson. There were elderly people, children and a pregnant woman aboard. They were subjected to what has been described to me as a frightening and dangerous situation. A large recreational fishing boat emblazoned with signs reading, 'No offshore turbines Port Stephens', allegedly purposely harassed the vessel. Those onboard said that the waves created were up to a metre high, and if the skipper had not taken such quick action, it would have been even nastier than it already was. It went on for 15 minutes and left people really distressed and quite shaken.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those involved have defended the action by saying they needed to rock the boat—what big men they are!—because they've been ignored. Well, they haven't been ignored. It is completely untrue as some of the people involved have not only met with me on numerous occasions in my office but have been here, to parliament, to meet with the minister himself about this very issue. They are spreading disinformation and have taken it to the next level with intimidatory tactics. It is not on. It is one thing to peacefully protest and advocate for sensible outcomes, but it's another thing to harass people. I would say to the opposition, who have aided and abetted them in some of these behaviours, to be careful. Just stop it. You were for offshore wind, and now you've turncoated.
