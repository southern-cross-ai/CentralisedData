        Following the dismissal of the former Prime Minister Abbott by the Liberal party room earlier this week, there has been much conjecture about ministerial responsibilities, reshuffles, demotions and promotions, and the nation has been left in a state of limbo when it comes to a range of vital portfolio areas that help drive and shape our economy, our communication technology, our employment needs and our vision for the future. But what has gained little attention in the last few days is a portfolio area that has sadly been lacking any real focus or commitment for the last two years since this Liberal government was elected, and that is the portfolio of women. When
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott

        became Prime Minister, he abolished the position of Minister for Women and transferred responsibility instead to the office of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Many argue the minutiae of title changes and portfolio responsibilities, but few could argue the importance of having a senior minister in the cabinet with adequate resources dedicated to women, when Australia is facing an epidemic of violence against women.

        Prominent journalist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Wilkinson" rel="nofollow">
         Lisa Wilkinson
        </a>
        wrote a letter to the then Prime Minister last week outlining the situation eloquently. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … when it comes to acts of violence against women, this country is in crisis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With 62 women now dead this year alone, and countless others either maimed, emotionally scarred, or living in fear on a daily basis, something is broken in this country, and it urgently needs to be fixed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I agree with Lisa, and so does the Labor Party. With 62 women killed this year alone and one in three women affected by this violence, we need concerted action and change, and we need it now.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the Leader of the Opposition for his very prompt action in writing to the new Prime Minister offering bipartisanship to help eliminate violence against women. Labor has already made a range of commitments to this end, and we would welcome genuine engagement with the new Prime Minister to coordinate a national response to family violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        State governments in Queensland and Victoria are already moving forward with purpose and urgency, and should be acknowledged for their strong advocacy. But we need intervention at a federal level too if we are to adequately address this crisis across the nation. The new Prime Minister has had a lot to say about eliminating violence against women and now it is time for his words to be matched by action. I strongly urge Prime Minister Turnbull to make the elimination of violence against women a priority for our nation and the government he now leads.
       </p>
       <p>
        In June this year, I stood in this place and named the 43 Australian women who had lost their life in acts of violence this year. That number, as I mentioned earlier, has tragically climbed to 62 women just three months later—another 19 lives unjustly lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, I wish to acknowledge these women who have joined the long list of indescribable tragedy. I acknowledge: Rebecca Webb, aged 36; Norma Ludlam, aged 75;

       <p>
        We know that for young women under the age of 45 the most likely cause of death or injury is domestic violence. This is a scourge. It is an epidemic in our society. This senseless killing must stop and it must stop now. These women must not die in vain. Please, if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault or domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT or 1800737732 for help.
