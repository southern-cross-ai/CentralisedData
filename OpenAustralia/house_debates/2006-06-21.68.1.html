        My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. Would the minister outline to the House the importance of the handover to the

         I thank the member for Casey for his interest in defence and defence industries. It is timely, as many of the nation’s defence industry representatives are here in Canberra today for the 14th annual Defence + Industry Conference. As the Minister for Defence has outlined, the government has a defence capability plan, but a key support of that is the capability of our defence industries.

         Last Friday was a special occasion. The last frigate built by Tenix at its iconic Williamstown shipyard was delivered on time, on budget as part of a 17-year fixed-price contract worth over $7 billion. It is important to recognise the quality of that work and it shows the capability within our defence industries. The ships are of outstanding quality. In fact, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of Navy
         </a>
         said it is the finest ship he has ever taken receipt of. It is a credit to Tenix, its workforce, the expertise of its subcontractors, the dedication of the Anzac system project office and the collaboration between the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">

         and the

         I sense there is an interest for metrics and numbers in the House, so I will provide a few. This project has benefited two economies—that is,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          Australia and New Zealand
         </a>
         . On both sides of the Tasman there have been 1,300 companies involved, with 73 per cent of local content, producing about 8,000 jobs. I am sure the House would be interested to know that the
         <i>

         is 3,600 tonnes of ship with a top speed of more than 27 knots and a range of about 6,000 nautical miles. It is very highly equipped and it has already proven itself to be of considerable value to the nation, with an effective contribution in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf" rel="nofollow">

         and off the north coast of Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of those in the House would be aware that the ship was tested in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         as part of the Navy’s contribution to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War" rel="nofollow">
          Gulf War
         </a>
         . It was off the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Faw_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
          Al Faw Peninsula
         </a>
         , and the Anzac was identified as the ideal ship to support the commando assault on that peninsula. The passage to the fire support area was shallow, most likely mined, yet the Anzac made it through safely. It was the first of several ships called upon to fire, with the target being a major Iraqi military installation. For the first time since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
          Vietnam War
         </a>
         , our Navy provided combat gun support. Those 45 rounds of five-inch shells, otherwise known as bricks, were precisely delivered and it is thought to be one of the most effective operations of its kind for accuracy and support in naval history. I commend the project to the House, congratulate Tenix and its workforce and recognise that the Anzac ships continue to evolve and have their capability increased. To the

         and all those who sail on her, we wish you fair seas and a following wind.
