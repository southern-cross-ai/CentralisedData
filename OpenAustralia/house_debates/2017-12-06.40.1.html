       <p>
        Last night, I was reminded about why I'm in politics. Last night, after years of advocacy, the Australian endometriosis community—the warriors, the sisters, the researchers, the medicos, their friends and their families—made a number of significant steps towards ending the silence on endometriosis. And I'd like to think that the member for Boothby and I played a small part in those steps and those advances. Last night, we officially launched the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness in front of more than 60 sufferers, their friends, their families and the community, including the Minister for Health and the shadow minister for health.

        Last night, the endo community officially launched their peak peak association, the Australian Coalition for Endometriosis, and last night that coalition did something extraordinary. After being in existence for just four months, it presented a mutually-agreed set of priorities for action: that endo become the 10th national health priority area; that funding be provided for a national public awareness campaign; that a menstrual education program be rolled out in state and territory schools; and that endometriosis become a target for new clinical care standards. And the coalition for endo got action: a commitment from the minister to develop a national action plan for endo with the coalition; a targeted call for endo research; and to partner with Jean Hailes For Women's Health to make endo the focus of next year's Women's Health Week. Last night showed that by working together we can end the silence on endo. Let's get on with it.
