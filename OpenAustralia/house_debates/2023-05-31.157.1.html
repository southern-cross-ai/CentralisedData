       <p>
        During my time as a local member, I have seen extraordinary contributions from volunteers right across my electorate on many occasions. Volunteers' dedication, selflessness and commitment to community is absolutely commendable. Of course, they never get the attribution for the hard work they do, thanks for the hard work they do or gratitude for the hard work they do, but which they deserve. They deserve much in the way of thanks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Volunteer Grants program, which was an initiative of the former coalition government, recognises the valuable work of Australia's volunteers. It is a wonderful opportunity to acknowledge and appreciate the immense impact that volunteers have in our suburbs, our towns and our regional communities, and they have had that impact in recent years during particularly challenging times.
       </p>
       <p>
        The grants are of between $1,000 and $5,000 and can be used by groups for anything that helps with costs that are incurred by their volunteers, such as first-aid training, background security checking or transport for volunteers who may have a disability. A community group can also purchase much-needed equipment like an iPad, or they can keep pace with technology. In Hume, under this round of the program, we had 23 successful projects share funding of just over $66,000. The Camden Tigers Football Club will be using their grant of $3,840 to go towards the purchase of a portable

        system for the club. The Crookwell Services Club will receive $2,000 to purchase garden equipment to assist volunteers to maintain the grounds around the club and with the magnificent work they do in that club to support their local community.

        in Goulburn will purchase equipment to assist in first aid training of volunteers. They provide that first aid support for so many different sports and events around our community. The Penrose Community Association will purchase a commercial dishwasher for their new hall. This area was badly impacted by the 2019-20 bushfires, and it's great to see that community association so strong again after such a tough time.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just a few of the incredible groups in my electorate that will benefit from the program. This also highlights the extraordinary range of community organisations that rely on the support of volunteers to continue their good work in our communities. In this era of big government, we forget the role that these local community groups play and how important it is that they get the appropriate support—

        I'm talking about local community and local community organisations here, and those opposite should perhaps respect those community organisations. From sports clubs to community centres, these groups have a vital role in fostering social connection, providing essential services and enhancing the quality of life for all of us who live in the regions.
