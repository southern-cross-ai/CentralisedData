        to provide voters who are blind or have low vision with the means to cast an independent and secret vote. These amendments are needed as the current legislation requires a voter who is blind or has low vision to rely on another person to complete their ballot paper. The resulting vote is neither secret nor independent. The amendments will modify the existing parts of the electoral act and referendum act, which provided for a one-off electronic voting trial at the 2007 federal election. The amendments maintain the existing approach of these parts so that electronically assisted voting will be made possible by broad legislative frameworks supported by regulations. This approach provides flexibility to change the arrangements as technology develops from election to election.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments provide for regulations to be made to cover matters such as the process of casting an electronically assisted vote, the privacy, secrecy and integrity of the vote and the places, days and hours on which the electronically assisted voting will be available. The amendments retain the requirement for a record to be kept of who has voted using the electronically assisted voting method. The amendments also require a record to be kept of the vote. This record will be included in the count like a ballot paper.

        Following consultation with peak representative bodies, for the next federal election the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
         AEC
        </a>
        proposes to utilise a call centre arrangement so that a person who is blind or has low vision may cast a secret vote. A voter may attend any of the AEC divisional offices in the two weeks before polling day and have their eligibility to cast a vote checked against a certified list or some other means. If eligibility is confirmed, the voter will be connected to a call centre where two trained operators will complete a ballot paper in accordance with the voter’s instructions. The completed ballot papers will then be forwarded to the relevant division and counted in the usual way. This is a measure that was welcomed yesterday by Australia’s Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Graeme Innes, as one that has the potential to benefit 300,000 Australians who are blind or have low vision. The arrangements proposed for the next federal election are intended to be the first phase in delivering more options to voters who are blind or have low vision.
