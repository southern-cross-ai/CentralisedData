        Over the last two days I was very pleased to have with me in my office Kira Kelly, who is part of the Learn Earn Legend Program, an internship for young Indigenous students to come and see the goings on of departments and also parliament. Kira asked me to read something on her behalf about her local area, because I really wanted her to think of herself as a representative for her suburb. This is what Kira had to say about her local area:
       </p>

        I’m pleased to write this speech about my local community and how it could be improved. I live in a suburb called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Alexander Heights
        </a>
        . In this area the people are friendly and approachable. Alexander Heights has lots of parks and ovals for sporting activities. I love to play sport and guitar and when ever I have free time I usually spend it outside playing netball or singing and playing guitar for my sisters. I moved to Perth two years ago from the small town of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Hedland" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . When I first moved to Perth I was excited but sad to leave home. Since then I have had to learn to catch public transport everywhere and when you come from a small town it can get confusing. But since then I have learned to catch buses and trains everyday. I am very happy to live in this area but I believe it still can be improved.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I go to school at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aranmore_Catholic_College" rel="nofollow">
         Aranmore Catholic College
        </a>
        in Leederville in Perth. It is a very small private school with many students who are willing to learn. Because the school is in Leederville I have to catch the bus every morning and afternoon. But when I walk to my bus stop everyday I see bus stops and walls that have been vandalised. As I get on to the bus I notice that the vandalism only gets worse. Every bus I get on has names of people and gangs that are scratched into the windows. Sometimes the graffiti is so bad that makes it hard to see through the window. Vandalism is not just found in my area, but it is found all across Perth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I think that the kids that get caught vandalising should be punished but also educated about the cost of cleaning and fixing the vandalised property. Kids who have been caught vandalising should also be put in a program that helps them work on art to get on the right track in life and maybe even paint murals for the city walls.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is what Kira Kelly had to say about her local area. It was a pleasure to have her accompany me and to reflect on things in her local area. She said that being here was a great initiative, she had a great experience and it has actually opened up ideas for her. She did say to me that she will now consider perhaps working in

        , Childcare and Youth on the Learn Earn Legend program and also say that perhaps in Kira Kelly we may have a future member of cabinet.
