       <p>
        Last Friday I had the honour of attending the official opening of the Sunnyfield Charmhaven community hub, which was recently renovated and expanded. Sunnyfield Disability Services have operated on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        for over 14 years and provide programs designed to enrich the lives of people with an intellectual disability. Based at Woongarrah, the Sunnyfield community hub provides a user-friendly environment where clients and carers can receive the support they need to achieve their goals, dreams and aspirations. I had the pleasure of meeting clients including Josh, Tyson and Vivian, who was celebrating her birthday, as well as the remarkable carers, families and staff members who make an everyday difference to those with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sunnyfield Disability Services provide a variety of programs to approximately 160 people on the Central Coast, including transition-to-work, school-leavers and community-based programs. The community hub offers a variety of development activities including fitness, music therapy, gardening, woodwork and cooking. With a growing demand in Dobell for services that address the increasing need for child, ageing and disability programs, it is heartening and inspiring to meet the people involved with Sunnyfield, who are dedicated to making a difference. An organisation such as Sunnyfield Disability Services, which makes such an impact to the lives of people who need it most, is the sign of a selfless and noble cause that deserves as much support as possible. I am privileged to provide support as the federal member for Dobell.
