        On 15 May in my electorate of Hasluck I assisted the Cancer Council to raise money for cancer research by hosting one of Australia’s Biggest Morning Teas. I also took this opportunity to pay tribute to the many volunteers and to the volunteer spirit of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        community celebrating Volunteers Week. I invited a group of committed community-minded people to celebrate both events. A room full of volunteers is a great place to be. The enthusiasm, camaraderie and positive attitudes of those present ensured the day was well celebrated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians have a deep sense of helping others. It is one of the determining characteristics of our Aussie nature. We are a great volunteer people. The number of volunteers in this country continues to rise. In 2004, there were some 6.3 million Australians donating their time and energy to others. Personally, I expect that the figure is much higher as most people provide volunteer support without realising it—whether it is driving the elderly, reading with primary school students, supporting the school through P&amp;C activities or assisting volunteer organisations to provide valuable services to others such as guiding and scouting. These are vital organisations that have made a significant contribution over many years, providing the basis of a strong and healthy community. And let us not forget the many thousands of mums and dads who give up their weekends to coach our junior and senior sporting teams.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met people from all over the electorate whose commonality is their compassion to assist in the growth and wellbeing of others. Amongst those was Marilyn Hall, a fantastic lady who has given 18 years of service to the Kalamunda Scouts Association. She is the Kalamunda scout leader and has scouts enrolled in all levels of scouting, from Joeys to Venturers. Her group is the largest and most successful in the district, having won the district award for the past five years straight. When Marilyn is not at the scout hall, she is busy volunteering her cooking skills at the scout training venue.

        also received recognition for almost 20 years of dedicated service to the People Who Care Agency. People Who Care initially started with eight people in a small house in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         East Perth
        </a>
        . They have since grown and moved into new premises in Guildford. They provide vital services to aged and disabled people who choose to live independently. Their valuable assistance enables those people to get on with living their lives where they choose rather than being placed in nursing homes. Bill and Judy both joined as volunteers with People Who Care by taking people to their doctor and hospital appointments and shopping.
       </p>
       <p>
        As with all volunteering, once you become involved there is a natural progression to continue to do more and more. Judy has now progressed to the op shop, which is part of the premises in Guildford, where she has become an important member of the op shop committee. I had the privilege earlier this year of officially opening the newly relocated op shop. It was a fantastic morning celebrating the opening of the shop, which had been moved to a more prominent position to enable passing trade. I cannot speak highly enough of this organisation. They continue to come up with new and innovative ways in which to encourage volunteers into their service. Our ageing population will require more and more people to step forward and play vital roles within the community.

        Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea was all the more successful thanks to many other people from my Hasluck community. My colleague Senator Judith Adams was my special guest on the day and I wish to thank her for her assistance and her candid speech regarding her personal battle with cancer. She also helped to reinforce the enormous impact that volunteers have within the community.

        of the Meals on Wheels organisation in Kalamunda organised volunteers to assist on the morning with endless cups of tea, which was very much appreciated. Geraldine Smailes, a Kalamunda resident, and

        of Crabbs IGA kindly provided 200 pink cupcakes, which went down well with the cups of tea. Community spirit in Hasluck is thriving and I am very pleased that this is the case because communities where people care for each other are always stronger, healthier and happier places to live.
