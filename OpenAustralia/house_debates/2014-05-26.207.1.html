       <p>
        by leaveâ€”On Monday, last week, I attended the funeral of Lynne Duffy. Lynne was a very active worker within our community. She was a mother, a grandmother and a great-grandmother and a person who constantly contributed to and supported our community. She was a member of the Labor Party and on many occasions she helped me in my campaigning and to be elected to this place. Each and every one of us has that special person that we work with. Lynne was one of those wonderful people.

Lynne was a wonderful person who worked so very hard for so many people in so many different ways. I know that not only will her family, her friends and her colleagues within the
