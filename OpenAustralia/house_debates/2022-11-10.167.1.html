       <p>
        Today I'm glad to bring the voices of young people in my electorate into this place. As part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Voice
        </a>
        in Parliament campaign, young people across Australia were invited to prepare a short speech on their vision for our future, to be delivered by their member of parliament. I want to commend Ashleigh Streeter-Jones of Raise our Voice on her powerful work in this campaign and note that, as a result of her advocacy, more than 80 of my colleagues in this House and the other place are speaking on behalf of young people from their parts of Australia.
       </p>

       <p>
        Sitting suspended from 09 : 57 to 10 : 12
       </p>
       <p>
        My office received a number of excellent speeches from writers between the ages of 13 and 21 on topics including health care, disability access and the environment. I can tell you it was a very difficult choice to make, but the speech I've chosen to deliver in this place was written by 16-year-old Amelia Turk, who lives in Fremantle and is in Year 11 at

        , which I attended a long time ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amelia already has a resume that's probably longer than mine. She's spoken in the WA parliament, served as a youth board member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">

        Millennium Kids and attended as a delegate the International Cooperation Forum in Geneva and the Stockholm+50 international meeting.

       <p>
        These are the words and vision of Amelia Turk:

        It's 2072 and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP" rel="nofollow">
         COP
        </a>
        77 is being held in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The world is in awe, trying to comprehend the feat that Australia has achieved.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It started with a change of heart, then a set of strict and ambitious targets, and then the change to achieve those targets. Australia is now a leading nation, a nation admired for taking action when it was called for.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Amelia Turk, I am 16, I live in Fremantle, WA, and this is my dream.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My dream is about the future but it is also about today, and the time in between.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you do not act today, my dream is unlikely to become reality.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's environment is steadily deteriorating, the State of the Environment Report 2021 confirmed this. It confirmed that we need to take action now. We cannot wait any longer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If Australia does not act now, it will be too late.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you, the current leaders of Australia, do not act now you will leave this 'dire' environment to us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you do not act now, the future leaders of 2072 will have to deal with the consequences of today's choices, carrying the burden of inaction from half a century earlier.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I ask you what you would prefer, for my dream to become a reality or the 'dire' outcome to be cemented into our planet and for the consequences to be on show for all the future generations?
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a very, very fair question that Amelia Turk poses. It's a challenge for all of us in this place, and I thank Amelia. I thank all those right around Australia who have participated in the Youth Voices in Parliament initiative and contributed some fine words and some well-conceived visions of how Australia could be in more positive circumstances if we listen to the young people of Australia and do our jobs here.
