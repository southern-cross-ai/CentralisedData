         I do thank the member for Tangney for his question. The member for Tangney is right: we went to the election with a clear plan to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. From day 1 we have been cleaning up Labor's mess and we have been keeping our commitments. On day one we saved the car industry from Labor's $1.8 billion fringe benefits tax hit. On day one we saved the tradies of Australia from Labor's tax hit on their self-education expenses. From week one we have had Operation Sovereign Borders in place and that has reduced illegal arrivals by boat by almost 90 per cent. Every day we have been tackling Labor's debt and deficit, stretching out as far as the eye can see, through many measures, including the Commission of Audit.

           This government has been implementing the plan that the people of Australia voted for. That is what we have been doing and yet there is one group of people who are very unhappy with the way the people of Australia voted and that is the team opposite, led by the leader of the Opposition. The people voted to scrap the carbon tax.
          </p>
          <p>
           Government members: Hear! Hear!
          </p>
          <p>
           What we have seen is members opposite voting against a $550 Christmas present for the families and the households of Australia. The people voted to repeal the mining tax, and members opposite are voting in favour of this tax on jobs and investment. Above all else, the people of Australia voted to restore temporary protection visas. That is what the people of Australia voted for, and members opposite have voted with the people smugglers. That is what they have done: they have voted to give the people smugglers' business model another go. Members opposite damaged our national interest in government and now they are seeking to perpetuate the damage from opposition. It does not matter what the Australian people voted for; members oppositeare voting against it. It does not matter what the Leader of the Opposition says; when he votes he always votes for higher taxes and more illegal boats.
