         The Peninsula
        </a>
        region in my electorate of Robertson is a diverse area which over the last 100 years has grown from a service centre and holiday hotspot into a thriving hub of more than 30,000 homes and businesses. It takes in

        , Blackwall, Patonga and nearby suburbs. It is a very beautiful part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        that is known by many around Australia. Sadly, the Peninsula has been neglected by many governments—not least the former Labor government, which failed to meet the very real need for more jobs and better infrastructure in this very important part of my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I want to launch the first Peninsula Growth Statement to update families and businesses in a very important geographical area on the Central Coast about what this federal government has been doing. We have delivered on the commitment we made to Peninsula residents that we made in the coalition's positive growth plan for the Central Coast before the last election, and we are continuing to help build an even stronger region through further investments and community engagement.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is quite timely because we are about to see the completion of one of the most significant civic redevelopments in the Peninsula in recent years—Woy Woy Oval. This fulfils a very important commitment of $3.5 million from the Turnbull government to help realise the dream of sporting clubs, businesses and the local community to turn this run-down sports ground into the second largest stadium in my electorate on the Central Coast. Featuring a 600-seat grandstand, new club facilities and a kiosk, this will be a venue where sporting folklore will be written for decades to come, starting this season. The President of the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, Matthew Wales, said this project has already created several hundred jobs and could act as a continuing catalyst for growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        From Woy Woy Oval, if you head just a little way down Ocean Beach Road to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umina_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Umina Beach
        </a>
        and then turn right at McEvoy Avenue, you will find, at the foot of a mountain, McEvoy Oval. This is a stunning wide-open space used by a range of local community and sporting groups. But, sadly, its focal point at the moment is a run-down toilet block. So it is no wonder we have seen a tremendous response to a recent announcement of a grant of $304,000 to knock down and help upgrade the facility. It will mean improved storage, a canteen and a club room in a vibrant and functional community hub in Umina Beach.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with these infrastructure investments, we have also delivered on our $200,000 commitment for more
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        cameras at Woy Woy, Umina and Ettalong Beach. The evidence is there, backed up by local businesses and police, that CCTV is a strong force against crime and antisocial behaviour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another issue that has evidence stacked up wherever you are on the Peninsula is the state of local roads. Our records show that in just the past two years more than 600 people from the Peninsula alone have directly contacted me about their concerns regarding local roads. Importantly, we are targeting the most dangerous intersections on these roads with $500,000 committed to building new roundabouts in Umina Beach and Woy Woy as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_Program" rel="nofollow">
         Black Spot Program
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        While local roads are primarily the role of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford City Council
        </a>
        , the council has received almost $2 million in 2015-16 as part of the federal government's Roads to Recovery program and has also invested funds from the Financial Assistance Grants. This includes $245,000 towards upgrades to parts of Lone Pine Avenue in Umina Beach and Springwood Avenue in Ettalong Beach over the last year. This has built new kerb and gutters, drainage, road surfaces, bus shelters and footpaths. We have also committed $675,000 to help upgrade the intersection of Woy Woy Road and Langford Drive and work has already started on the M1-M2 missing link, NorthConnex. Both of these projects are crucial for people on the Peninsula.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want to see more opportunities for Peninsula residents to live and work locally, and to do this we need better technology. That is why I am pleased to be able to report on the fast rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . In coming weeks, more than 30,000 more homes and businesses on the Peninsula will be declared ready for service and be able to switch on to superfast broadband. This is set to be one of the largest activations done by the NBN and it will benefit families and businesses in more than 20 suburbs, including the entire Peninsula region.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many more funding commitments that we are delivering to the Peninsula, and I look forward to updating the House in due course.
