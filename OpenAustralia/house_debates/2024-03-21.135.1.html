        At the recent Queensland local government elections, Noosa mayor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Stewart" rel="nofollow">
         Clare Stewart
        </a>
        stepped down from her role after an exemplary term in office. Noosa is a prospering, vibrant, resilient and dynamic place, and no community can become what Noosa has become without strong, passionate dedication and leadership. Clare is the embodiment of these qualities. Her huge contribution to the Noosa community reflects this, from the coast to the hinterland and in all the Noosa villages in between.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clare and I have successfully worked together to advance Noosa, securing more than $25 million in Australian government funding to make Noosa's roads and bridges safer, strengthen Noosa's communities, support local groups to prevent bushfires, assist in disaster recovery, sustain Noosa's environment and grow the economy. The expansion of the Peregian Beach Digital Hub, the new Peregian Beach Community House and the Olive Donaldson sports pavilion are just some of the projects we've worked on together to achieve. Clare was also instrumental in securing the Cooroy Hinterland Playground, the Noosa Parade upgrade and the Beckmans Road upgrade. She also leaves a powerful legacy on social issues, having raised record funding for the prevention and awareness of domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        While Clare has been a fantastic mayor, no community is immune from the consequences of an incompetent and failed state Labor government. We need change in Queensland, and that begins with the election of a Crisafulli
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        government. The LNP listens to and understands Noosa. It was the LNP which understood the uniqueness of Noosa and restored its individual voice after Labor silenced it through forced council amalgamations. Now, after so many years of Labor, their cost-of-living crisis and rising energy prices are hurting householders and businesses. Crime rates have soared, and the youth justice system needs an overhaul. And we need to improve access to health and housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clare is serious about tackling these issues, and, if you want real action in Queensland—and in Noosa—it's blatantly clear we need to change the state government, and that starts by electing representatives like Clare Stewart, who has put herself forward as the candidate in Noosa for the state election, who will be a key player in an LNP team and sit at the table where the decisions are made. It's crucial that an LNP government is elected in Queensland, and we need Clare Stewart there alongside David Crisafulli and the LNP team to ensure Noosa gets its fair share.
