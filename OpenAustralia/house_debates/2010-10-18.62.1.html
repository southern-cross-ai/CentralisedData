        My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_Women" rel="nofollow">
         Status of Women
        </a>
        , representing the Minister for Sport. Will the minister update the House on the efforts of our Australian athletes at the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games?

         I thank the member for Bass for his question. It is my great pleasure, on behalf of the Australian government but particularly on behalf of the Minister for Sport, Senator Arbib, to commend the organisers, to commend Perry Crosswhite and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Commonwealth_Games_Association" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Commonwealth Games Association
         </a>
         and particularly to commend the Australian Commonwealth Games team on what were some tremendous endeavours in India recently. Whilst there were some bumpy roads in anticipation in the lead-up to the games, what we actually saw in Delhi were some truly remarkable feats by Australians. We saw that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Delhi Commonwealth Games
         </a>
         provided a stage for true superstars like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Meares" rel="nofollow">

         and Matt Cowdrey or superstars like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Pearson" rel="nofollow">
          Sally Pearson
         </a>
         to show that they are truly gifted not just in athletic abilities but also in attitude. Whilst sports stars have enjoyed many of these events and many of the gamesâ€™ results, I think that all Australians can appreciate that our team has now arrived home safely and securely. I think it is appropriate that we pay tribute to the organisers and to those who worked so hard to make sure that there were not any security incidents at this event; that this did run smoothly; and that all of the Australian team is now home, is now looking to get back into training and is now looking to represent Australia proudly in London in 2012.
