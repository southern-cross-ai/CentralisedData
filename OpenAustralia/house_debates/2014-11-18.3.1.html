        <p>
         Madam Speaker,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , it is long overdue for an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Indian Prime Minister
         </a>
         to address this parliament, given that the leaders of the United States, China, Indonesia, Britain, Canada, Japan and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         have already done so. But I am personally delighted that this omission is at last corrected. It is fitting that, in the home of our democracy, we should be addressed by the leader of the world's largest democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is so much that we can learn from a Prime Minister who must try to reach some 830 million voters and whose mastery of electioneering has meant that in India's recent election he was literally beamed into dozens of different rallies simultaneously all around the country. Prime Minister Modi is the first in decades with an absolute majority in the lower house, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha" rel="nofollow">
          Lok Sabha
         </a>
         , because he imbued his fellow citizens with the sure hope that tomorrow can be better than today. He gave credit for India's success to those who really deserved it. He told voters that their country belonged to them, not to their rulers or to their officials. Even here in Australia, the Modi campaign and victory inspired hope, because Australians too believe in work, family and community, in doing things for love, not just for money, and in living our ideals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our two nations have much in common. We share an ocean. We share a language. We share a heritage as Westminster democracies enjoying freedom under the law. We even share the same national day, 26 January. Above all, we share a history. Way back in 1795, the very first cargo ever to be shipped out of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         was mahogany and cedar bound for India. In the Gallipoli campaign that forged our nation, 5,000 Indians fought by our side, and Prime Minister Modi made a splendid presentation to me at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          War Memorial
         </a>
         this morning in their memory. The Australian Army and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Indian Army
         </a>
         were brothers in arms at the siege of Tobruk. As part of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">
          British Empire
         </a>
         forces, our soldiers shared the tragedy of Singapore and the triumph at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Alamein" rel="nofollow">
          El Alamein
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Australians admired the way India won independence—not by rejecting the values learned from Britain but by appealing to them, not by fighting the colonisers but by working on their conscience. Through all the troubles of partition and all the subsequent dashed hopes, India has magnificently maintained its democracy. Although India's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         per person is still only about half of China's, its growth is strong, its economic prospects are bright and its population is likely to overtake China's in the next couple of decades. This is why people now speak of the Indo-Pacific as the focus of the world's economic dynamism. With China, India is the emerging superpower of Asia, the emerging superpower that is already a democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gandhi taught that the most powerful force is not weapons but good example. I remember as a student in India reading Gandhi's autobiography, where he quotes a Gujarati poet:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For a bowl of water give a goodly meal;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For a kindly greeting bow thou down with zeal …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But the truly noble know all men as one,
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         And return with gladness good for evil done.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa" rel="nofollow">
          Mother Teresa
         </a>
         taught that good words are next to nothing without good deeds. The religions of India taught inner peace in the face of adversity. This land of the most ancient spirituality, of the exotic and of the familiar, has always made an impression on me. That is why 30 years ago I spent three months backpacking from Mumbai to Rajasthan, to Delhi, to Kashmir, around much of Bihar and back to Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia's second Prime Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Deakin" rel="nofollow">
          Alfred Deakin
         </a>
         , had also travelled to India, and he wrote, way back in 1893: India is truly a land of wonders and … extremes … a country of contrasts and contradictions, of splendour and poverty, profusion and barrenness, vicissitude and adventure …
        </p>
        <p>
         One hundred years ago, Deakin wanted Indian students to study in Australia, writing that Australia and India have much to teach each other. That is exactly what is now happening. For over a decade, up to 40,000 Indian students have been in Australia at any one time, and from next year, under the New Colombo Plan, Australia will be returning the compliment, by sending thousands of our own best and brightest to study at the universities of India.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a sign that we are finally grasping the opportunities that India presents. It was Prime Minister Howard who once said that Australia and India had so much in common but little to do with each other. That must change. Australia welcomes India's strength in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
          Indian Ocean
         </a>
         . Australia admires Prime Minister Modi's invitation to 'Come, Make in India,' which echoes our own determination that Australia will be 'open for business'. But, despite that, regrettably Australia only did $15 billion worth of business with India last year, and that hardly does justice to our two countries' potential.
        </p>
        <p>
         We want to be a dependable source of energy security, of resource security and of food security for India. If all goes to plan, next year an Indian company will begin Australia's largest ever coal development, which will light the lives of 100 million Indians for the next half-century. If all goes to plan—and no-one, if I may say so, has ever made the Indian bureaucracy perform as Prime Minister Modi did in Gujarat—by the end of next year we will have a free trade deal with what is potentially the world's largest market. I want to make this declaration here in this parliament: there are two can-do prime ministers in this chamber today, and we will make it happen. And, if all goes to plan, Australia will export uranium to India—under suitable safeguards of course—because cleaner energy is one of the most important contributions that Australia can make to the wider world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Geologists believe that somewhere between 130 million and 300 million years ago Australia and India actually shared the same landmass. We were, so to speak, joined at the geological hip. We cannot change continental drift, but we can ensure that we are closer friends and partners in the future than we have been in the recent past.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have never seen any leader as rapturously received in this country as Prime Minister Modi has been. And that is not just by the half-million Australians of Indian descent, and not just because the former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Minister
         </a>
         of Gujarat has never been a stranger to us. At least this should mean that it never again will be 28 years until the next prime ministerial visit. The cheering crowds sense that there is a natural affinity between Australia and India—a natural partnership for peace and prosperity. And they want us—they want both of us; they want all of us—to make the most of it.

         <p>
          Madam Speaker, I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet and I pay my respects to their elders both past and present. Prime Minister Modi, the applauding crowds that have greeted you around our country and here today in the house of the Australian people show how very welcome you are today. Might I also add: namaste.
         </p>
         <p>
          You are here today as the first Prime Minister born in an independent India, the proud son and a distinguished former
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister" rel="nofollow">
           Chief Minister
          </a>
          of your home state, the jewel of the west, Gujarat. Your part of India has gifted so much to the world: Gandhi's moral and intellectual leadership; centuries of poetry and literature; prime ministers; diplomats; Tata and other industrialists; public sector leaders; the world's most affordable motor car; and countless actors, writers and directors. And the Gujarati have always been travellers and adventurers. Along with their fellow citizens from every part of the land of light and freedom, they have made an international leap of faith. They have left behind the familiar songs, sights and stories of their childhood for a fresh start in our country. This glorious Indian diaspora is one of the great touchstones and powerful success stories of our marvellous multicultural society—thousands of Indian stories joining our great Australian story. And, of course, one of the firmest and fastest bonds that Indians form with Australians comes from our love of cricket.
         </p>
         <p>
          Prime Minister Modi, in Australia we sometimes say that being captain of our test team is the second toughest job in the country, behind Prime Minister. Some would say that we should never compare cricket with politics. After all, one is the cause of great national debates, intense passion, endless media commentary on controversial decisions and leadership speculation—and the other is just about deciding who governs Australia! In his 2011 Bradman oration, '
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall" rel="nofollow">
           The Wall
          </a>
          of India',
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid" rel="nofollow">
           Rahul Dravid
          </a>
          , reminded Australians that on 28 June 1930, when your illustrious predecessor
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru" rel="nofollow">
           Jawaharlal Nehru
          </a>
          was arrested by the British,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Donald_Bradman" rel="nofollow">
           Sir Donald Bradman
          </a>
          was busy decimating the English bowling attack, scoring 254 at Lord's. For Dravid and India's legendary cricket writer
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN" rel="nofollow">
           KN
          </a>
          Prabhu, this was the motif of the 1930s. As Nehru went in and out of jail, Bradman just stayed in, and the Australian went after the English like an avenging angel.
         </p>
         <p>
          Dravid also quoted Bradman's advice to a young
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Benaud" rel="nofollow">
           Richie Benaud
          </a>
          : 'Every cricketer is only a temporary trustee of the game.' Indeed, all of us—leaders, parliamentarians and citizens—are the temporary trustees of our international relationship. It is our duty to build upon our national and common values and mutual interests to elevate and broaden our friendship.
         </p>
         <p>
          The great significance of your visit, indeed your leadership, is the paradigm shift in Indian politics, from the politics of welfare to the politics of aspiration. I believe our task in this parliament is to build upon our economic relationship, the load-bearing pillar of the Australia-India friendship, to find that complementarity between what India needs for its growth and what Australia can supply—investment, energy, skills and training, services. And our interests are converging more broadly, on security and peace in the region, because India's great democratic character is not just about India; it has a resonance in our region and in the world.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mr Prime Minister, there is so much that binds us and so much that we share—the national day, a colonial past, faith in democracy, the rule of law, respect for diversity, a love of our vast, varied and fragile environments and a long tradition of bravery and sacrifice. I promise you, Prime Minister, that Australians will never forget 1,300 Indian troops who lost their lives on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
           Gallipoli Peninsula
          </a>
          . I promise you, Prime Minister, that Australians will never forget that Indians and Australians served, fought and fell with their face towards the foe from the deserts of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">
           North Africa
          </a>
          to the prisoner-of-war camps of South-East Asia. We have shared the duties of good international citizens in the service of peace—Korea, Somalia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Sudan and other missions. India has been the largest troop contributor to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations
          </a>
          missions, providing more than 160,000 troops in 43 United Nations missions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Prime Minister Modi, today, on behalf of the opposition, I want to pay special tribute to your passion for education and equality. We applaud your determination to bring dignity to the lives of every citizen—from ensuring and securing the active participation of woman power in development to bringing new amenity and sanitation to every community. We share your belief in education's hope-giving, life-changing, transforming power. We admire your great goal of freeing your people from poverty with the skills and knowledge that guard against the scourge of youth unemployment. Prime Minister, we know for you this is deeply personal—the product and the lesson of your own journey from hardship to the highest office in the land; a reflection of your determination to be a prime servant, a leader at one with the dreams of the people; a desire to give every member of India's next generation the chance, in Gandhi's words, 'to be the change [they] wish to see in the world' or—as you expressed it in that memorable equation—'
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
           IT
          </a>
          plus IT equals IT':

          Mr Prime Minister, one of Australia's greatest leaders,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chifley" rel="nofollow">
           Ben Chifley
          </a>
          , was a key supporter of Indian independence and a close friend of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_Nehru" rel="nofollow">
           Prime Minister Nehru
          </a>
          . These were two great men of grand vision—the authors of the 'Tryst with Destiny' and the 'Light on the Hill'. Just hours before his untimely death, Chifley conducted his last interview with the Indian media. His message that evening was pure Chifley—sincere and unadorned. He said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Tell Nehru not to lose heart but to carry on. India will still show the way to peace.
         </p>

          Prime Minister, you lead a great, peace-loving democracy with a renewed commitment to opportunity and equality. India does indeed, as Ben Chifley said, still show the way. You lead a nation that will shape our region and inspire our world. You honour us with this visit to the heart of our democracy. Welcome!

           came along! But, above all, we are united by the ideals of democracy.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today, as I stand in this temple of democracy, I consider nations such as ours to be blessed, because democracy offers the best opportunity for the human spirit to flourish, because we have the freedom to choose, the right to speak and the power to remove—and for us, in politics, no option but to leave with grace.
          </p>
          <p>
           Generations of people's representatives have made Australia one of the great nations of the world today. From the vast stretch of territory to the abundance of her resources, nature has been generous to you. But it is the people of Australia who have made Australia what it is today: a beacon of democracy and the rule of law; a nation that willingly leads the search for a lost aircraft; one of the most prosperous nations in the world, among the best on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index" rel="nofollow">
            Human Development Index
           </a>
           ; a nation with some of the best cities in the world, some of the most productive farms and mines, some of its best universities and research centres, and an advanced technology base; and a nation with great sporting skills.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australia evokes images not just of immense beauty but also of a great quality of life. Today, its cities are alive with the richness of this world's diversity. And it is home to 450,000 Indians, who are as proud to be part of Australia as they are of their Indian heritage.
          </p>
          <p>
           Honourable members, there was a time when, for many of us, Australia was a distant land on the southern edge of the world. Today, the world sees Australia to be at the heart of the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean region. This dynamic region holds the key to this world's future, and Australia is at its crossroads. And, as Australia has become more engaged with this part of the world, we welcome its growing role in driving this region's prosperity and shaping its security, because we, in India, seek the same future for this world. We also see Australia as a vital partner in India's quest for progress and prosperity. There are few countries in this world where we see so much synergy as we do in Australia—India, a nation of more than a billion seeking development; Australia, a developed country of a few million people and vast resources.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since the turn of this century, India has been the second fastest growing economy in the world. Millions have lifted themselves out of poverty into a new life of possibilities. Today, we have a government with a clear majority after 30 years. From the remotest village to the biggest cities, there is a new high tide of hope in India; a new energy. It is the energy of our youth. The 800 million people below the age of 35 are eager for change and willing to work for it because they now believe it is possible, that they can make it happen. It is this force of transformation that we will unleash.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the six months that we have been in office we have moved forward—thinking with ambition and acting with speed, seeking growth not just for growth but to transform the quality of life of every Indian. I see Australia as a major partner in every area of our national priority—in providing skills and education to our youth; a roof over every head and electricity in every household; the most affordable health care for the most difficult diseases; the next generation of infrastructure that does not take a toll on our environment; energy that does not cause our glaciers to melt—clean coal and gas, renewable energy and fuel for nuclear power—cities that are smart, sustainable and liveable; villages that offer opportunities; agriculture that yields more and farms that are better connected to markets; and practices and technologies that save water.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have a new mission for turning 'Made in India' into a global name—just as 'Computer in India' is. But we want to find new pathways to prosperity, not simply travel down the roads of the previous century. Much of India's future cities and infrastructure is yet to be built and so we have a unique opportunity to make our choices now. And in every sector—agriculture, food processing, mining, infrastructure, finance, technology and energy—from providing funds and resources through to technology and expertise, working as partners and investors Australia has immense opportunities to participate in India's progress. In turn, India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities and your desire to diversify your global economic engagement, your source for world-class skills at home or for a manufacturing location abroad. India's development, demography and demand provide a unique long-term opportunity for Australia—and all within the familiar framework of democracy. There is no other example of this nature in the world. Indian investors too are coming here in growing numbers and commitments.
          </p>
          <p>
           Honourable members, this is an age that is rich in promise but also filled with challenges. We can only pursue our dreams if we have the confidence that our cities are safe, our nations are secure, our region is stable and our world is peaceful. This vast region has many unsettled questions and new challenges. Historical differences persist, despite growing interdependence. The oceans are our lifelines. But we worry about access and security in our part of the world more than ever before. Our region has seen huge progress on the foundation of peace and stability, but we cannot take this for granted. Preserving it will be the most important task in the region. India and Australia can play their part in it by expanding our security cooperation and deepening our international partnerships in the region.
          </p>
          <p>
           But we do not have to rely on borrowed architecture of the past. Nor do we have the luxury to choose who we work with and who we do not, but what we do need is to work together and with others to create an environment and culture that promote the currency of coexistence and cooperation in which all nations, small and big, abide by international law and norms, even when they have bitter disputes. We should collaborate more on maintaining maritime security. We should work together on the seas and collaborate in international forums. We should work for a universal respect for international law and global norms.
          </p>
          <p>
           We must also support the process of economic integration across the region and an open global trading system that remains integrated. We must guard against regional trade initiatives becoming instruments of political competition. However, economic integration by itself will not be a strong basis for peace and stability without strong regional institutions. India and Australia are members of several institutions that are critical for the region and the world. We should connect more closely in the

           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Honourable members, in our interconnected world, our shared challenges extend beyond our region. Terrorism has become a major threat for us all. In India we have seen its face closely for three decades and we see it with the clarity that comes with it. Terrorism is changing in character and expanding in its reach. The internet has made recruitment and the call to violence self-generated. It also feeds off money laundering, drug trafficking and arms smuggling. We have to deepen our bilateral security cooperation, but we need a comprehensive global strategy for a global problem. It will require closer security cooperation but, even more, a policy of no distinction between terrorist groups or discrimination between nations—a resolve to isolate those who harbour terrorists, willingness to empower states that will fight them, a social movement against extremism in countries where it is most prevalent, and every effort to delink religion and terrorism.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I look to the future, we will also need to ensure that outer space and cyberspace remain instruments of connectivity and prosperity, not new frontiers of conflict. Responding to the region's disasters, combating proliferation and acting against piracy, we will work together on a full range of security challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
           Honourable members, since my government entered office no region has seen more intense engagement on India's part than the Asia-Pacific region, because we understand how deeply our future is linked to this region. India and Australia can play cricket hard with each other—and I suspect we will next month!—but we see Australia as one of our foremost partners in the region.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           So we stand together at a moment of enormous opportunity and great responsibility. I see a great future of partnership between India and Australia and a shared commitment to realise it. Prime Minister Abbott started us on this new journey in September. I have come here to set our two countries more firmly on that course—with your help, and with the help of the great people of India and Australia. I wish you the best for hosting a great and successful
