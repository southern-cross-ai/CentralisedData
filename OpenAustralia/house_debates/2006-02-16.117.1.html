        In January I had the great privilege of being a guest of the

        , the aircraft carrier that is named in honour of the former US President Ronald Reagan. Brisbane was the

        ’s first port of call overseas. It was very warmly welcomed by all Queenslanders. I had the great privilege of being a guest on this incredible warship, which the captain of the vessel called ‘97,000 tonnes of democracy’. This massive ship is home to 6,000 crew. It is 77 metres high, 344 metres long and 78 metres at its widest point. This 97,000 tonne aircraft carrier is the biggest vessel ever to visit Brisbane. The USS

        cost about $5 billion to build and costs about $3 million a day to operate. If you compare that to the Australian defence budget, which is about $17½ billion, it gives an indication of the sheer sums of money involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia and the United States are both committed to democratic and representative forms of government. We are committed to open and free markets, we believe in strong, robust and transparent economies and we are committed to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
         APEC
        </a>
        and free trade. Our two nations have much in common and this visit is a fine example of the strong relationship between us. I want to encourage the government to continue to work with the United States, and the United States with Australia, to improve the things we cherish and believe in, namely, democracy and greater human rights in countries of the world that might not subscribe to our views.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the member for the federal electorate of Ryan in the western suburbs of Brisbane, which it is my great privilege to represent, I will continue to very strongly advocate that this country remain a very close ally of the United States. Our relationship is enduring—the test of time reflects how close we are—and it is important for international and regional stability that the US have an important place in this part of the world. I finish my remarks by quoting the former US President Ronald Reagan. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the ultimate determinant in the struggle that’s now going on in the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas, a trial of spiritual resolve, the values we hold, the beliefs we cherish …
