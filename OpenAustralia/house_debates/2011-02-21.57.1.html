       Dear Mr Murphy
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post—closure of the Palm Beach Post Office
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 22 November 2010 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee’s consideration regarding the closure of the Palm Beach Post Office.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has noted that there has been a steady decline in customer numbers and, with up to 60 per cent fewer customers per day compared with similar post offices in the area, the Palm Beach Post Office is no longer commercially viable.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has advised that to ensure minimal inconvenience to its post office box customers, it is planning to relocate the boxes to the Elanora licensed post office which is approximately 2.4 km away at The Pines shopping centre. Customers may also opt to have their mail delivered to household or business addresses via the street mail delivery service. In this circumstance they would qualify for free mail redirection for six months.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I am informed that Australia Post has negotiated with a local newsagent, situated in
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       5th Avenue Palm Beach, to install a post point unit for local residents. This is a self service unit that provides access to a range of stock including stamps, pre-stamped envelopes, postpak packaging products and some satchels. The post point unit opened on Thursday, 25 November. Australia Post has indicated that all staff will be transferred to other outlets within the area.
      </p>

       I trust this information will be of assistance.
