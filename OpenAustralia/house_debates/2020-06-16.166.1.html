        Park and Yarranabbe Park, in my electorate of Wentworth, on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. For over 150 years, this area, once swampy land covered in tall rushes—hence the name—has been a place for people to get fresh air, exercise, enjoy views and enjoy entertainment.

        Making it Rushcutters Bay Park and Yarranabbe Park, in fact, was one of the largest harbour reclamation schemes for public recreation in New South Wales's history. Six acres for this park were set aside in 1878, and it was proclaimed in 1885, making it one of the earliest recreational spaces protected from development. This area has seen much history. It was the site of the famous

        It also hosted many of the famous pop and rock stars of the era, including The Beatles on their famous 1964 tour. The area includes the Reg Bartley Oval, named after a former lord mayor of Sydney, and the

        This listing on the State Heritage Register is the culmination of a long campaign to ensure that these two parks, Rushcutters Bay Park and Yarranabbe Park, have a high level of protection and are preserved for the benefit of many future generations to come. Today, I want to commend some of the local residents who have been involved in this long campaign to have the site heritage listed. I would like to acknowledge Andrew Woodhouse, the President of the Potts Point and Kings Cross Heritage and Residents Society, and all members of the society; Ms Charlotte Feldman, president of the Darling Point Society, and all the other members of the Darling Point Society; Ms Dixie Coulton, a local resident; Mr John Walton AM, another local resident and passionate supporter of the area; Mr John Bevel, a local resident; Ms Chicky Bray, a local resident and also a family friend of mine; and, finally, my state parliamentary colleague, Ms Gabrielle Upton MP, the New South Wales member for the seat of Vaucluse. All these residents and individuals have done a tremendous service to the residents of the area, to the people of Wentworth and to future generations in protecting and preserving these open spaces.
