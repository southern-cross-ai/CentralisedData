        It is disappointing that the Morrison government is failing to recognise that the aged-care sector is in complete crisis right now, and the lack of response and the lack of planning from both the minister and the Prime Minister is just not good enough. Of course, we want every elderly Australian to get high-quality care, and, to get that quality care, we need amazing people to support them. Unfortunately, at the moment 60 per cent of aged-care workers haven't had their booster shot. At least 60,000 residents still haven't had their booster shot. The Prime Minister said it wasn't a race to get vaccines in arms, but it still is a race, and he has gone missing in action.

        A quarter of aged-care worker shifts are not being filled. Wounds aren't being tended to, and residents are not getting food and water. This is having real-life consequences. Of course, one of the consequences of not filling these shifts is that families remain separated. This is why Brenda, a resident from Seaford Rise, was separated from her mother, who was 95, unable to see and unable to hear. Their only communication is through touch. Yet, because of the staff shortages in aged care, Brenda was told she could not see her mother. She could not have that experience. Shame on this government!
