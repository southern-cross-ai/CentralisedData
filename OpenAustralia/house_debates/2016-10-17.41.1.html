        I was very pleased on Saturday to attend the Chinderah 1st
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Scout Hall
        </a>
        , where I had the great honour of cutting the cake celebrating 100 years of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cub_Scout" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        movement. The Chinderah
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cub_Scouts" rel="nofollow">
         Cub Scouts
        </a>
        celebrated with a weekend full of fun activities and camping at Chinderah Scouts grounds. More than 100 people attended, including Cub Scouts from across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        region, Scout leaders and parents. It was also wonderful to catch up with my good friends and local Scout leaders, Owen and Bridget Kirk. I acknowledge their and their family's commitment to scouts over many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cub Scouts programs emphasise exciting and challenging activities for all those involved. Of course, 2016 marks the start of the 100th year of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cub_Scouting" rel="nofollow">
         Cub Scouting
        </a>
        . Since it was originally founded in 1916, generations of young people have embarked on an adventure filled with laughter, excitement and friendship. The Cub Scouts was established in response to the growing demand from youngsters who were not old enough to join Scouts but wanted to be involved. Cub Scouts is for those aged between eight and 11 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are over 13 million Cub Scouts throughout the world, and they are all preparing to celebrate the centenary of Cub Scouts, such as those at Chinderah did on Saturday. A 100 Cub Scots centenary logo comprising a stylised wolf's paw print, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Scout_Emblem" rel="nofollow">
         World Scout Emblem
        </a>
        , has been created to mark this very significant milestone. Congratulations to the Cubs for 100 years. I hope they all enjoy the celebrations both here and throughout the world.
