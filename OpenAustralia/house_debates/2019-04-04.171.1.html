        Benny Muldoon is a very well known and loved identity in and around Lismore. Benny attended Wilson Park Special School during his primary years. After turning 18, he worked at Summerland House Farm, formally known as House With No Steps, and he recently received a medal for his dedication to the job after 35 years' service at the farm. From customers to staff, he greets them with a smile. He will go out of his way to help people and is very well known there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Benny also loves his sport. He's a life member of the Marist Brothers Rams Rugby League Club, a president of the Lismore City Rugby Club and an avid Broncos' fan and Queensland supporter in

        . I forgive you for that, Benny!
       </p>
       <p>
        His dedication to the Rams earned him his nickname, Benny the Ram. He's one of the hardest workers at the club, and he's also their mascot. Before every home game he sets up the pads on the posts, he puts out the bins, he sets up the canteen and does the barbecue. At every Christmas event he plays

        , and he even has his own Santa business card. At one time, Benny was a regular on local radio station 2LM, sharing his footy tips every week with Neil Marks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Benny's mother, Janice, worked hard to ensure that Benny would be able to live independently after she passed. She bought him a small house. After her death 11 years ago he has looked after himself ever since. He has two sisters, Mara and Jane, who are very proud of their brother. Benny, congratulations on reaching your milestone of 35 years at Summerland House Farm. Your mother would be very proud of you, and so are we.

        Dakoda Walters from Angourie has just finished competing in the Key Sun Zinke Sydney Pro Junior surfing event in Manly, where he finished runner-up in his first pro junior final. This has put him in the world top 5 of junior surfers. I want to congratulate him on that. I also want to acknowledge other local surfers who are doing very well. Chris Zaffis from Angourie is ranked 110th in the men's qualifying series, Taj Watson from Moonee Beach is 13th in the junior series, Callum Robson is 96th in the men's qualifying series, Zack McMahon from
