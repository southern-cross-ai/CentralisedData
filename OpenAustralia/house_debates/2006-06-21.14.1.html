        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government is proud of its record in funding vaccines. Commonwealth government expenditure on vaccines has increased 22-fold from $13 million in 1996 to $285 million last year. The proof of the success of the National Immunisation Program (NIP) can be measured by the declines in rates of preventable diseases and, in the case of polio and smallpox, eradication of the diseases from Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The largest vaccination program ever undertaken in Australia, the National Meningococcal C Vaccination Program, has already achieved significant results. In 2002, before the program started, there were 213 cases of this disease reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. By 2005 this had reduced to 40 cases, a decrease of 81 per cent. Deaths from meningococcal C have also declined by 83 per cent in this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government provides funds to state and territory governments to purchase vaccines under the National Immunisation Program. The states and territories then provide the vaccines free of charge to providers so that the target population can be immunised.
       </p>
       <p>
        Funds are also provided to state and territory governments to assist with any pre- and post-vaccine tests that may be required. In addition, the government also provides state and territory governments with assistance in procuring goods and services related to vaccine provisionâ€”for example, storage and delivery.
       </p>
       <p>
        This

         bill
        </a>
        is a minor administrative amendment that preserves the current funding arrangements between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. This allows the continuation of activities such as vaccine storage and distribution. The amendment in this bill will come into effect after the bill receives royal assent.
       </p>
       <p>
        A strong National Immunisation Program is important. As new and more complex vaccines are developed, steps must be taken to ensure that the immunisation program is as efficient and effective as possible. We need to put into place arrangements that enable the NIP to respond to these future challenges. This is not a major bill but it is important, and I commend it to the House.
