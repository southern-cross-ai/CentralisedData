       <p>
        I bring to the House's attention the continued incompetence of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Water" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Water
        </a>
        , as well as their lack of support and provision for infrastructure for Austral. When I was elected in 2008 to the Liverpool council, planning was already well established for significant development and growth, for more than 300,000 new residents. Fourteen years later, we see the New South Wales government and Sydney Water act like they're surprised about it! It was in fact the New South Wales government approving these releases and plans for Austral a decade ago. They've known that infrastructure would be required to support this growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people in Austral have had to endure unreasonable delays in key infrastructure that was meant to be completed in 2018 by Sydney Water. They've planned new houses and bought land, with the expectation and promise that stormwater and wastewater systems would be ready to handle the thousands of new residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The incompetence of the New South Wales government has caused unreasonable stress to so many. We have people who, due to sunset clauses in their contracts, stand to lose their dream of ever owning a home. We have older Australians who want fair compensation for the acquisition of their land. It is incredible that, 50 years after Whitlam fought for sewerage in the suburbs, the fight still has to continue. I call on the New South Wales government to provide the infrastructure to make their dream homes come true. It's about time.
