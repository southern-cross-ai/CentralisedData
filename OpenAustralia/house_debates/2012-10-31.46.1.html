       <p>
        At its recent triennial conference in Canberra, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council" rel="nofollow">
         National Council
        </a>
        of Women of Australia presented me with a petition demanding 'a more civil and dignified approach to parliamentary debate at the federal level and for greater respect to be demonstrated to the office of the Prime Minister'. The petition, which was signed by more than 700 women across Australia, went on to say that the 'increasingly crude, juvenile, disrespectful and overly combative behaviour of many members degrades parliamentary process, creates an inappropriate behavioural model for our youth and causes ridicule in the eyes of world nations'. According to the conference organisers, the petition was triggered by a speech I gave to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        arm of the council in May. In that speech, I said that, for most of the time, parliament is 'a functioning, calm and respectful' place. I want decent and civilised debate on issues that matter in Australia, devoid of personal attack, particularly on the grounds of gender.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am calling on leaders on all sides of the media and politics and in the community to invoke the values and spirit of two of Australia's greatest prime ministers, so beautifully articulated in a sign along the

        I present the petition.
