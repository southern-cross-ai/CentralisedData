        It was my absolute privilege recently to present the Legion d'Honneur to Mr Henry Houldsworth of

        in my electorate of Richmond. The order is France's highest military decoration, and it recognised Mr Houldsworth's service as a diver in the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The presentation occurred at the Winders Place nursing home, where, to Henry's surprise, a number of proud family and friends had gathered to celebrate this amazing honour. Henry had no idea he was about to be presented with this prestigious award. At 94 years of age, he, along with the others present, was overcome with emotion with him receiving such a high honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Henry was an apprentice fitter and turner, and on completion of his apprenticeship he joined the British Royal Navy. After training, he was posted to the small boat squadron of special forces in Dartmouth. After almost a year in the Royal Navy, Henry saw a notice calling for volunteers with mechanical knowledge to undertake a diving course. The course taught the use of underwater welding, salvaging and clearance of explosives. The divers wore a one-piece green rubber suit, a charcoal bag on the chest and an oxygen bottle on the back. In the Royal Navy, the suit was referred to as 'the slimy green suit of death' because it was so incredibly dangerous.
       </p>
       <p>
        On completion of the course, Henry was posted to the Landing Craft Recovery Unit as a diver, and it was with this group that he went to D-Day. Upon landing at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Sword Beach
        </a>
        , all they had was a truck, bulldozer, a jeep, a motorbike and approximately 20 personnel. The group's main assignment was to clear the beach of any sunken or damaged vessels and to clear the underwater obstacles so that vessels could land directly on the beach. To clear the underwater obstacles, Henry would locate them and the bulldozer would drag them onto the beach. Low or high tide, this had to be completed for beach approaches. They were under some artillery fire for several days and were subjected to a strafing from a German fighter who took several passes at them. They were able to save themselves by lying parallel to the seawall. They were on the beach for nine weeks and were billeted in Lion-sur-Mer, the first village in France to be liberated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two of Henry's brothers, Danny and Bill, were also at D-day, while another brother, Bob, died as a prisoner of war in Burma. In 1950, Henry migrated to Australia with his wife, Pat, and son, John, who also, later, served in the Navy. His grandson Steven served in the Army. Henry was a top football player as well and represented the Royal Navy numerous times.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the day of the presentation, as well as being presented with the award, Henry received a letter from the French ambassador which read:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        France will never forget the thousands of soldiers, like you and your two brothers, who were there on D-day, who came to fight on French battlefields and we still remain grateful today.
       </p>

        Thanks so much to Henry Houldsworth for his service, and special thanks to his family for inviting me to be a part of a very special occasion in presenting the Legion of Honour to Henry Houldsworth.
