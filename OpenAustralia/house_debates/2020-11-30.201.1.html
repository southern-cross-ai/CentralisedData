        have overcome one of the most challenging years in their school careers, and they're helping others in need. Their first year at high school hasn't been anything like what they would have expected, but these inspiring kids have still been able to focus on social justice, helped by a visit from Zoe Grant of the

        . They were so motivated by what they learnt that they've organised a food drive to help refugees and asylum seekers.

They believed it was important because, 'for refugees and asylum seekers in

        These kids have risen to the challenge of overcoming their own problems and are giving others a helping hand. Bede encourages students to strive for excellence and to equip themselves with the skills and passion to make a difference in the community and that's what these kids are doing. I would like congratulation them for not only raising awareness of the struggles that refugees and asylum seekers face but for taking practical steps to help. Congratulations, year 7.
