       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to express my sympathy for the residents of Collinsville, Sarina, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Pioneer Valley
        </a>
        and surrounds. I am sure the last 24 hours have been harrowing, but please know you have the Australian government's full support. As Tropical Cyclone Debbie receded overnight, our thoughts and prayers now turn to action. The priority now is recovery and ensuring the impact on lives and livelihoods is minimised. The effect of Tropical Cyclone Debbie on Capricornia has been multifaceted, highlighting the span of the region. I have spoken with the five mayors that cover my electorate, and their concerns are as diverse as the region itself. At this time, it is vital that the communities in outlying areas are not neglected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Collinsville has been badly affected. While the cyclone passed through the mining town as a category 2, many of the homes there are fibro. They have, therefore, sustained significant damage. Power lines and trees are down and communications have been cut. It is a community that is proud and tough and where neighbour takes care of neighbour. Prior to the storms hitting, local construction company Up Built assisted residents to prepare properties free of charge. Although communication lines to the mine site are still down, Glencore Mines have reported that there has been no damage to critical infrastructure and that everyone is safe. While production remains suspended, they are hoping to resume within the next 24 hours, with employees due to return to work today and tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Sarina, Woolworths now has power, and shops are starting to open. There is still significant flooding, especially around Jackson Street and Range Road, but the rain continues. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Highway
        </a>
        is now open into Sarina, but water around the showgrounds is still rising, so it may be cut off from the north.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Pioneer Valley, water is now the enemy. We have been speaking to locals in the sugarcane industry. The wind and rain overnight has left hundreds of hectares of sugarcane crops flattened. The relentless rain is preventing them from assessing the damage, but there is anticipation of at least 25 per cent in losses. The longer the rain continues, the higher the damage, as the sugar cane becomes waterlogged. A large percentage of crops appear to have snapped, rendering the cane useless. It will be another 48 hours until the full extent of damage is known.
       </p>
       <p>
        The area affected by Tropical Cyclone Debbie accounts for about 29 per cent of total agricultural production in Queensland, based on 2011 ABS statistics—that is, 21 per cent of farm businesses in Queensland. Seventy per cent of Queensland's sugar cane comes from this region. With harvest set to start in under three months, the financial impacts on these farm businesses will be huge, but right now we need to get them out of their isolation and get their electricity back on so that they can get back on track. Of particular concern are the industries that keep these regions alive—mining, tourism and agriculture. The longer it takes for these industries to reopen, the longer the economic impact on the communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I applaud the efforts of every level of government and the swift action taken by the Prime Minister to deploy the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . These forces proved essential following Cyclone Marcia. The speed of deployment for this event will make recovery that much easier for people on the ground. The Insurance Council of Australia has declared a catastrophe event for the damage caused by Tropical Cyclone Debbie. Insurance companies have been quick to show support. The Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, jointly funded by the Australian government and state governments, have been activated for affected regions in Capricornia. We have had some practice and we are getting very good at responding to extreme weather events. The people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        are resilient. At times like this, the best of us shines through. But we cannot be complacent. The people of these regions will need our ongoing support to get back on track.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing I can say for sure is: I hope the member for Melbourne does not take sugar in his latte because he will certainly be getting a very bitter taste from the canegrowers of Central and
