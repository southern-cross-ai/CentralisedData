       <p>
        I would like to wish all our Paralympians the very best of luck in Rio and acknowledge those who have already competed and those competing in the coming days. In particular, I would like to mention two outstanding athletes from the Tweed, both of whom have huge community support. Firstly, swimmer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Wilson" rel="nofollow">

        lives in Kingscliff and is a student at Mount Saint Patrick College at Murwillumbah. Recently, college principal Paul Clohesy in the

        that Kate Wilson was given a hero's farewell from students, staff and school, and as school community over the moon with excitement. 'Everyone here is rapt', he said. 'We farewelled Kate officially with an assembly before she left. It was really exciting.' Kate is competing in a number of swimming races, including the 4 x 50 metre freestyle relay, the 50-metre freestyle, the 200-metre individual medley, the 100-metre breaststroke and the 100-metre freestyle.

        Our other athlete from the Tweed is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Chaffey" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Chaffey
        </a>
        , a local policeman who is a paratriathlete. Bill is Australia's most successful paratriathlete: he has won five paratriathlon world championships. Bill did finish in first place in his fourth place in his race in Rio. This is a major achievement, and one we are very proud of. Bill's commitment to physical endurance events predates an accident that left him badly injured. Five days before he was to contest his first Ironman triathlon in 2005, Bill was hit from behind by a truck while cycling, leaving him paralysed from the hips down . Bill's skill and resilience make him a great role model to his police colleagues and to the broader community. He is a true champion.
       </p>
       <p>
        To both Kate and Bill: you are an inspiration to so many people in our community, and I wish you the best of luck in all of your future endeavours.
