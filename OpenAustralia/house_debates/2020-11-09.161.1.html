       <p>
        Today I would like to give a big-shout out to all my constituents in Barton. We all know that 2020 has been a tough year for all. As we move into the festive season next month, I would like to wish all of Barton all the very best for next year. I'd like to acknowledge all the frontline workers who have kept us safe through the pandemic and all the doctors, nurses, hospital staff, cleaners and health workers. I also want to acknowledge the work of many volunteer groups in Barton for their tireless work to support our community through this pandemic.
       </p>

        I had the pleasure of visiting Jack and Jill Preschool in Bexley a few weeks ago. The preschool were celebrating their 70th anniversary. I was joined on the day by my colleague, Chris Minns, the state member for Kogarah; Liz Barlow, Bayside Council councillor; and Kurranulla Aboriginal Corporation chairperson, Deanna Schreiber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the challenges of social distancing and no attendance of parents, the preschool put on a wonderful morning tea. The morning included a smoking ceremony and a welcome to countryâ€”a really great experience for the children. To Maureen and other committee members, congratulations on a wonderful morning. To all the teachers and staff: congratulations on the wonderful job you do there for the children. Thank you for the extraordinary morning, and well done on reaching the 70th anniversary, with hopefully many more to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also rise today to offer my best wishes to all the year 12 students in Barton who are commencing their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        written examinations. This has been a tough year for all of us, but no more so than for our students from kindergarten to year 12. HSC students, you have spent 13 years preparing for these exams. They're important, but they're not everything. There are great futures ahead for you, be it

        , university or other avenues you would like to pursue. I finish by saying to the year 12 students: make sure you enjoy this last experience of school life, and remember that, when you finish your final exam, it will be the start of your next adventure. They say that, when one door closes another door opens, and that's true for life in general. To everyone at Jack and Jill Preschool, to the wonderful health workers, carers and volunteer workers in Barton, and particularly to the HSC students, I wish you well into the future, and thank you.
