       <p>
        I rise today to give a big shout-out to two amazing independent public school principals in my electorate of

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in May to participate in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS" rel="nofollow">
         IPS
        </a>
        Principals' Fellowship Program. Both women well deserve this opportunity to expand their horizons as leaders and innovators, through Harvard's Graduate School of Education.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have visited both of their schools and was impressed by the provision of education and amenity that the IPS system allows. Maxine and Kerry have complete autonomy and are responsible for staff recruitment, financial management, governance and accountability. I know Maxine has hand-picked specialist teachers who suit the particular needs of her student cohort, giving consideration to the broader multicultural community. At Kerry's school, with many students coming from an agricultural background, a self-sustaining farm, timber plantation and vocational education and training program teaches important trade skills relevant to local career opportunities. I commend both women for tailoring their school's services to provide support beyond the curriculum for their students. Currently, more than half of WA's 800 government schools are now IPS, so to be selected as two of the 20 WA representatives for this Harvard fellowship is a real accolade.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to note the federal government has funded 75 per cent of this fellowship program, and I know Maxine and Kerry will capitalise on this valuable opportunity to enhance their knowledge, mentor their peers and guide the direction of WA education into the future.
