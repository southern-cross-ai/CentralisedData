       <p>
        While I have this opportunity tonight before the House, I wish to acknowledge the passing of a Brisbane identity and a terrific Australian—Dominic Condon. Dom, as he was known to his friends, passed away on 21 August 2020 after a courageous battle against brain cancer. He remained positive throughout. He fought with great tenacity. He beat it back. But, ultimately, it re-emerged and claimed his life. He was just 43. But more tragic than his young age is that he has had to leave behind his young boys, Callahan and Langdon. I have never had the privilege of meeting his boys, but he spoke about them to me often—about how much he enjoyed the love of cricket that they shared. I know he was more proud of them than of anything else in this world.
       </p>
       <p>
        I won't pretend that I was Dom's nearest and dearest; there will be plenty who can claim the honour of knowing him better. But he was a very good mate. We moved in the same circles in Brisbane. We worked on campaigns together and we shared many enjoyable lunches and conversations over the years, including a very enjoyable one at the iconic Breakfast Creek Hotel in Brisbane. He was a commercial property agent and fund manager by trade. He was a passionate supporter of the values of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        . He was a true believer. For all his dedicated support, he never asked for a single thing in return; all of us in politics know that you can't say that about too many.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, more important than that, I will remember Dom as a man of extraordinary kindness. He was a genuinely nice and humble guy—a true gentleman who, no matter how hard you tried, you could never convince to say a bad word about anyone. It just was not in his nature. He was always on the other end of the phone with a kind word, a compliment and a positive attitude that was infectious. There are a lot of crummy guys in the world who seem to live forever, but he was one of the good guys and he deserved more time to spend with his young family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dom will be laid to rest on 28 August at St William's Catholic Church in Grovely, in my electorate of Ryan. I can't be there, unfortunately, as I'll be here with all of you in Canberra. So, instead, I hope that this short recognition in our national parliament of his exemplary service and character can be my contribution to honouring him and his memory. My heart goes out to Christina and his boys. I know that their grief right now will be almost too much to bear.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dom was one of the quiet Australians who, without fanfare, just went about his work, and in doing so lifted up his city, his community and those around him who were lucky enough to have him in their lives. His many, many friends, who, like me, were lucky enough to have him touch their lives, will miss him greatly. Rest in peace, Dom.
