       </p>
       <p>
        This bill, which is the fourth and final tranche of legislation implementing the government's MySuper and governance reforms, was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on 29 November last year. On 5 February this year the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJC" rel="nofollow">
         PJC
        </a>
        reported and made nine recommendations, eight substantive recommendations and a recommendation that the bill be passed after due consideration of the PJC's report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has accepted six of the eight recommendations and this bill will implement four of them. A fifth will be implemented by upcoming regulations and a sixth does not require regulation. The changes recommended by the PJC will provide trustees with more information, in the event that APRA issues them with an infringement notice, and greater clarity about the penalties involved. The service provider provision will be amended so that a fund's governing rules would void only to the extent they compel a trustee to use a particular service provider.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to these changes the government is introducing a number of other amendments, some of which have been suggested by industry, which will enhance the MySuper reforms and improve flexibility. The amendments will allow trustees to have a single fixed cap on percentage based administration fees. The cap will reduce the risk that some members could be charged significant amounts in administration fees which are likely to exceed the costs of administering the member's funds. Amendments will also prevent trustees from undermining the intent of MySuper by ensuring that members can hold both MySuper and choice products if they wish to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the bill will make consequential amendments reflecting the change in title of Fair Work Australia to the Fair Work Commission. In addition, the amendments will improve the quality and relevance of information in the 'product dashboard' about a MySuper product's performance by providing for the details to be set out in regulations and by providing trustees with more time to prepare for the reporting of their portfolio holdings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government will also introduce further amendments in response to targeted industry consultation. These amendments will clarify that the legislation is not intended to prohibit the use of related parties, provided the trustee complies with the trustee covenants and other related legislation. These further amendments will also address concerns relating to the direction of contributions provisions by carving out certain existing products such as risk in capital guarantee products from the direction of contributions requirements in sections 29WA and 29WB, including regulation-making powers so that a direction given to the trustee of another fund can be relied upon by the trustee of a successor fund and amending the existing direction arrangements so that only directions given after 31 March 2013 are required to be in writing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has chosen not to implement two recommendations of the PJC. The first is recommendation 1, in which the PJC suggested imposing time limits on a member's ability to request reasons for decisions from trustees in relation to a complaint made by that member. The PJC indicated that record-keeping and a trustee's ability to respond to a request for reasons would decline as time passed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government does not support this recommendation because it would mean that members could complain about decisions but could not have access to the reasons for those decisions. This is not consistent with the notion of procedural justice and fairness. In addition, as industry noted at the PJC hearings, there are already a range of record-keeping requirements in the superannuation sector and the bill, as introduced, does not impose an undue burden on trustees. Trustees are currently obliged to keep records and files for compliance with general trust law obligations, possible legal action and information-gathering powers of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_Complaints_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
         Superannuation Complaints Tribunal
        </a>
        . In that context, a requirement to provide members with reasons for decisions is appropriate and not burdensome.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government also does not support recommendation 7 of the PJC. The PJC has suggested removing schedule 1, item 71, from the bill on the grounds that both it and item 70 make the same amendment to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 using slightly different numbering, so there might be a drafting error. However, this item is a contingent amendment and is required because another bill before the parliament, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Reducing Illegal Early Release and Other Measures) Bill 2012 seeks to amend the same section. Depending on which bill receives royal assent first, either item 70 or item 71 will amend the

         As I have already stated, the coalition will allow the government's amendments to pass through this parliament. However, as I said in my speech on the second reading on this bill, the government has once again been forced to bring in a raft of changes to its own legislation after it has been introduced. As I mentioned, the government's amendments follow the outcomes of the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into this bill, which found many serious issues that the government had not dealt properly with. I recognise and welcome that industry input and coalition scrutiny have enhanced this bill. It is good to see that the government does occasionally recognise its mistakes and adopts the measures and good ideas put forward by the coalition, such as the cap on fees.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I have stated in relation to the product dashboard, the coalition puts this government on notice that they have to be balanced in their approach when designing the regulations and not to favour their mates who are in industry superannuation funds. The coalition reserves the right to pursue amendments to the legislation to fix this issue, should the government not get the balance right.

         review recommended an end to the equal representation model on superannuation boards under which union and employer representatives dominate industry superannuation funds. For the record let me recap recommendation 2.7. It said:

         For those boards that have equal representation because their company constitutions or other binding arrangements so require, the

         S Act should be amended so that no less than one‐third of the total number of member representative trustee‐directors must be non‐associated and no less than one‐third of employer representative trustee‐directors must be non‐associated.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has failed to act on this recommendation from its own, much-heralded Cooper review into superannuation.
        </p>
        <p>
         On behalf of the coalition I am moving amendments which will enact the following principles: (1) that existing equal representation requirements in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and regulations be repealed; (2) that these be replaced by requirements which give effect to the principle that each affected trustee board or group of trustees at a minimum will contain one-third in number independent directors or trustees; (3) for the purpose of independents it will take the meaning of section 10 in the SI(S) Act; (4) the independence rule would only be applied to public offer funds. The coalition views this amendment to be serious in nature and, should our amendment not be successful here today, we will continue to push for this should we be offered the opportunity to form government for this great commonwealth, Australia, at the next election.

          I always listen very carefully to the member for Dunkley because he puts his arguments in at least a pleasant fashion. Unfortunately, he has failed to persuade the government on this occasion, though not for want of trying.
         </p>
         <p>
          The opposition has proposed an amendment to the bill which would require a minimum of one-third directors on public offer funds. The government considers the current arrangements requiring equal representation remain appropriate in ensuring members are able to participate in the management and protection of their retirement savings. One of the reasons we support this is that I do not believe there would be another sector of the Australian economy which is worth $450 billion where the ideologues of the far Right would say, 'Let us change the way they are working.' What is the case for change? The case was never made out other than that it was a recommendation in a particular review, but we never unpack it beyond that. Since that review was written we have given APRA the powers to look through the governance of individual funds, and they are able to do that. APRA have advised me that they are well satisfied with the powers they now enjoy courtesy of this government—which, incidentally, were voted against by those opposite.
         </p>
         <p>
          So we have the regulator saying that the current system is working well. We have a sector of industry $450 billion large; but, because there is employee content, because sometimes there are union reps on it, the ideologues hear the dog whistle, start frothing and say, 'We must intervene in this sector of the economy because we don't like the fact that the workers sometimes have a voice in their superannuation.' This argument does not reflect well. Why tinker with a system that is not broken? There has never been any evidence that industry funds deserve any more bias, prejudice, bile and bigotry from the anti-union baiters opposite than any other set of funds.
         </p>
         <p>
          If that does not convince you, let me now also advise you of the latest APRA data from June 2012: the annual statistics bulletin. We hear that dreadful word that must send the opposition bean counters into a state of panic: statistics. The super funds managed—and this is what the statistical record shows as opposed to the ideological polemic, bias and bigotry of some of those opposite; the rancid, turgid ongoing contributions we hear bagging unions; turgid and rancid, although admittedly pleasantly put by the member for Dunkley—

          I exempt the member for Dunkley from the references of 'turgid' and 'rancid'. But, having done that, no more leave passes for some of the others who have spoken. These statistics show—and I can see the opposition putting their hands over their ears like children before bedtime not wanting to hear the news—that super funds managed under the equal representation trustee system have on average outperformed the retail fund sector over the medium to long term. How can this be so if the governance structure which the opposition legislative helicopters want to invade and overturn, trashing in pursuit of their far-right ideology—if this structure is so bad and APRA says they have enough powers to look through the governance of funds—is outperforming the retail sector? This cannot be right. Black must be white! Rain must be sun! We do not know, but don't let a fact or statistic get in the way of the right-wing extremists!
         </p>
         <p>
          The government has already made legislative changes which will apply from 1 July 2013. We have raised the obligations of directors to manage superannuation fund assets prudently in the best interests of members. We have made sure that directors have to give priority to beneficiaries. We have required the disclosure of directors' remuneration. From 1 July, APRA prudential standards will require funds to maintain registers of relevant duties and interests. Regulations will require mandatory disclosure of conflicts of interest. To get a lecture from those opposite saying, '

          review said recommendation X.Y; we must follow this and, if we don't follow this, it makes what we're doing wrong'—if they are such advocates of the Cooper review, why did they fight harder than anything we have seen since their attack on the carbon price? The Cooper report recommended that the opt-in requirement apply to the provision. The Cooper review recommended intrafund advice be provided. The opposition opposes Cooper review recommendations when it does not suit their ideology, but otherwise they would run amuck with $450 billion of workers' money.

                   <p>
                    Thank you for your protection, Madam Speaker. The reinventing the parliament agreement was not a legally binding document and has been departed from by the government and the crossbenchers on numerous occasions. So I will not have any hypocrisy from the crossbenchers or the government about the reinventing the parliament agreement. The only matters out of the reinventing the parliament agreement that were binding on this chamber were those that were transmuted to the standing orders. The Leader of the House has on several occasions relied on that to not abide by the reinventing the parliament agreement in this place. He might now rue the fact that on several occasions over the last three years he has said, if it is not in the standing orders, it does not stand for anything.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The truth is that the government, the opposition and the crossbenchers agreed that, if a member of parliament missed a division for an inadvertent but good reason, we would consider resubmitting a bill or an amendment to the chamber. Four Labor members of parliament, including one whip, failed to take their pagers, which tell us what is going on in the chamber, to the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
                     Great Hall
                    </a>
                    , which is a matter of a few hundred metres away. That is not the kind of reason that was regarded as significant enough, even in the reinvented parliament agreement. We discussed at that time that this courtesy could be extended if a member was suddenly ill, was locked in a room and could not escape for whatever reason—as occurred on one occasion in this place some years ago—was in hospital or had an immediate family crisis which required their attention and they could not possibly come. It was not for situations where four members of parliament do not take their beepers to the Great Hall or pay attention to what was going on in the chamber.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    For that reason, the coalition will not give leave for this motion. But, if the Leader of the House wants to withdraw his motion and negotiate with the opposition over the course of the rest of the day about this matter, we will listen to the arguments and do so in good faith.
