        On behalf of the government and the people of Australia, I congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Truss" rel="nofollow">
         Liz Truss
        </a>
        on her election as the new leader of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        Conservative Party. Shortly, she will be commissioned as the 56
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
        </a>
        . She will be the third woman to hold that historic office. It is a special privilege to be chosen to lead your party, and it's an extraordinary honour to have the chance to lead your country. I can imagine—indeed, I can recall from not so long ago—the powerful mixture of emotions that comes with being elected to such high office.
       </p>
       <p>
        In June, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
         NATO
        </a>
        summit in Spain, I had the chance to meet with Ms Truss in her capacity as foreign secretary. We shared a platform as the guest speakers at the NATO summit, convened by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Spain" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Minister of Spain
        </a>
        , to talk about the global challenges which we face, including, of course, the Russian intervention in Ukraine, the strategic competition in our region and the need to uphold the international rule of law. I look forward to having a further discussion with the new Prime Minister shortly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Truss will walk through that famous black door of 10
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Downing Street
        </a>
        at a time when the people of Britain are facing very serious challenges. Out of the deep and abiding affection that Australians have for our oldest ally and oldest friend, we wish her well in the service of her country.

        <p>
         I join the Prime Minister in his words of congratulations to the incoming
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          British Prime Minister
         </a>
         . We congratulate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Truss" rel="nofollow">
          Liz Truss
         </a>
         on her elevation, her election as the next
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">
          Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
         </a>
         . I had the great pleasure of meeting with Liz during the Australian-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         ministerial consultations in January when I was defence minister and she was foreign secretary. As I wrote in my statement last night, Liz is an incredibly intelligent, pragmatic and, indeed, courageous leader. She'll not only make a fine Prime Minister but also lead Britain through challenges both domestic and international.
        </p>
        <p>
         In her victory speech, Liz promised to deliver on the energy crisis. We're watching with interest Britain's response to the energy crisis, and, indeed, their great, enduring interest in nuclear technology and small modular reactors.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom also understands that the resurgence of authoritarianism poses one of the greatest threats of our times, hence her priorities outlined in a speech last December to build a network of liberty and advance the frontiers of freedom. In these testing times, Liz will be the strongest of leaders to advance our two nations in mutual security and economic objectives, including, most importantly, through AUKUS.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also wish to acknowledge the legacy and achievements of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson" rel="nofollow">
          Boris Johnson
         </a>
         , a true friend to our country. Today, as we welcome a new British Prime Minister and farewell another, Australia and the United Kingdom remain the best of partners and the dearest of friends.
