        CONAGHAN () (): I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge a local young gun whose initiative and dedication has garnered a national award. Hugo Northam is a year 11 student at Saint Columba Anglican School, in

        Hugo is an enthusiast of both the ocean and technology and has a keen sense of community, having been at the Tacking Point Surf Life Saving Club for many years. He put up his hand to be a drone operator and help protect swimmers on our local beaches. It was a no-brainer for this young, passionate man. After a few short months, Hugo proved his worth to the program through his willingness to learn and obvious respect for the strict protocols that operations of this kind require, as well as the high standard of jobs that he was logging. Thank you for your passion and your dedication to our community, Hugo. I know that you have a bright future ahead of you.

        I'd also like to dedicate time to acknowledge Liz Campbell, former

        </a>
        this year. Liz has been recognised for her service to local government during her 14 years as a Kempsey Shire councillor. I had the pleasure of working alongside Liz quite often in her role as mayor, which she held over a decade. Originally elected as a councillor in 2008, Liz was then elected as mayor in 2012. In fact, she is the very first Kempsey mayor to be democratically elected by the community. That's a testament to her popularity and the positive impact that she had already made as a councillor.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the moment that she was elected to council in 2008, Liz consistently led with dedication and vision. Through fires, floods and pandemics she advocated and delivered some incredible projects, including the Macleay Valley Country University Campus, which she continues to chair. I'd also like to acknowledge the many personal sacrifices she made so willingly, whilst in the role, for the good of her community. These certainly did not go unnoticed. Liz, you are shining example of what regional community spirit is about. Congratulations.
