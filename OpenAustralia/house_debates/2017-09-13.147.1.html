       <p>
        Tonight I want to recognise the great work of the Queensland Country Women's Association in the Ipswich and West Moreton region. It was a pleasure to be able to attend the annual general meeting of the West Moreton division of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">
         CWA
        </a>
        hosted at the Silkstone-Booval branch hall. The West Moreton division comprises branches in Boonah, Esk, Glenore Grove,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorgan_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Glamorgan Vale
        </a>
        , Harrisville, Ipswich, Lowood, Rosewood and Walloon. Now in its 95th year, the CWA has long served as a helping hand and binding voice within these communities and far beyond. The commitment, selflessness and achievements of the women of the CWA are truly amazing. These humble hardworking members go about their deeds, largely without recognition or accolade. It's a great pleasure to be able to spend time with them each year and hear their stories about how the CWA has changed their lives—that is, to empower them to assist others.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank West Moreton division president, Annette Pickering, for welcoming me to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
         AGM
        </a>
        and for her ongoing work. I wish to acknowledge the numerous branch and division office holders and members who were in attendance, many of whom have been long-term servants giving their all in the service of others. I want to make particular mention of Helen Johnston, who this week concludes her role of 12 years, no less, as the division secretary for the West Moreton division of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCWA" rel="nofollow">
         QCWA
        </a>
        . It is an outstanding achievement, and one clearly appreciated by all in attendance, judging by the affection and well wishes she received. I can say that all the women, without exception, were so generous with their time in sharing their stories with me over a cuppa and a piece of cake. Every year I go and say, half in jest, that I only go for the food—there is a bit of truth in that. Their cooking classes, community meal assistances and the countless efforts they make in craft and arts programs for members and others throughout their branches in my electorate are a testimony to their enduring ability to unite, empower and connect people.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is, however, so much more to the activities of the CWA. A quick chat with any member of their branch will reveal the scope and reach of their activities. For example, the local CWA, in partnership with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_International" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary International
        </a>
        , provides birthing kits to women in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Islands
        </a>
        . These birthing kits are put together by branch members, prepared for shipping by the state office and then sent with the assistance of Rotary via a shipping container. Members have told me these kits, which contain vital supplies for the safety and hygiene of birthing, regularly make their ways to remote and isolated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        . Make no mistake, these kits save lives by providing basic materials that otherwise would not be available for impoverished women and babies. Likewise, Kits for Kids utilises the same partnership with Rotary International, providing essential classroom materials like pencils, books and other stationery to kids in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        , Fiji and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Solomon Islands
        </a>
        . Both of these projects strike at the heart of poverty and disadvantage in our region—access to basic health care and education. Back home in Ipswich and West Moreton, emergency kits are a fabulous idea which operates in conjunction with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich Hospital
        </a>
        , providing simple kits to assist people who find themselves in need of emergency care, without basic toiletries and other simple, yet necessary, supplies.
       </p>
       <p>
        In partnership with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVC" rel="nofollow">
         DVC
        </a>
        onnect, the local CWA branches also provide the preparation and supply of care packs for victims fleeing domestic violence. These packs contain basic items for the period immediately following a victim's unforeseen and traumatic escape from violence. It's deeply disturbing for many of these women and far too common that they and their children escape with only the clothes they're wearing. The West Moreton division also operates a low-cost independent living centre in Ipswich for women, a girls' hostel and many other assets. They manage to ensure the great work they do continues. There is really strong and sound financial management, another testimony to the great skill and care that they bring to the organisation. It speaks volumes for their willingness, resourcefulness and the support they inspire in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm sure there are many community organisations that could take a leaf out of the impressive yet unheralded way in which the members of the local CWA go about their task in supporting others. I thank them for the charitable support they give. I would encourage more people to join the CWA. I thank the local branch members and the wonderful women for the work they do.
