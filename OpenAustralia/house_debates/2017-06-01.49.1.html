        I think the member for

        for his speech recognising the Coptics. I rise today to continue, along with my good friend the member for Canning, to update the House on an infrastructure project, which is the Forrestfield-

        in my electorate. I am pleased to say that the construction of the first of the three new stations in my electorate has started with the Airport Central Station. The Forrestfield-Airport Link will connect the suburbs of Belmont, Redcliffe, Perth airport and

        to the CBD. This is the biggest expansion of Perth's rail systems since the Mandurah rail line was completed, and, unfortunately for the member for Grayndler, it was the coalition government and the former state Liberal government that took charge to make this rail project a reality—but I am sure he might claim it.
       </p>
       <p>
        This piece of infrastructure means a 20-minute trip to the heart of the CBD, instead of what is otherwise a 40-minute drive. It is welcomed emphatically by my constituents. The construction of this rail infrastructure project is expected to create 2,000 jobs during the construction phase of the entire project—just what the WA economy needs as we transition from the investment phase of the mining boom. As we all know on this side of the House, it is job creation that drives our economic growth. This is just another example of how this government, rather than playing games and trying to score cheap political points, is delivering real and lasting outcomes for everyday Australians and my electorate of Swan.
