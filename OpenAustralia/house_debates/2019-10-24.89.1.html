        government's stable and certain budget management enables critical investment in regional Australia, including in telecommunications? And is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I'd like to thank the member for Mallee for her question. I acknowledge her strong advocacy on behalf of her constituents in relation to the delivery of critical investment and services in her electorate of Mallee. In this context, I'm pleased to advise the House a new mobile base station at Nullawil in the member's electorate has recently been switched on under the government's Mobile Black Spot Program The Mobile Black Spot Program is an excellent example of the record levels of investment we are making in regional Australia and a reflection of the improvements in services we are providing because of the strong, stable budget environment delivered by this government. A strong budget management, which has delivered a record of 36 consecutive months of jobs growth, underpins the investments that we are making in regional services through the government's $220 million Stronger Regional Digital Connectivity Package. Through this package, the government is proud to be delivering improved mobile coverage and digital connectivity for more regional communities. The package includes $160 million for round 5 and round 6 of the highly successful Mobile Black Spot Program, taking the overall investment in this program to $380 million, with social benefit to the regional communities, including emergency service facilities, schools and tourist sites.
        </p>
        <p>
         Through this program, people living, working and travelling in the Nullawil area, in the member for Mallee's electorate, can now experience the real social, economic and safety benefits of improved mobile coverage that these new mobile base stations provide. The Nullawil base station will provide up to 100 square kilometres of new and improved 3G and 4G mobile coverage to the Nullawil township and surrounding area, including over 20 kilometres of road coverage along the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Highway" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and adjoining roads, which obviously the member for Mallee would be very pleased about.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our side of the House also recognises that regional communities are diverse and have different telecommunications needs. For this reason, the Stronger Regional Digital Connectivity Package also includes $60 million for the new Regional Connectivity Program. This program will provide improved access to digital technologies for Australians living in regional and remote areas. This means people will be better connected and will have access to services like telehealth. I know the member for Mallee is very passionate about the possibility of telehealth. We are working closely with local communities, industries and all levels of government to ensure the best possible design of the program. I know the member for Mallee understands what the government's investments in infrastructure and services mean for the people of her electorate. Whether it is addressing mobile back spots, funding key road corridors through Roads of Strategic Importance or delivering more rural medical training places for the Murray Darling Medical School, these initiatives certainly improve the capabilities of so many people living in regional Australia.
