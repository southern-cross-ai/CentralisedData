        My question is to the Minister for the Environment, representing the Minister for Women. Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison government is supporting victims-survivors of domestic and family violence, including through the new 'escaping violence' payment?

         I thank the member for Robertson for her question and commend her on all the incredible work she does in her electorate, especially during the pandemic. Keeping women and children safe is at the heart of the Morrison government's women's policy agenda—safer in the community, safer online, safer at home. In this year's budget, we announced $1.1 billion to dedicate to women's safety. That's just a down payment on the next national action plan. I say it's a down payment, in spite of the fact that this was the most significant amount, because there's always more work to be done to rise to the challenge of keeping women and families from all walks of life safe and to ensure that every person has the opportunity to live life free of violence, coercion and abuse in all their pernicious forms. Anyone escaping violence, no matter their prior circumstances, faces real anxiety and real challenges—accommodation, schooling, how you're going to pay the bills. There are genuine fears for your personal safety. These are some of the critical areas where help is required, and that's why part of our investment in women's safety is a new $144.8 million escaping violence payment—the first of its kind.
        </p>
        <p>
         As of tomorrow, 19 October, the escaping violence payment will be available to any person escaping domestic, family and sexual violence. Through our service partners, UnitingCare, the payment, which is worth up to $5,000, will be provided as both cash and direct payments for goods and services, ensuring the financial security of individuals and families as they escape violence and re-establish their lives with appropriate wrap-up support services. The payments are not taxable or reportable, and they help with essential needs, such as bond payments for accommodation, school fees and uniforms, furniture and appliances—the things that people need for safety and stability as they navigate their path away from violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         While this payment is a critical new initiative, it is only part of this government's response to family and domestic violence, as we work towards the final stages of consultation on the next national action plan to prevent violence against women and their children. Frontline workers, our state and territory partners and non-government organisations are continuing to deliver life-saving circumstances. The safety of women and children in our communities, workplaces and homes is everyone's business, and I know this government and this House are resolute in continuing the work we must do to protect families, women and children in all corners of the country.
