         Last Thursday
        </a>
        the Cowan community said a sad goodbye to Marangaroo resident and local legend Lara Radmila Mittic, who, sadly, passed away suddenly on 2 April. I want to send my condolences to her son, Bobby; daughter, Sarah; granddaughter, Tiana; great-granddaughter, Zarneya; and her extended family in Australia and Serbia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lara was born in 1950 in Serbia and migrated to Australia as a young woman with her husband. At a very young age she packed her bags, her $33 in savings and her young son, Bobby, and left her dysfunctional marriage. Her daughter, Sarah, was born, and Lara became a single working mother of two, with Bobby having some fairly complex health needs. Despite all that, she managed to buy her own home and settle in Marangaroo.
       </p>
       <p>
        By any means, Lara did not have an easy life. Unfortunately, some chronic health issues meant that she had to leave the job that she loved, in patient care. But, despite her own struggles, Lara always had a helping hand to lend to her community. She became widely known and admired for her acerbic wit, her fierce advocacy for her community and the fact that she was not afraid to speak her mindâ€”and would give you a serve if you needed a serve, often using some pretty colourful language! She was also an avid gardener. She loved gardening. My own home is host to many of Lara's plants that she very graciously donated to us when we moved into our new home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night, during the Treasurer's budget speech, I couldn't help but think of Lara. I couldn't help but think of the measures that were introduced in last night's budget and how they would help someone like Lara. The measures to help single mothers would have helped Lara, as a single mother. The measures around

        visits, cheaper medicines and strengthening Medicare would have helped Lara, as someone with chronic and ongoing health issues. And our fierce protection of the

         NDIS
        </a>
        , embedded in the budget last night, would have helped Lara, as the mother of a child with complex needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lara was an avid and a very loyal Labor supporter. Despite her own illnesses, she showed up at every election campaign for me and for the local member. She loved Labor, and we loved her back. Rest in peace, Lara. I know you are smiling down on us from heaven.
