        Mr Speaker, I thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question of the Minister for

        <p>
         I thank the member for Lyons for his question. He, like all Tasmanian members in this House, has been working to ensure that the Tasmanian economy does diversify and does it in a sustainable way. The truth is that the Tasmanian economy, like all of Australia, is an economy in transition, but the Tasmanian economy has a hugely strong future, and members on this side of the House know it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Think of the comparative advantages that Tasmania has: clean air, clean energy, clean water, sustainable industries. Given that they, like so many other parts of the economy, are being impacted by a high dollar that takes competitiveness away, we need to find ways in which to make those industries and those comparative advantages more competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are in the circumstance of the greatest economic transformation the world has known. It is not just coming from China; it is coming from Asia; it is coming from India. Those on the other side want to stick their heads in the sand and do not think they need to play a role in it. We do.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister and the Premier of Tasmania signed a partnership agreement. I have been to Tasmania more than half-a-dozen times since that framework was put in place to talk about the detail. Forestry is an important part of this equation. We have the opportunity for the first time, through that agreement, to move to a forest products industry based on a sustainable resource. If we are able to move to a sustainable resource, why wouldn't we want to value-add to it? And that is what we want to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         The trouble is that we have people down there seeking to run the industry down, while those who are in the Liberal Party in Tasmania sit silent. I say that when you enter an agreement you have to honour it. The agreement that was entered was to ensure that there would be wood supply—and that is what we say the Greens and all of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
          NGO
         </a>
         s need to do. I say, and we know, that if this agreement falls over there will be no increase in reserves, no social licence and no ballast to underpin the industry. But listen—

           If the circumstances are that the Greens want to oppose this, there is the opportunity for the Liberal Party to get behind this forward-looking agenda, not stick their head in the sand, as
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
            Tony Abbott
           </a>
           does, and say, 'In the opposition we can't fix things, so don't even get bogged down with them.' That is the opposition approach here. It should not be the opposition's approach in Tasmania.

                 I can, and they relate to two important opportunities for the Tasmanian economy. One is the dairy industry and one is the aquaculture industry, which the honourable member knows lots about. In the north-west of Tasmania we see the potential to grow extensively the dairy industry, but, unless they get the skills base and unless they get the infrastructure of electricity and power, that will not be able to expand. That is why, last weekend, we ensured that we invested in the training base and connecting the electricity to important parts of the economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The mention of water is rightly made because one of the great comparative advantages that Tasmania has is water and a surplus of it. The question is: how do we harness it? That is why the discussions that we have been having also go to the question of how we can expand the irrigation industry so that the water is not lost. That is going to advance the aquaculture industry down in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huon_Valley" rel="nofollow">
                  Huon Valley
                 </a>
                 . It is going to expand the dairy industry, the grazing industry, the horticulture industry and the viticulture industry. This is what we have been able to do because this government committed resources to the diversification of the Tasmanian economy. Not only have we sat down and tried to give effect to the agreement reached; we want to help industries and jobs and workers—and we will do it. The opposition should get on board—
