        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. Yesterday the minister claimed there would be no purchase price impact, despite the Federal Chamber of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Industries" rel="nofollow">
         Automotive Industries
        </a>
        estimate that Labor's new family car and ute tax could cost $38 billion in penalties over five years, based on 2023 sales, and these would be paid for by Australians. Why is the minister refusing to be upfront with the Australian people about the impact of this new tax?

          The reason I appreciate the question from the honourable gentleman so much is that it enables me to correct several of the myths and misinformation that the opposition is peddling in relation to this policy, including the one that the honourable member just perpetuated.
         </p>
         <p>
          In relation to the FCAI's figures, the FCAI themselves have said, since releasing that figure, that it was 'a very simple analysis', and they went on to say, 'We're not saying that sales from 2023 will be replicated. We're just saying that, if it was replicated, this is what the cost would be.'

              <p>
               And just in the last half an hour we've seen evidence of that, with the announcement by Toyota that they are about to start importing their first-ever electric vehicle into Australia, which we very much welcome, which indicates very much that this extra choice for Australian people is something that can be delivered.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's not just us who believe this. The member for Gippsland might want to have a little word in the shell-like ear of our old friend the member for Bradfield, who has dealt with these sorts of scare campaigns in the past and, I must say, very eloquently and very commendably and very efficiently—knocked all the scare campaigns away in his very eloquent op-ed in the
               <i>
                Australian
               </i>
               , which is still on his website as we speak, today. It's still up on his website this afternoon, where he said, 'The evidence from overseas is that there will be no increase in prices for any car.' And he was right. My new year's resolution was to be kinder and fairer to the opposition. I'm going to start with the member for Bradfield by quoting him approvingly on a regular basis because he deserves nothing less! He made the case.
              </p>
              <p>
               In relation to others, again I draw the attention of the member for Gippsland to Hyundai, Volkswagen,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW" rel="nofollow">
                BMW
               </a>
               , Kia and Volvo, who have all welcomed the government's new vehicle efficiency standard—all of them. And motoring organisations—the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRMA" rel="nofollow">
                NRMA
               </a>
               , the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RACQ" rel="nofollow">
                RACQ
               </a>
               and the

                RACWA
               </a>
               , for example, who called for us to do exactly what we have done.
              </p>
              <p>
               The real question for the opposition is: why do they want to stand in the way of better choices and better savings for motorists right across Australia. Why does the member for Gippsland, whose average constituent drives 17,830 kilometres a year, not want that constituent to receive $1,417 worth of fuel savings if they buy a new car in 2028. Why is the opposition so against better choices for Australians? Why are they against—
