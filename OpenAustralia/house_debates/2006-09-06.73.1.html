        , Territories and Roads. Would the minister update the House on the status of the Perth to Bunbury highway project? Has the

         I thank the member for Canning for his question and for his outstanding efforts in ensuring the constituency in his electorate receive the benefit of this project. In fact, all the government members from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         have supported the start of this very important project. The Australian government is firmly committed to the Perth to Bunbury project and had $150 million on the table for this project. The Prime Minister in fact announced an additional $20 million to ensure that this project started in 2006. It disturbs me greatly, and I know it disturbs the member for Canning, to read in the

         newspaper yesterday that the

         planning minister,

         , said, when asked about a 2006 start, that she agreed it was only possible; not definite. The Australian government and the constituents in Western Australia want to know more than a possible start; they want a definite start on this project.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whilst the government members from Western Australia have been very vocal about this project, the member for Brand and Leader of the Opposition has been very quiet in his support for getting this project started. The Australian government wants this project started in 2006, and if the member for Brand wants to assist his constituents he ought to pick up the phone, ring Alannah MacTiernan and his Labor mates in Western Australia and say, ‘Let’s get on with this project; let’s get on with building the Perth to Bunbury highway; let’s get on with saving lives on Western Australian roads.’
