        </a>
        at Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Rockhampton airports.
       </p>
       <p>
        Airservices Australia proposes to undertake a continuous improvement program to replace or refurbish the Airservices Australia air traffic control tower inventory, at an estimated out-turn cost for stage 1 of the National Towers Program of $94.5 million plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Airservices Australia operates 26 air traffic control towers throughout Australia. As the age of towers increases, the ability to cost-effectively maintain the facilities and to maintain and upgrade equipment certainly diminishes. The control towers range in age from 10 years to around 50 years, with an average age in excess of 30 years. The objective of stage 1 of the National Towers Program is to replace the existing control towers at Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Rockhampton airports.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that the proposed work proceed, subject to the recommendations of the committee. Airservices Australia accepts and will implement these recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, it is anticipated that a design and construct contractor will be appointed by the end of this year, with construction completed some 20 months later. This will, of course, be subject to the responses received when the market is approached.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend this motion to the House.

             <p>
              Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was saying it is a great day for Townsville, with
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
               Lavarack Barracks
              </a>
              being progressively updated over the three redevelopment stages. These works that are being referred to the parliament for consideration today represent stage 4 of that redevelopment, at an estimated out-turn cost of $207.2 million.
             </p>
             <p>
              The principal objective of this proposal is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the infrastructure in support of defence capability, reduce facilities maintenance expenditure on buildings and infrastructure, and address functional and occupational health and safety deficiencies within the existing facilities. What that group of official words actually mean is that the equipment and infrastructure of 4 Field Regiment, 3CER and 3rd/4th
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR" rel="nofollow">
               CR
              </a>
              really need attention, and that will be addressed under this redevelopment.
             </p>
             <p>
              These facilities which are being refurbished or replaced were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s to support the training for deployment to Vietnam. These facilities are certainly now substandard and no longer provide the functionality for a modern army.
             </p>
             <p>
              In its report, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
               Public Works
              </a>
              Committee recommended that these works do proceed, subject to recommendations of the committee. I am pleased to say that the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
               Department of Defence

              accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction could commence later this year, with completion in mid-2011. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support and I commend this motion to the House.
             </p>

              That, in accordance with the provisions of the

               Public Works Committee Act 1969

              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_Barracks" rel="nofollow">

              , Watsonia, Victoria.
             </p>
             <p>
              Being the even-handed person that I am, this is one for the Victorians. This is a $101.3 million proposal for the redevelopment of the Defence Force School of Signals at Simpson Barracks. The object of the proposal is to address current facility shortfalls required to deliver communications and information systems training to defence personnel. The proposed facilities and infrastructure works involve a mixture of new facilities and adaptation and refurbishment of existing facilities.
             </p>
             <p>
              In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. I am pleased to say that the Department of Defence accepts and will implement all of those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction could commence in early 2008 with completion by late 2009. On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support. I commend this motion to the House.
