         Thomas Jefferson
        </a>
        , a founding father of the United States and its third president, who said that 'education is the defence of the nation'. Nowhere do we see this more graphically than in my electorate of Kooyong, for Kooyong is an educational metropolis. There are over 35,000 school students in the electorate and over 50 schools. It has a very strong government school sector, Catholic school sector and independent school sector, with co-ed schools and single-sex schools, secondary schools and primary schools.

        I find it one of the most rewarding aspects of my role in the parliament to visit my local schools and spend time with teachers and students. More recently I visited Kew East Primary School where I addressed a whole school assembly and celebrated

        I chatted with year 10 students who undertook research at the

         Camberwell High School

        These schools are all a hub of activity, but today it is my great pleasure to congratulate the winners of the

        who live in my electorate. The Australian Student Prize is a national prize awarded to senior secondary students for academic excellence in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and informatics. It was first awarded in 1991 and it is a $1 million government program where there are 500 recipients. Prize winners receive a cheque for $2,000. There are 11 winners from 10 schools who live in my electorate: Miranda Gaze and Isabelle Xavier from

        I congratulate each of these students for their commitment to their studies and for this incredible achievement. I also congratulate their parents and their teachers for giving them support and encouraging academic excellence. It is a worthy prize for a worthy achievement and I congratulate all those involved.
