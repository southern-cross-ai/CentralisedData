        and other legislation amendment Bill 2024 will strengthen the legislative framework for the screening and inspection of domestic and international mail to ensure that they are fit for purpose for the modern age. It does this through a number of measures. First, the bill ensures that

        and border agencies can more efficiently share information with other Commonwealth, state and territory agencies and authorities under strict parameters to assist in the performance of their functions and duties during investigative and regulatory activities. Second, the bill makes technical amendments to clarify the officers and officials of agencies and authorities are permitted to open and examine postal articles where it is authorised under the act and any other laws, and where it is necessary to perform their functions or duties to ensure the safety and security of Australians. Third, new ministerial powers would be inserted to future-proof the system against emerging risks, allowing Australia Post and border agencies to adapt their practices as required. These powers would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Fourth, the bill make amendments to better deal with the forfeiture, disposal and destruction of postal articles containing explosive, dangerous and injurious things, and to protect the safety of postal workers and customers and biosecurity officers. Finally, the bill makes some minor amendments to simplify existing terminology and legislative process, as well as update existing references to state and territory legislation, giving greater certainty to Australia Post employees, and customs and biosecurity officers, when exercising the legislative powers and functions for mail screening.

        Importantly, these measures have been designed with appropriate privacy safeguards and will be subject to existing strict parameters and reporting obligations in the act. There has also been extensive consultation with Australia Post and relevant agencies throughout the development of the draft bill since 2018. They have confirmed that there is an operational need to modernise the legislation. This legislation will contribute to immediate enhancements to Australia's border protection, biosecurity and national security. I commend the bill to the House.
