        I rise today to acknowledge the recent aftermath of Cyclone Jasper, a natural disaster that struck with ferocity unmatched in recent memory. This unprecedented event was tracked from its inception as a tropical low system, commanding headlines and drawing national media attention to our shores. Journalists were speculating on outcomes, painting pictures of cyclonic Armageddon, while the reality on the ground told a very different story. While the cyclone itself didn't cause any structural damage, it was the rain that quickly followed afterwards that was the real challenge. Media outlets prematurely declared that the worst was over. A front page from the

        </i>
        declared the worst was over and that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North" rel="nofollow">
         Far North
        </a>
        was 'out of harm's way as Cyclone Jasper crosses the coast'. This was so misleading. What followed was a rain bomb of unimaginable proportions, causing devastation across Cairns and beyond. Communities at

        and further north of the Daintree in Wujal, Bargara and others suffered significant flooding. Many places were isolated, and are still isolated, by total inundation. In the wake of the disaster, it became evident that technology cannot replace local knowledge. My concerns regarding the Bureau of Meteorology's centralisation have been confirmed. The lack of ground presence in regions like

        </a>
        has had dire consequences for accurate forecasting. As we move forward, I will continue to advocate for the diversification of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOM" rel="nofollow">

        's workforce back into our regional communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The resilience of our people has been tested, but our spirits remain unbroken. Heroes emerged from the tragedy: individuals like Dan Cairns, Alec Dunn and helicopter pilot Magoo, who all risked their lives to save others. The community hubs of Machans Beach and Holloways Beach have been beacons of hope. Volunteers like Mary, Wendy, Jade, Michelle, Pauline, Pat, Renee, Rennae and Stephanie have given so much back to the struggling communities. However our recovery is hindered by insurance challenges. The application of the 48-hour rule by insurance companies separating cyclone damage from subsequent flooding is an injustice that must be immediately addressed. It is imperative that we align our international standards, extending the period to 168 hours to ensure the comprehensive cover of our affected communities. Insurance companies are doing their absolute best to avoid their responsibility to their clients. It is a disgrace that is actively underway in Far North Queensland.

        I'd commend the Queensland Reconstruction Authority

        Jake Ellwood and Deputy State Recovery Coordinator Mike Wassing for their response. Their forthcoming recommendations will be crucial in preparing for future events. We must learn and adapt, and ensure the protection and resilience of our communities against the inevitable challenges ahead.
