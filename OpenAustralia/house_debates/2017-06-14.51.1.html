        I rise to pay tribute to three outstanding individuals in my electorate of Robertson on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        who over the long weekend received Order of Australia honours. Ian Robilliard, or Moose, from Terrigal received a

        </a>
        honour for his service to sport. Ian played with the Australian Olympic basketball squad. He has had a successful coaching career and he remains a strong advocate for sport in our region. In addition to playing and coaching, Ian is a board member of Gosford City Basketball and is the founder and director of the Central Coast Academy of Sport.

        , also from Terrigal, has been acknowledged for his services to surf lifesaving. Since 1962, Peter has dedicated his life to keeping the beautiful beaches of the Central Coast safe for residents and visitors alike. Peter continues to dedicate himself to our community and is currently the director of Central Coast Surf Life Saving and is an active member of the Wamberal Surf Life Saving Club. Another outstanding local resident, Dr Brian Shaw of Erina, was recognised for his dedication and service to palliative care. Dr Shaw has worked as a specialist anaesthetist at
