        Community Centre in my electorate on their 25th anniversary, which was held last week. The West Winds Community Centre is at Woodbridge in the channel in my electorate. The original property of West Winds was a dairy farm that the government purchased in the 1960s and used as a home for disadvantaged young boys. It then went on to become the Woodbridge Area School. The home was closed for the boys, and the people from the area formed a local committee to investigate possible uses for this property. It was officially opened in 1990 as the community centre.

        There is a lot of great work that happens at this community centre in Woodbridge, from health and wellbeing programs to social programs, such as Eating With Friends, and exercises. They have a channel challenge happening in the region later this month, on 29 March. This centre has a wonderful and active committee. They are very active in their local community.

        was there with them last week celebrating their 25th anniversary. It is a great local community centre, and I want to congratulate the committee and all the local community members who volunteer in the Woodbridge West Winds Community Centre day in, day out. It is a wonderful committee doing great work in their local community. Twenty-five years is a great milestone for a community house.
