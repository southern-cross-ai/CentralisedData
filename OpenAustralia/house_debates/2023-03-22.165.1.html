       <p>
        As has been spoken about a number of times in this place over recent weeks, we are well aware the sad fact is that 21 per cent of households across Australia are experiencing some form of food insecurity. I've seen firsthand families in the Logan community struggling with the rising cost of living, and, as we've seen in recent days, that's only going to get worse. Sadly, for the families to try and make ends meet and pay the bills, people have had to skip meals, to go without food for days.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm sure everyone would agree that this is simply unacceptable and something needs to change and change fast. Across our electorates, we have many terrific and wonderful community organisations that seek to help people in need out. One amongst many of those great community organisations in my electorate is the Loganlea Community Centre, and I had the pleasure of catching up with them last week. Usually the community pantry is full to the brim with non-perishable goods that those in the community who are doing it tough can access, but, sadly, those pantry shelves look rather bare at the moment because of the needs of the community. I was pleased to be able to present them with a few boxes of goods to restock their shelves in a little way. President Karen Hook and her team, just like many other charity groups in Logan, are struggling simply to keep up.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the need for non-perishable items, there's also a growing need for fresh fruit and vegetables. Just like many families, these community groups are struggling to keep up with the increasing cost of getting those goods into their pantries in the first place. But there is some good news for our community, in that Loganlea State High School has been working quietly over the last couple of years with the Mini Farm Project to set up a mini farm at the school. The beauty of this mini farm project is that the food the students are growing will be donated directly back to local charities, such as the Loganlea Community Centre, to provide fresh food to those who are vulnerable and need to continue to access good quality food at affordable prices. The mini farm project is currently producing fresh beetroot, lettuce, carrots and turnips, and during the cooler months the students plan to grow broccoli, cauliflowerâ€”and maybe even some kale for those who are so inclined.
       </p>
       <p>
        To principal Brenton Farleigh and the whole team at Loganlea State High School, I say thank you for your efforts with the mini farm. We look forward to your continued success. Also, thank you to the Loganlea Community Centre for your great work.
