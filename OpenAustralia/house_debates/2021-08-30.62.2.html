        The Leader of the Opposition and I discussed this earlier today. All on this side of the House and, I'm sure, all across the whole House and in the other chamber, which is adjourning, are deeply saddened by the very sad news of the passing of Senator Alex Gallacher. Senator Gallacher served in this parliament for 10 years. Born in Scotland, his father headed out here, in Senator Gallacher's own words, for 'a better chance for himself and his family'. That's what this country is all about. That's the country he served.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know members will want to gather their thoughts and to pay a complete tribute to Senator Gallacher in the next few days and for there to be all condolences and honours due to a serving member of the parliament. We will indeed do that. We will honour this servant of Australia—a man who loved his adopted country, who loved the party he served and was faithful to it and who found purpose in serving others in our parliament. To all in the Labor movement and the caucus, to the Leader of the Opposition and particularly to those from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        : we extend our deepest sympathies to all of you. To Senator Gallacher's family: we send our love and prayers to you on this terrible day. May God bless him. May God bless all of you. And may our colleague and friend rest in peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion will be moved tomorrow which will provide the opportunity for members to speak to that motion. Here today we simply acknowledge him and thank him for his wonderful service. We remember him and what he's done for our country and we think of his family most of all.

         I thank the Prime Minister for his warm words and for his message of condolence. It is, indeed, sad news—the passing of a sitting senator, Senator Alex Gallacher. Alex represented
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         in the Senate since 2010. He was born in Scotland on the first day of 1954 and came to Australia 12 years later with his parents, like so many migrants, to seek a better life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alex dedicated his life to the interests of working people both as a trade unionist and as a senator. He came to this parliament with 17 years of experience of hard, physical work as a labourer and a truck driver as well as a ramp services operator at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_Australia_Airlines" rel="nofollow">
          Trans Australia Airlines
         </a>
         . He joined Labor in Darwin in 1988, when he also began to work for his beloved
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Transport Workers Union
         </a>
         , where he became the secretary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">

          Northern Territory
         </a>
         branch.
        </p>
        <p>
         In his first speech in the Senate, he named his priorities as the transport sector, superannuation and road safety. In that speech we saw a glimpse of Alex's humility, as he spoke of his love for the transport sector and the people who worked in it. He said this:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There is no smoke and mirrors, just plain-talking, hardworking employees and employers alike in a tough, competitive industry which works harder than most people imagine and continues to work while most people are asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alex's career was, indeed, a fine one. We in Labor are very proud of Alex. He was a conscientious, no-nonsense man who knew what he stood for. Along with his mate 'Sterlie', he was a long-time member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport committee. He particularly prioritised road safety for those people in the transport sector who keep our country going and who during COVID have continued to keep our country going.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alex was also a family man who was dedicated to his wife, Paola, and also to his children and grandchildren. In that first speech, he quoted
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

         President Theodore Roosevelt, who said:

        <p class="italic">
         Far and away the best prize life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alex did that. He did that as a working man, as a truck driver in the transport sector, as a transport union official and then as a senator.

         , for which he was a dedicated member and which he loved and truly served completely every day, we express our condolences to his family and to his friends. May he rest in peace. We will have an opportunity to more formally honour Senator Gallacher tomorrow.
