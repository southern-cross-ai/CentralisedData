It's one of Can Assist West Wyalong's biggest fundraising events, with a total of 943 walkers, 391 kilometres walked and $310,000 raised. Well done, Greg. In Coolamon shire, Paul Horan leads the way.

She's a dedicated youth worker at the Cowra Information and Neighbourhood Centre. She helps youths get their lives back on track.

I know Glen well. He's done so much with the Grenfell RSL sub-branch. He became its president in 2017, a position he still holds. Young Citizen of the Year was Christine Burnett, and she plays a major role in showcasing the region's vibrant art and cultural communities as president of Hilltop Arts. I say to each and every one of them: thank you.
