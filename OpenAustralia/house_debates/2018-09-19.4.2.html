       <p>
        It's important that Australia's aviation security framework remains effective and fit for purpose in an evolving and increasingly complex security environment. The Aviation Transport Security Amendment Bill 2018 will ensure that Australia's aviation security framework remains responsive to changes in the security environment, while reducing the regulatory burden on smaller aviation industry participants.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aviation is an enduring and attractive target for terrorists. This was evidenced in July 2017 by the disrupted attack in Sydney. The attack marked a significant shift in the threat and risk to aviation in Australia, and it demonstrated a level of sophistication not seen before in our country. To remain ahead of the evolving threat, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        is working with industry to introduce a range of new security measures, including sophisticated new technology, screening devices at major and regional airports and enhanced powers for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is vital, however, to balance aviation security needs with maintaining a viable aviation sector, particularly in regional Australia. Not all industry participants face the same level of risk. The department uses intelligence and characteristics specific to each aviation operator to assess that risk. This shows, not unexpectedly, that larger aircraft and major airports are more attractive targets.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will introduce measures to allow the Secretary of Home Affairs, or their delegate, to give a model transport security program, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSP" rel="nofollow">
         TSP
        </a>
        , to a lower risk aviation operator. An industry participant is required under the act to have a TSP, and it sets out the measures and procedures that they have in place to meet their regulatory obligation. The Department of Home Affairs assesses all TSPs, including minor amendments, and undertakes rigorous compliance activities to ensure industry participants meet their regulatory obligations and to maintain security.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, the act requires all industry participants to maintain a comprehensive and bespoke TSP. This is despite the differences in the risk, size, sophistication or complexity of their operations. This approach places a disproportionately high administrative burden on some lower-risk industry participants, such as smaller regional airports. In practice, an industry participant would be given a secretary-issued TSP if assessed as lower risk and where the administrative burden of preparing a bespoke TSP is not proportionate to the security outcomes. The secretary-issued TSP will enable lower-risk industry participants to direct resources to maintaining security measures rather than towards preparing documents for government. If an industry participant's risk profile changes—for example, they start operating larger aircraft or experience a significant increase in passenger numbers—the department will reassess their risk profile and adjust their security requirements accordingly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Measures provided for in this bill will uphold security outcomes while ensuring security measures and costs are commensurate with risk. I commend the bill to the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
