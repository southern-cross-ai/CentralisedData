        It was fantastic to be part of the official opening recently of the women's changing rooms and facility upgrades at James Browne Oval at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woy_Woy" rel="nofollow">
         Woy Woy
        </a>
        . These improvements are, in part, thanks to a contribution of more than $480,000 by the Morrison government, and they include new changing rooms for female players, a redeveloped canteen and upgrades to the clubhouse. Additional contributions from organisations, including the Ettalong Diggers and Raybal Constructions, also helped ensure these improvements became a reality.
       </p>

        James Browne Oval is a hub for many sporting clubs on the peninsula, including the Southern &amp; Ettalong United Football Club, which has over 700 members. The club president, Glen Balneaves, said that the investment will help to boost morale among players and assist with the future growth and development of the women's, youth and senior programs. The women at the club also told me how important the new change rooms were in providing a private space for their teams to gather before a game, as well as equal standing with the men at the club.

        Sporting facilities like James Browne Oval are so much more than spaces to be active; they create a pride of place and a sense of belonging for players and spectators alike. That's why the Morrison government is committed to delivering improved infrastructure to assist in building stronger, more vibrant local communities. This funding is in addition to the $120,000 federal government investment to help improve and upgrade irrigation and drainage facilities at the oval. I congratulate the football club for their work in applying for this grant, and a special thankyou to Kylie Brown for her tireless effort in support of the peninsula sporting community.
