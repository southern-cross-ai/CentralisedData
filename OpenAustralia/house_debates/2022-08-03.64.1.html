         The deputy leader will resume her seat. I think I know where the Leader of the House is going. To assist the House and to assist the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would ask her to rephrase the end part of the question. You can repeat the question as long as it does not reflect upon the Prime Minister. I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

           I thank the deputy leader for her question, which goes to what has occurred over the last four months. There is one date in particular that sticks in my mind over the last four months and it is 21 May 2022. On 21 May 2022, 77 members of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           were elected to the House of Representatives. Those 77 people were elected with a very clear mandate: to end the waste and the rorts that dominated those opposite, to end the corruption that occurred by establishing a national anticorruption commission, to make sure that we had fairness in the workplace by reforming industrial relations, to give the lowest-paid workers on $20.33 an hour a $1-an-hour increase, something that those opposite said would ruin the economy. We were elected with a mandate for increased investment in public housing, through our housing Australia future fund.

              The member will resume her seat. That is the second time in a row she has done that. I warned her specifically yesterday about taking points of order during question time to disrupt questions. I want to be very clear on this. She is right down to the wire in terms of pushing me at the moment to ensure we keep question time flowing. I cannot be clearer than that. I call the Prime Minister.

              <p>
               I was asked about the last four months and I am going through the last four months, which, I must say, I have had worse four months. I've got to say that, because in the last four months what we've also done is advance the interests of the Australian people who have wanted action on climate change, with a 43 per cent reduction by 2030 when the legislation will be carried. We have been moving forward the debate about climate change, working with business, working with unions and working with civil society.
              </p>
              <p>
               That's why, as well, we've convened the Jobs and Skills Summit that will occur within four months of that election on 21 May. That's why we also introduced into this parliamentâ€”and will carry through both housesâ€”10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave. That's why already we are taking action to implement the recommendations of the aged-care royal commission. That's why we've already made moves on the robodebt royal commission. This is a government that has taken up the mantle, both before and now, of preparing a solid agenda for a government that is forward looking and for a government that actually governsâ€”as opposed to just engaging in cheap, tawdry politics everyday.
