       <p>
        The last two years have shown my community just how important their health is to them. Almost 3,000 people have contacted my office to express their concern about the state of health care and Medicare in our community, and they all want Medicare protected. They've raised out-of-pocket expenses and the cost and time it takes to get in to see a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        or a specialist, even for children. To ensure that the entire healthcare system works for the people it supports, Medicare must be supported and funded.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding a GP in my area can also be difficult. While most bulk-bill, many have closed their books due to workload or have long waiting times for appointments, sometimes up to two weeks. Primary health care is important in preventing long-term, chronic illnesses that place a further burden on the health dollar and have adverse consequences in my community. I'd like to remind everyone who's missed an appointment with BreastScreen or another type of cancer screening that they should make that appointment now and get their health checked.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to pay tribute to each and every health professional who's supported our community in the last two years. One of our longest-serving general practitioners, Dr Victor Tadros, is retiring next month. He started his practice in 1975 and has looked after generations of people in my communityâ€”and four generations of my family. On behalf of my family and the community of Werriwa, who you've served for so very long, have a happy and wonderful retirement, Dr Tadros.
