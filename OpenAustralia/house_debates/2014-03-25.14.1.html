       <p>
        Two weeks ago, I hosted two very important forums for the Schools Industry Partnership to discuss how the community can help create better pathways for young people transitioning from school to work. One forum was held in Hawkesbury and another in the

         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        . The forums were attended by industry and employment stakeholders from across the region and were the result of discussions I had with

        of Schools Industry Partnership. The Schools Industry Partnership works across the Blue Mountains, Hawkesbury and Nepean. It is a not-for-profit organisation that facilitates partnerships with schools, businesses and the broader community to help young people reach their full potential.

        Ian Palmer has played an integral role in this area for many years, working always with passion and dedication for our young people. The two key questions addressed were: how well prepared are our young people for the world of work; and, how can the community best work together to support and prepare all young people for successful careers post-school. The forums presented an opportunity to facilitate connections with key industry figures and schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all recognise that the workforce has changed substantially over the past 10 to 15 years, and some young people are having difficulty transitioning to work. Both forums were well attended by key stakeholders, including Bart Bassett, the member for Londonderry; Roza Sage, the member for Blue Mountains; Dr Jane Cavanagh of the University of
