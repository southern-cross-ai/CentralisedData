        and Personnel. Will the minister inform the House of the current status of recovering the remains of those Australians who died in the

         If you go over the lake and drive up
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Parade" rel="nofollow">
          Anzac Parade
         </a>
         , you will pass the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Forces_National_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Vietnam Forces National Memorial
         </a>
         . It is a very impressive and imposing memorial indeed, with three large concrete walls. Around the memorial are three seats. These three seats contain the names of six Australian servicemen, who at the time the memorial was established had not come back from Vietnam. Fortunately, owing to the work of Mr Jim Bourke and Operation Aussies Home, and with the support of the previous government and the then minister responsible, the member for Dunkley, finances were made available to allow work to be done and provide a capacity to return three of those soldiers back home: Lance Corporal Richard Parker, Private Peter Gillson and Lance Corporal John Gillespie. Their remains have been returned to this country and they were buried with the honour they properly deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 27 September 1969, Private David Fisher was hanging by a rope from a helicopter during a hot extraction at Nui May Tao, 32 kilometres north, north-east of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nui_Dat" rel="nofollow">
          Nui Dat
         </a>
         . He fell from the rope. Aircraft personnel undertook an immediate search. There was another search by light helicopter, then an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
          SAS
         </a>
         squadron did a search. Later a rifle company searched for three more days and then another rifle company searched for three more days, but they could find nothing. The search was complicated by the fact that the aircrew were unable to identify exactly where he fell.
        </p>
        <p>
         But owing again to the diligence of these people and Mr Bourke, we were able to, after a time, undertake an extensive search. In consultation with the Vietnamese government and Vietnamese veterans, we were able to identify a place where we thought we might find the remains of Private Fisher. On 8 August this year, an Australian investigation team discovered remains that they believed might belong to this man. On 21 August, another investigation team was sent in. That investigation lasted until 28 August. They were able to find further remains and Private Fisher’s identification tags. After extensive forensic work, the Australian authorities and Vietnamese authorities were able to confirm that these were indeed the remains of Private Fisher. We will be repatriating Private Fisher home to this country on 10 October.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 3 November 1970, Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver disappeared without a trace in a Canberra bomber, A84-231, during a bombing mission approximately 65 kilometres south-west of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang" rel="nofollow">
          Da Nang
         </a>
         in Vietnam. Despite four days of extensive air search, their remains have never been recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, from the original six listed on that memorial, by 10 October we will have the remains of four Army personnel returned home with the honour they deserve. We are still hopeful that, over time, we may find the remains of these two missing airmen.
        </p>
        <p>
         On behalf of the government and, I am sure, on behalf of the House, I wish to thank the Vietnamese authorities for the support we receive while we undertake these searches.
