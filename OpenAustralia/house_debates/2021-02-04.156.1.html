         Australia Day
        </a>
        honours list is a chance for us to reflect on the contributions and achievements of some of our local residents. Sport plays a big role in the Brisbane lifestyle. Cricket, in particular, is on every Brisbane resident's mind at this time of year, and the $7 million of funding that our government contributed to build the National Cricket Campus in Brisbane is about building even stronger institutions and traditions in that sport. Last month, I was pleased to see that Brisbane resident Greg Chappell
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBE" rel="nofollow">
         MBE
        </a>
        has been appointed as an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Officer of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his distinguished service to the traditions of cricket. In the corporate world, Dr Sally Pitkin, whom I know well through her work in a major arts organisation, has been awarded as an Officer of the Order of Australia for her service to business, corporate standards and the advancement of women. In academia, Emeritus Professor Kay Saunders was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for her service to tertiary education, as both an academic and an author, as well as for her service to the community. Another Brisbane sporting legend,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Joseph" rel="nofollow">

        , was appointed as a

        </a>
        for his service to sport and rugby league, as well as his work in the fruit and vegetable industry. Brisbane resident
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Barrett" rel="nofollow">
         Donald Barrett
        </a>
        was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia for his service to tertiary education and academics. And Judith Bell was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia for her dedication to the administration of justice and the visual arts.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also inspiring to see the work of Brisbane medical researchers being increasingly highlighted on the world stage. In that spirit, Dr James McGill has been appointed as Member of the Order of Australia for his service to medicine and medical education. We also give thanks to Brian Hollins, John Tyquin and the late Mrs Diana Dick, all of whom are recipients of the Order of Australia medal for their dedication and service to our community. We thank them, because Brisbane is very fortunate to have great charities, groups and people committed to community service and a better society.
       </p>
       <p>
        A big shout-out also goes to Norm Shrubsole for his service to the community through his many years of tireless volunteering and his leadership with the Brisbane Bardon Lions. I'd also like to mention the Vasile brothers, Wesley and Tudor, who get all of us running every year in Brisbane at the walk for the Mental Awareness Foundation. They received the Lord Mayor's Spirit of Brisbane award this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to also extend our congratulations to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Buchanan" rel="nofollow">
         Gordon Buchanan
        </a>
        , who received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        for his contribution to the transport sector in Queensland, and Roberta Embrey, who received the Australian Corrections Medal. On behalf of our entire Brisbane community, congratulations and thank you to all Brisbane recipients as well as all award recipients in the Australia Day honours list.
