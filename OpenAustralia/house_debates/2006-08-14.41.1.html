        My question is to the Attorney-General. In light of the terror plot in the United Kingdom, would the Attorney-General update the House on Australia’s national security arrangements?

         I thank the honourable member for Blair for the question because I know there is a very real interest in what has tragically occurred in the United Kingdom. These terror related investigations of course are a timely reminder to us all that we here in Australia need to remain vigilant. There is no known link from this event to Australia, but our agencies are working closely with the United Kingdom and the United States on terrorism issues generally. Our agencies have recently recommended that Australia’s national counter-terrorism alert remain at medium, which means that a terrorist act could occur in Australia. The words they use are that ‘a terrorist act is feasible’. The government has recently ensured that our law enforcement and security agencies have the legislative tools they need, and one of those was preventive detention. Of particular interest is that the British government is using preventive detention now to limit the ability of suspects to engage in further activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another valuable resource we have in our community is the contributions that are made to the national security hotline. I am sure that we all remember the number 1800 123 400.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">
          The United Kingdom
         </a>
         has a similar hotline and it has proven invaluable there. Our hotline has received more than 80,000 calls, more than half providing information to agencies. Members should encourage their constituents to use that hotline on appropriate occasions.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         has identified around 3,000 calls that warrant further inquiry. The government is properly resourcing agencies to handle those inquiries. ASIO is on track to meet the government endorsed target of 1,860 staff by the year 2010-11. The growth in staffing will continue to boost ASIO’s ability to meet the challenges of the present security environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The potential attacks in the United Kingdom were to be on a key element of infrastructure. This government has undertaken a comprehensive security assessment of all key infrastructure across Australia. A genuine partnership between government and industry has ensured that information sharing is in place to enable industry to make informed decisions on infrastructure security needs. While terrorists might attempt to strike directly at Australia, I can assure the House that the government is working hard to ensure that that does not happen.
