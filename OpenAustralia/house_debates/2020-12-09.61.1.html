       <p>
        One of the great privileges in this role at this time of year is that get to enjoy attending graduation and awards ceremonies at some of our 41 schools around my electorate of Forde. It's always an honour to join the teachers and students who are the foundation of our future on these special occasions.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's been an incredibly difficult year with COVID-19 testing the resilience and patience of our teachers, students and parents alike, all of which makes the achievements of some of our local schools at the Australian Education Awards even more remarkable. These awards are the country's highest education awards and it's my great pleasure to report to the House that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsden_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Marsden State High School
        </a>
        was named Australia's top secondary school of the year and Principal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Peach" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Peach
        </a>
        named the country's top public school principal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Special mention must also go to Marsden State High School teacher Fiona Pennisi-Mitchell who won an excellence award in the teacher of the year category. Adam Knights, the principal of Beenleigh State School, won an excellence award in the primary school principal of the year category; and Beenleigh State School overall won an excellence award for the primary school of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding the top prize to Andrew Peach, the judges said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Principal Andrew Peach embodies and lives out his school's vision: "Dare to Inspire, Make a Difference".
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend all the teaching staff and students of Forde for their hard work and dedication this year which has resulted in these excellent outcomes.
