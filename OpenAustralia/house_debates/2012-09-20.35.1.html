       <p>
        I am delighted to advise the House that the Australian government's Jobs and Skills Expo is coming to the Illawarra next Wednesday, 26 September, where we will be joined by the Minister for Employment Participation,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Ellis" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I am looking forward to welcoming the member for Cunningham and the member for Gilmore to my electorate and want to put on the record my thanks for their personal support for the expo. More than 70 local, state and national businesses, employment services providers, private recruitment agencies and registered skill training organisations will be on hand to offer their guidance and advice to job seekers. There will be full-time and part-time jobs in retail, hospitality, financial services and aged care. There will be jobs for blue-collar workers and white-collar workers, the trades and the professions. There will be apprenticeships, traineeships, casual jobs and much, much more. There is lots of local interest in work opportunities in the booming Pilbara, and I would like to thank Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill company for their participation in next week's expo as well. My electorate of Throsby is the only electorate outside of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        that will be hosting Roy Hill in their big recruitment drive for workers needed to construct their significant resources project in the Pilbara. Not only are Roy Hill coming along next week and helping to transport locals from around the region to the expo but they are also running a special forum on mining jobs in the Pilbara at the government's Jobs and Skills Expo. I strongly encourage local job seekers to come along and to see the variety of opportunities available at the expo and to meet potential employers face to face.
