        My question is to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister satisfied herself that any additional gifts or loans to the member for Dobell in relation to the settling of his defamation action with Fairfax Media Ltd have been disclosed by the member in his Register of Members' Interests?

        <p>
         To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question I would say the member for Dobell has amended his declaration of interests and he has advised me that he has disclosed all relevant matters. I can understand why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked this question: there was no way the Leader of the Opposition was going to ask about late declarations, was there?

          Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question of the Prime Minister. What involvement did the Prime Minister or her office have in negotiating the gift to the member for Dobell to settle his defamation action against Fairfax Media Ltd with Senator Arbib, the

           have now indicated that they intend to take a look. I understand they received some correspondence from Senator Brandis and they have responded to that. In those circumstances I believe it is inappropriate for me to comment further. I also believe, frankly, that for any member of the House who is subject to investigation by the police—and we know that one member of the parliament has been charged—or investigations such as those by Fair Work Australia it is incumbent on all members of the House to make sure—

            Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on direct relevance. My question related to the Prime Minister's involvement or that of her office and the Prime Minister can answer the question of her own knowledge.

              I was making what I thought was a very simple and commonsense point that, in relation to any member of parliament, I think the appropriate thing to do is for people to allow proper investigative processes, if they are being undertaken, to go through. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition is doing that in relation to a member of his team who has been charged with criminal matters—that he is applying that standard to a member of his own team. I would think, as a matter of fairness, he ought to apply that standard more broadly.
