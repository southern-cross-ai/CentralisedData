       <p>
        Employment self-sufficiency remains one of the major priorities in my electorate. It is being addressed through economic development initiatives designed to create more local jobs for a growing residential population. Recognising that the efficient movement of people and freight is one of the major factors in promoting growth of industry and productivity within our region, both the federal and state Liberal governments have been working cooperatively to invest in key road infrastructure necessary to facilitate the growth of businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        For our local economy to develop, efficient supply chains must be implemented through efficient transport, materials handling and logistics. Local businesses require distribution channels for goods by road, air and sea freight for export. Supply channels are required for inward-bound stock, bulky goods, construction materials and supplies. In addition, the development of our local tourism industry requires better transport connections between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Airport
        </a>
        and our iconic tourist attractions such as Hillarys marina, Joondalup Resort, coastal nodes and our regional city of Joondalup.

        The Mitchell Freeway Extension to Hester Avenue, incorporating the eastbound extension of Neerabup Road and the associated widening of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Wanneroo Road
        </a>
        and realignment of Flynn Drive, is on track for a midyear opening. The federal government has provided $209 million in funding for these roadworks, which are designed to provide access to the Neerabup Industrial Area, creating up to 20,000 new jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The grade separation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Reef_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Reef Road
        </a>
        intersection with Wanneroo Road, for which $20 million in federal funding has been committed, will provide an improved east-west link between Moore and the other major industrial areas such as Wangara. Similarly, federally funded major upgrades to the Reid and Tonkin highways as part of the $1.2 billion NorthLink WA project will provide a more efficient route to Perth Airport and key industrial areas such as Malaga, Welshpool and Kewdale.
       </p>
       <p>
        More locally, there is the widening of Ocean Reef Road and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfords_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Whitfords Avenue
        </a>
        to dual carriageways near the coast in readiness for the future Ocean Reef Marina redevelopment and growth in strategic activity centres. Similarly, upgrades at the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Hepburn Avenue
        </a>
        and Whitfords Avenue are also designed to alleviate traffic congestion as major development occurs along the coast and district centres. Major roadworks at the intersections of Ocean Reef Road and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joondalup_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Joondalup Drive

        are also designed to improve traffic movements.
