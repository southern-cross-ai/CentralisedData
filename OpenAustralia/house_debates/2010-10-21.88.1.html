        I am very pleased to rise today to talk about the great work done by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund. In particular, last Sunday I was very pleased to join with many other people in Adelaide in the Walk to Cure Diabetes. The walks took place in over 20 cities and towns around Australia, raising money for research into trying to find a cure for type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic and life-threatening illness and affects over 140,000 people in Australia. It often affects children and it is very important that we try and find a cure.

        to Cure Diabetes was a great event. It was held in Glenelg. It was a wonderful day with wonderful weather and I was able to join the youth ambassador from my local area,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Gordon" rel="nofollow">

        , a very cheerful 10-year-old who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in April 2008. Hannah has been a great inspiration to me, regularly telling me about what it is like to live with type 1 diabetes. But she is not just out for herself; she has done a significant amount to raise money for this important cause. On the day, she was sponsored by Visy Board and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Water" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and over the last year she has raised $7,507.50. This is a really significant amount and it is her enthusiasm and dedication to raising the profile of this illness and raising money for research into this illness that is really important. Hannah was joined by many members of her family, friends, people from her school and representatives from the sponsors. She said it was just a wonderful day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hannahâ€™s mother, Sonya, said that Hannah and her family were absolutely blown away by the support that Hannah got on the day. Hannah was shocked by the amount that was raised, including donations in the hundreds of dollars from people she had never met. Sonya said that it was great to see so many people out supporting such a fantastic charity, as diabetes is increasing among children.

        is the only charity dedicated solely to funding research to try and find a cure. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Hannah, her parents and the over 40,000 people who took part. They are on track across the country to raise $2 million. So I would like to congratulate everyone that was involved and I look forward to seeing Hannah back in
