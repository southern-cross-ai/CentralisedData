        Church, Asquith, which is celebrating its centenary. St John's has a rich history in our community. From the early years of the twentieth century, Anglicans living in Asquith,

        in Hornsby if they wished to worship together in a church building. In 1919, as the population continued to grow, the people of the area decided it was time they had their own building where they could hold services and start a Sunday school. Two blocks of land on which the church stands were purchased with 90 pounds raised locally, and the original church was constructed entirely by volunteer labour. The current church is the third to stand on the site. On 23 July 1921 the foundation stone was laid for the first church at Asquith. The completed church was dedicated by Archbishop Wright in April 1923. The first Sunday school was held at St John's on 1 May 1923 with 50 students attending.

        To celebrate the centenary, St John's has released a book titled

        . From the devastation of a life fleeing civil war in Sudan to the ordinary parishioner who meets the demands of living a Christian life in Australia today, the rich history of St John's is beautifully recounted in this book. I'd like to acknowledge the ministers Brian Heath and Tim Thambyrajah, children's minister Laura Bardell and Jenny Clarke in the office, as well as churchwardens Andrew Kingsmill, Denis Wright and Nicki Bispham, for their leadership and dedicated work for the church and the community. Happy birthday, St John's. Here's to a hundred more!
