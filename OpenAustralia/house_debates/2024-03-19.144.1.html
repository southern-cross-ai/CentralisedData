        These amendments to the Criminal Code are necessary to ensure consistency between the operation of this bill and section 83.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 which establishes an offence for providing military style training to a foreign government principle or foreign political organisation. These amendments clarify that, if a person is exempt from the new offences in the Defence Amendment (Safeguarding Australia's Military Secrets) Bill, the person will also be exempt from section 83.3 of the Criminal Code for the same conduct. I commend the amendments to the House.

        Ordered that this bill be reported to the House with an amendment.
