        Community safety and security matters. That's why I have joined with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Police
        </a>
        to launch a local crime prevention group in my electorate of Corangamite. I convened the inaugural meeting last week in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Armstrong Creek
        </a>
        , along with local leaders from schools, sporting clubs and community groups, who will help shape the Community Safety and Crime Prevention Group and the proactive approaches we will take to address local issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like many others, my region faces challenges relating to crime and safety. While our local police force work tirelessly to maintain order, the most effective way to combat crime is in cooperative approaches that harness the strength and resources of both law enforcement and the community. This new group will foster that collaboration, create a proactive approach and form a united front against crime and for a safe and secure community. This group will have a focus on the rapidly growing areas of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Duneed" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Duneed
        </a>
        , Armstrong Creek, the Surf Coast, Grovedale and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waurn_Ponds" rel="nofollow">
         Waurn Ponds
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It must be said that these are well-policed, safe suburbs, but there is a growing need for greater community engagement with local police. Our police put locals' rights at the heart of how they tackle crime, and they always welcome feedback by allowing our residents to voice their opinions, share experiences and suggest improvements. This group provides the perfect forum for that to occur.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community safety and crime prevention group will work with local stakeholders and members of the community to identify concerns, address community safety and receive crime prevention advice. The latest local data presented by police will be revealing and useful for the understanding of the types and extent of crime. Of course, Victorian police already have a strong connection with our local communities throughout the region. The crime prevention group aims to make these connections even stronger, with increased police involvement and engagement with local leaders and residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to keeping my communities informed about the actions and events that result from this new initiative. It's already reaping rewards, with the sharing of useful information and suggestions for upcoming events that raise awareness about community safety and better connect our rapidly growing communities.
