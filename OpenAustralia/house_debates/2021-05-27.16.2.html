        () (): On behalf of the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report, incorporating dissenting reports, entitled
        <i>
         Review of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Act 2018
        </i>
        <i>
         .
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report of its review of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Act 2018. After two years in operation, the review of the electoral legislation amendment act 2018 provided an opportunity for the electoral matters committee to ensure that the law is working as it should. The committee took the opportunity to check in on how the act's objectives can continue to be achieved in the most effective way while minimising red tape. The committee was also interested in the impacts of amendments to the original bill that are relevant to charitable-issue based advocacy, the operation of the amendments dealing with foreign donations and the clarity of public guidance products issued by regulators.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear from the evidence provided to this inquiry that, after an initial transition period, the act in its current form is working appropriately and not hindering the current activities of charitable based organisations. It is very positive that many members of the sector report that their organisations have gained familiarity with the definitions and find them workable. The committee notes there are a variety of conflicting views about possible amendments, but this reflects diverse interest from observers of the political system and is not suggestive of fundamental structural problems. The committee considers that the relevant parts of the act are working effectively and have become understood by affected groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to sincerely thank all of the stakeholders for their time in preparing submissions and appearing at the public hearing. I commend this report to the House.
