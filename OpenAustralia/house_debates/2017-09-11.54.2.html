            Thank you, Mr Speaker. Well, Australians are paying the bill for the blackouts created by the reckless energy policies of the Labor Party. I notice they're all making a sign of solidarity with the

                The Leader of the Opposition will not interject over the Manager of Opposition Business when he has a point of order to make. I'm going to say to both sides of the chamber, the level of noise, the waving of arms and the gestures are absolutely ridiculous. If, in that climate, you expect me to hear every single thing that's said then you know that's impossible. I'm going to say at this early stage, as I said last Thursday and I've said earlier, I'm not going to tolerate continual interjections, arm waving and gesturing through question time, as if members are at a sporting event. I'm simply not, and for those who I warn regularly, don't be expected to be warned and certainly don't expect that your penalty will only be an hour.

                            I don't know what frustrates the Leader of the Opposition more: the reality that his party in government—a government in which he was a minister—ignored the advice they received that their policy on allowing unrestricted export of gas from the east coast would put up prices and create tight supply, or that his friend, the member for

Now this is more a case of idiocy than ideology. Labor's energy policy has been driven by ideology and idiocy; together, it is an absolutely fatal combination as far as Australians' power bills are concerned. No forethought and no care whatsoever. So when they demand that we should take action—and, of course, as I'll describe, we already are—they're really saying, 'Please fix up the mess we created.' That's what they're saying.

                                 Since we made our announcement that we would take steps to restrict exports to protect the domestic market, wholesale spot prices in July were as low as $6 a gigajoule. They currently sit around $6 to $10 a gigajoule, down from $12 to $14 earlier in the year, so we are already seeing a result.

                                    My question is to the Prime Minister. Power prices have never been higher than they are under this Liberal government, now in its fifth year. The Prime Minister used to acknowledge that the fastest way to bring down power prices was to act on gas. Is the government refusing to pull the trigger on gas export controls because there are serious legal doubts about the ministerial actions of the Deputy Prime Minister? Why are doubts about his deputy standing in the way of lower power prices for Australians today?

                                     As I have just described to the House, the government's policy has already resulted in lower prices and more gas coming onto the market. The minister's determination, which is a determination that puts precise restrictions on exports, is one that was taken after a considerable amount of consultation and information and advice. And that comes from the agencies, from

                                     ; it obviously requires a lot of consultation and insight into what's going on in the industry. As honourable members will have heard, there is more gas coming into the market as we stand.

The policy is already working. We are getting the result that we need, and the minister will make the determination at the appropriate time when he has sufficient information to do so.

                                       I thank the member for Grey for his question because he knows how to stand up for jobs and small businesses in his electorate. He knows how to do that. We saw that with his keen advocacy for the changes that we have made to small business taxation to ensure that they are paying lower taxes, to ensure that we are cutting the compliance burden for small business, to ensure that we are evening up the playing field with changes to the competition laws and, in particular, putting downward pressure into everything we do when it comes to energy prices. We saw from the member for Grey the advocacy that is needed for regional communities when he stood up for the people of Whyalla and ensured that the steel plant continued to remain open, that a buyer was secured and that the support was there. But he is not the only member of rural and regional communities who knows how to stand up for their community. The member for Wannon stood up for the workers of Portland. He ensured that Alcoa stayed open and that the hundreds of thousands of jobs that depend on that plant remained open.

                                       , should take a leaf out of the books of the member for Grey and the member for Wannon. It is those members who are standing in the way of the sensible policies of the Turnbull government to put downward pressure on rising energy prices, especially for small businesses. The no-coal coalition of the Hunter members of those opposite have put up the white flag on all the coalmining and energy jobs that sit in the Hunter Valley. They stand against our plans to ensure that we sweat the coal-fired power assets for longer to ensure that we have greater stability in the energy market and greater stability of baseload power in the energy market. That is part of the Turnbull government's plan to put downward pressure on the rising forces on electricity prices.

Is the government now refusing to pull the trigger because there are serious legal doubts about Senator Canavan's ministerial actions, including doubts about him issuing the instrument which begins the gas export control process?
