                has brought together the three tiers of government with the private sector to advise the government on investment but also on regulatory and policy reform. Today we announced another milestone has been reached in our commitment to have single national transport regulators by 2013. This is important microeconomic reform that will have significant productivity benefits.

                 Those opposite dismiss this. They could not do it. They could not even try to do it in 12 years. We have replaced nine heavy vehicle regulators with one, replaced seven rail safety regulators with one and established a single national maritime safety regime. Today we announce that the Queensland government will host the future national heavy vehicle regulator. It is now setting up a project office to draft the necessary legislation and delivery arrangements. This will produce one set of rules delivered consistentlyâ€”a one-stop shop for trucking companies to access the road network and a national centre to drive improvements in productivity.

                  Those opposite dismiss this reform, because they simply forgot about the productivity agenda during their last period in office. They may have their position, but the conservatives around the country do not agree with them. The

                  opposition has promised to introduce Infrastructure New South Wales. The Tasmanian opposition are running in the Tasmanian election on introducing Infrastructure Tasmania.

                  government have announced the creation of Infrastructure UK. All of these bodies have been created based on the model established here in Australia. That model has led to real investmentâ€”record investment, in road and rail. It is not acknowledged by those opposite. Indeed the shadow finance minister had this to say:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  Can you take me to the area where the massive new sort of rail infrastructure is or can you take me to the area where the major roads are. Theyâ€™re not there, and the money is gone, but weâ€™ve got nothing for it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That is the attitude of those opposite. I say to them: go to the

                  and go to the national rail network, which now exists from Perth to Brisbane for the first time as a result of the economic stimulus plan of this government. They simply do not get it. That is why, in Senate estimates a couple of weeks ago, they asked no serious questions about infrastructure and they did not ask a single question about the national port strategy or the national freight strategy that Infrastructure Australia is delivering; they did spend half an hour asking about the number of pot plants in my office, because that was the priority of those opposite, because they simply do not take the infrastructure challenge of this country seriously.
