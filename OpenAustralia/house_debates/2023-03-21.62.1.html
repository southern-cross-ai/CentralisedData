         I thank the member for her question and ongoing advocacy for her community and for communities right around Australia when it comes to domestic and family violence. Domestic and family violence is the main reason women and children leave their homes in Australia, and it's the leading cause of homelessness for children. A woman shouldn't have to choose between being homeless and being in an environment that is dangerous to her or her children. The government is progressing significant investment to increase the availability of crisis accommodation through the Safe Places Emergency Accommodation Program. In the October budget the government committed $100 million of extra funding to deliver 720 additional safe places for women and children leaving violent situations, and work is underway at the moment with partners that will partner with the government in this, including family and domestic violence services, state and territory governments and, importantly, victims-survivors.
        </p>
        <p>
         This new round will seek to specifically help those that have an increased risk of experiencing domestic and family violence, including women living with disability and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         women.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a significant investment, but it's not the only investment that our government is making. The Housing Australia Future Fund will deliver the Albanese government's election commitment of 30,000 new social and affordable homes in the fund's first five years. The allocation of 4,000 houses and $100 million from the returns of the Housing Australia Future Fund will complement the Safe Places Program, providing affordable housing for women and children affected by family violence, for older women and for women at risk of homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important that the legislation to create this fund passes the parliament. Those who are delaying the passage of the legislation are delaying these homes being built. The opposition and the Greens must support us on this measure that will help millions of Australians. Housing for women and children escaping violence should be above politics. We should be able to put our politics aside and get on with the job. I urge everyone in this place and in the other place to support this legislation so we can have action now.
