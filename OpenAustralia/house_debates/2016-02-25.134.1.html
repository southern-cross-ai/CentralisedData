       <p>
        I am pleased to inform the House of progress that the coalition government and I have made in delivering serious and tangible infrastructure projects to my electorate of Capricornia. Such projects are designed to stimulate economic activity and employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, $20 million in new federal funding was announced for three key projects under the federal government's National Stronger Regions program. This includes $2.34 million for the Capricorn Rescue Helicopter Service to construct a new hangar and medical aviation centre in Rockhampton. The project involves a two-bay hangar with engineering facilities and much-needed space for doctors and medical teams to be on stand-by. We are providing $7 million towards the revamp and upgrade of the Rockhampton riverbank development on the Fitzroy in the city's CBD. The funding will support the Rockhampton Regional Council's project for better facilities and the opportunity for greater economic activity in the area. We are providing $10 million towards stages 4 and 5 of the Yeppoon beach foreshore redevelopment on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        as part of a major economic, job creation and tourist drawcard.
       </p>
       <p>
        These funds come on top of $9.9 million in joint federal-state funding under the category D Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements to aid in the continued recovery from Cyclone Marcia. The funds, which relate to rebuilding damaged infrastructure to a more resilient level, will be spread across six projects, including $2 million to top up a fund in

         Livingstone Shire
        </a>
        — joint government funding now totals nearly $12 million for this project—to rebuild the Scenic Highway, or Statue Bay Road; $3 million to continue further rebuilding of Kershaw Gardens in Rockhampton; and $4.9 million towards strengthening the rebuild of Pilbeam Drive, Glenmore Water Treatment Plant,

        , Capricorn Street and Elphinstone Street in Rockhampton.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is recognised that due to the current mining downturn the local economy in Capricornia is doing it tough. The $30 million of investments in infrastructure I have just outlined will go a long way towards stimulating economic activity and job potential in these areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our federal coalition government has already been investing heavily in road-building projects to provide jobs to help offset the mining sector downturn. This includes $166 million to fix up the Eton Range section of the notorious

         Peak Downs Highway

        west of Mackay; $38.26 million to replace seven old bridges in the Isaac and Rockhampton shires under the federal Bridges Renewal Program; $8.5 million on overtaking lanes on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Highway
        </a>
        ; $15.5 million to construct three new overtaking lanes and to extend a fourth along the Bruce Highway from Rockhampton to Gladstone; $29.4 million in Roads to Recovery grants over five years to fix up council roads and streets; and $136 million to complete stage 2 of the Yeppen South project plan.
