        Ryan residents, families, businesses and community groups can hold their collective heads up very high, and as the federal member for Ryan I am very proud of all of them because the true spirit of Australia shone through last Friday evening, 20 February. The true spirit of Australia, the character of Australia and the compassion of Australia shone through by means of the Ryan constituents putting their hands up and saying, ‘We would like to show just how much we care about the deaths, the victims and the families—all those who suffered because of the catastrophic bushfires in Victoria.’
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Friday, 20 February, at the Hotel Indooroopilly, more than 300 local residents and representatives of local businesses and community groups donated some $10,685 to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire Appeal. This was organised with only four or five days real notice to those who participated. We held a local community concert, and I want to take this opportunity in the

         Parliament of Australia
        </a>
        to thank all those who made this evening possible. First of all, I would like to thank Mr Paul Currie from Kid Rock Productions, a local musician and teacher—a man who has a deep love for music. He arranged for his very talented young musicians to perform to provide the evening’s entertainment. I also want to thank, obviously, the Hotel Indooroopilly, who very generously provided the venue free of charge. They also put on a sausage sizzle for all the guests who came that evening. I want to thank those who made a contribution to the evening’s raffle items and silent auctions, including Nautilus Scuba Centre and Forte School of Music, and also Sonnic Beatt Sound and Lighting Productions, who provided all the equipment for the evening’s concert. They very kindly came from all over Brisbane and donated their skills and equipment so that there was no charge incurred there. I also want to thank

        , the local newspaper that partnered with us and helped to promote the concert.
       </p>
       <p>
        But in particular I want to thank the young people of the western suburbs of Brisbane. I want to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenmore_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Kenmore State High School
        </a>
        students who gave their evening for this very worthy cause. Two young musicians of enormous talent gave up their evening to provide the entertainment, and their talent was admired by all those in attendance. I want to thank them here in the parliament today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Emma Gage sang beautifully. Her parents, Ross and Therese Gage, through their business, Westside Swimming, organised a donation of some $1,600 towards the evening. It was inspiring stuff, and to anyone who questions the character and compassion of our country I say that this answers any questions, doubts or reservations you might have. It was just a marvellous occasion. Also from Kenmore State High School, Chloe Hill played the flute beautifully, and really everybody was in awe of her talent. These are two outstanding young Australians whose lives are going to be enriched because of their musical talents and who have clearly shown that the spirit of Australia shines through not only at Kenmore State High School but also of course in the western suburbs of Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the head of music at Indooroopilly State School, Jill Elsworth, and the principal, Hilary Backus, for encouraging their students to perform. Young pianist Chai Jie Low played a beautiful piece so marvellously that she had the audience entranced. She was accompanied by Astrid Raschke, Lila Cassidy, Ellen Lynch and Chandra Choudhury. It makes me proud not only as the member of parliament representing the electorate of Ryan and the western suburbs of Brisbane but also as an Australian because they were just marvellous.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank especially the Veteran’s Support and Advocacy Support Association, VSASA, based at Toowong. They donated a cheque for $5,000 for this. What can one say but thank you so much for showing just how marvellous a country we are. They are a community group that does wonderful things for our veterans, but on this occasion they contributed so much to other Australians whose lives have been torn apart by this force of nature.
