         I thank the member for his question and acknowledge his service. Shortly the government will be releasing its response to the independent review of our surface fleet. This will be a blueprint for building the most capable

         in almost a century. But it's important to understand where we're starting from. We inherited from those opposite the oldest surface fleet since the end of the

          Second World War
         </a>
         . We will fix that, but it will require money and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've heard a lot of noise from those opposite when it comes to defence spending. But they have a record which is plain to see. If we're to take them at face value, one point they're making is that where they left the defence spend was inadequate. In last year's budget—

The policy of those opposite is stuck in 2022. What's worse is that the Defence Strategic Review revealed that in the last five years of their government they effectively cut $20 billion from defence—

                Red Sea

               . For the past few months they have been saying that, if ever asked, they would send a ship to the Red Sea. But it turns out that when they were asked, when the Leader of the Opposition was in charge, they said no—and his excuse is that he didn't know a request had been made. He's asking the Australian people not to blame him; he was just asleep at the wheel.

               and quantum, and all the while the shadow minister for defence had been preparing to overwhelm our adversaries with overhead projectors and a slide! They were hands-down the worst defence government in our nation's history. The Albanese government is willing to stand up and lead and make difficult decisions to keep Australians safe.
