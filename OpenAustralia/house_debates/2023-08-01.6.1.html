        I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and

        ) Amendment (Industry Self-Classification and Other Measures) Bill 2023. The coalition supports this bill. The bill draws heavily from the work of the Stevens review, which was originally commissioned by the coalition government. The review considered a whole range of issues in relation to classifications, and this bill deals with some of the less controversial matters related to that area of policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The changes in the bill are quite straightforward. The primary purpose of the bill is to streamline the classification system to deal with high volumes of content, particularly relating to online films and computer games. The bill aims to achieve this by expanding options for self-classification using accredited classifiers. The new system would be designed to reduce processing times and the costs associated with classification application fees. There would be safeguard mechanisms to deal with concerns about the performance and standards of accredited classifiers or their decisions. Other changes in this bill would provide classification exemptions for non-English-language films for libraries and museums and would broaden exemptions for cultural events and exhibitions. A classify-once principle would also be applied to reduce the duplication of classification processes for materials already approved for broadcast.
       </p>
       <p>
        The national classification scheme carries out important work. It sets out the regulatory framework for classifying films, computer games and publications. In his report into the classification scheme Mr Stevens noted that since the scheme was introduced in 1995 new platforms, including subscription video-on-demand services, broadcast video on demand, livestreaming platforms, online games, social media and mobile apps, have become common. The review pointed to the growing volume of content requiring classification, particularly online films and games, and recommended action to reduce time frames and costs. Mr Stevens recommended self-classification by people trained and accredited by the regulator, who could be either in-house staff or third-party classifiers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill expands options for self-classification by allowing film and computer game content to be carried out by accredited persons. It sets up a new classification scheme to allow content providers to use classifiers who have been trained and accredited by the government to self-classify content. The government points to a number of safeguards in this system, including requiring accredited persons to be of fit and proper character and to have carried out relevant training and that accredited persons cannot classify films that are likely to be rated X or 18-plus or refused classification. Importantly, the person's accreditation may be suspended or revoked by the classifications board, and the board may also revoke the classification set by an accredited person.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Stevens review had been told that public libraries were increasingly finding it difficult to source films in languages other than English for their culturally and linguistically diverse communities. This was the case because it wasn't commercially viable to pay the cost of a classification for a relatively small number of copies of a foreign film to be purchased for libraries. Mr Stevens recommended the development of an exemption for unclassified films in languages other than English for supply to public libraries. The bill seeks to enact this recommendation. The bill also seeks to broaden classification exemptions for content used during organised community events run by approved cultural institutions to now allow the exemption at routine events or exhibitions. As a member for one of Australia's most multicultural electorates, I know these changes will be welcomed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Stevens review highlighted that, under existing arrangements, classification ratings cannot be carried over between broadcast
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        and other platforms such as video on demand. As a result, the same content broadcast on television and any other platform must be classified twice. The bill seeks to pick up on recommendations from the Stevens review to reduce duplication and apply a 'classify once' principle for broadcast content. I also note that the explanatory memorandum for the bill states that cost-recovery arrangements for industry self-classification may be considered in a future budget process. While fees may be applied for accreditation and for training purposes, the bill states that such fees must not be such as to amount to taxation, importantly, and can be used only for cost-recovery purposes. These changes will happen to fee recovery by regulation, and it's imperative that these costs be kept to a minimum to ensure the intent of the Stevens review is delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said at the outset, the coalition will support this bill. These changes pick up on the work we commenced to update Australia's classification systems. They are also in line with our election commitment that the classifications system should be modernised to keep pace with content being produced today and tomorrow.
       </p>

        Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.
