        This afternoon I rise to speak of a great Gladstone entrepreneur and character, Pieter Groen-In't-Woud, who sadly passed away on 20 November. On Monday, I had the honour of attending his funeral, along with many others whom this man had touched with his unique personality. Whilst Pieter was only 69, he had led a full life. Listening to the various speakers on Monday, he appears to have fitted two lifetimes into one. Pieter was known for his passion for life, hard work and ingenuity. His passion for his work was unbelievable. Most importantly, his love for his wife Barbara and children, Saskia, Marya and Anthony, and their families was exceptional. His generosity was above and beyond reproach. Whether it was time or money, he was always had plenty to give. Pieter's final farewell was attended by many who had travelled from overseas and others travelled from all around Australia. It shows the mark of a sincere, true man when so many people travelled so far to say goodbye to a true gentleman. To finish, I would like to give a quote from Pieter himselfâ€”and he had quite a few:

        Rest in peace, my friend.
