       <p>
        I rise today to talk about an incredible young person in my electorate of Macarthur who, just one year after undergoing spinal surgery, has earned the title of Australian inline skating champion. Jaide Gayle-Weiling of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrington_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Harrington Park
        </a>
        was diagnosed with sudden onset idiopathic scoliosis at the age of 13. Jaide, who was named Australian champion in the 100 metres, 500 metres and 3,000 metres races for girls under-17, had a condition which caused severe curvature of her spine.
       </p>
       <p>
        Specialist Dr Andrew Cree, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         The Children's Hospital
        </a>
        at Westmead, advised that, if left untreated, the condition would eventually kill her. Jaide underwent a six-hour operation where two 50-centimetre-long titanium rods were inserted and clamped to her spine with 18 screws. The operation is considered so dangerous that each patient risks paralysis or even death. Despite Jaide's operation being a success, she still had to spend a week in intensive care, had to learn to walk again and was forced to undergo intensive recuperation and physiotherapy programs. Remarkably, within three months of the operation, Jaide was skating again.
       </p>
       <p>
        One year on from her life-threating spinal surgery, and at the young age of 14, Jaide has earned the title of Australian inline skating champion. What a remarkable achievement. Jaide is an inspiration and a credit to her community. Her ability to overcome adversity and achieve great results in a short period of time is a lesson to us all. Jaide will be travelling to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        over Easter to represent Australia at the Oceania Inline Speed Championships. I am sure that everyone listening to proceedings in the House is extremely proud that Jaide is representing our country, and I wish her all the very best for the future.
