        My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform. How is the government building a stronger, fairer Australia for pensioners?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Capricornia very much for that question, because this government is all about making sure that after a lifetime of work we provide security and support to our older Australians, especially those on the age pension, as part of building a stronger and fairer Australia. That is why from today Australia's 3½ million pensioners will start to receive the latest increase to their pensions. If you are a single pensioner on the maximum rate, you will receive an extra $35.80 a fortnight. If you are a pensioner couple on the maximum rate, you will receive an extra $54 per fortnight. These increases also include Labor's clean energy supplement, which has been added to make sure that pensioners have extra help with their bills. That will add up to $13 a fortnight for singles and around $20 a fortnight for couples. All of this is about making sure that we give the extra support to pensioners that they need. The Prime Minister has already indicated that from today the government has also decided to lower the deeming rates. This will be particularly advantageous to those part-pensioners who are reliant on their investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is the case, as the member for Capricornia knows, that millions of Australian pensioners are better off as a result of this Labor government. This government has made sure that since 2009 there have been improvements to the pension. In fact, if you look at the amounts, single pensioners on the maximum rate are now $207 a fortnight better off. Pensioner couples on the maximum rate are $236 a fortnight better off. They are better off because of this Labor government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pensioners know that under Labor their pension increases will be guaranteed. They also know that this Leader of the Opposition will reach into their pockets and take this money straight out. He will claw back the money out of the pockets of pensioners. If you are a single pensioner, $350 a year will be taken out of your pocket by this Leader of the Opposition and $530 a year will be taken out of the pockets of pensioner couples. That is what this Leader of the Opposition would do to pensioners if he ever got the chance.

          Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. The minister has talked about the increases in pensions for senior Australians; how will these benefit my local electorate?

           I thank the member for Capricornia again for her question. I am sure, like me, she saw an article today in her
           <i>
            Morning Bulletin
           </i>
           from Rockhampton about two local pensioners—Jim and Marion Lawler—who are among the 20,000 pensioners in Capricornia who are better off as a result of this government's improvements to the pension. In fact, I can inform the member for Capricornia that there are around 20,000 pensioners in Capricornia who will receive the new clean energy supplement from today. They will receive it as part of their pension every fortnight. For single pensioners in her electorate it is around $13 a fortnight and for pensioner couples like Jim and Marion it will be $20 a fortnight. That adds up to a lot in the area represented by the member for Capricornia—$6.3 million from the clean energy supplement alone.
          </p>
          <p>
           What her electors need to know is that this Leader of the Opposition will take that $6.3 million out of the electorate of Capricornia. He will claw that money straight out of the pockets of pensioners like this family. Jim and Marion will lose $530 a year if this Leader of the Opposition gets—
