        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline the government's plans to help small business to grow and create more jobs.

         I do thank the member for Dawson for his question and for his support for the 13,000-plus small businesses in his electorate. Thanks to this budget, small businesses right around our country are investing in their future. When they invest, they invest in the future of their workers and their customers. I have been around much of the country over the last 10 days or so. I can report to the House that, thanks to the instant asset write-off, Steve Geiger Cabinets in Mackay, in the member's electorate, will be upgrading their workshop. Thanks to the instant asset write-off, CIBO Espresso in Glenelg, in Adelaide, will be refurbishing their cafe. Thanks to the instant asset write-off, Dolci Sapori in Clayfield, in Brisbane, will be refrigerating their van. Lonsdale electrics here in Canberra will be investing in diagnostic computers.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can inform the House that small business like the tax cut. They like the extra assistance to employ people. They really like the instant asset write-off. But what they like most of all is finally being singled out and acknowledged, not just with words but with practical measures to help them. We all know—even members opposite know, despite their shouting—that small business is the engine room of the economy. We all know that small business is the locomotive of job creation. We all know—and even members opposite will sometimes concede—that small businesspeople mortgage their houses to invest, to employ and to serve their communities. But this is the first time anyone can remember when small business have been singled out in this way by government, which is giving a fair go to the people who are having a go. This government understands that when you help small business you help everyone, because when small business does well everyone does well.

         It is worth remembering just how well received this budget has been. I particularly want to quote the head of

         </a>
         —and MYOB certainly know something about small business. They described the budget as:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … fantastic … for small business owners who should be celebrating all around the nation. Firstly because of the financial support to assist them to invest in and grow their businesses, and secondly because of the recognition of the critical role they play in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
         The only person who was sour about the budget was Labor's small business spokesman—none other than the Leader of the Opposition—who said it was 'A giveaway to start a fire sale at second-hand car yards and
