         for his question. Yesterday the civilised world condemned developments in Libya. Today we face the question of what to do about developments in Libya.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Gaddafi" rel="nofollow">
          Colonel Gaddafi
         </a>
         has made clear his intentions. His words are chilling: he has threatened to purge Libya—‘house by house, inch by inch’—of the protest movement. He has threatened slaughter and punishment by death. He has called on the Libyan public to ‘capture the rats’ of the protest movement. These are the words not of a responsible political leader; these are the words of a dictator out of control.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday, the Australian government together with governments around the world called in Libyan ambassadors, at least those who have not defected so far, to register international political condemnation of these statements and the actions of the Libyan regime.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday I also instructed Australia’s permanent representative to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         to write to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSC" rel="nofollow">
          UNSC
         </a>
         president calling on the council to convene and also to consider the powers available to the council to protect the civilian population of Libya.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Security Council
         </a>
         has now issued a statement which contains the following provisions: that the council condemns the violence and the use of force against civilians; that the council deplores the repression against peaceful demonstrators; and that members of the council call on the government of Libya to meet its responsibility to protect its population.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that this is one of the first times the United Nations Security Council has invoked the doctrine of the ‘responsibility to protect’ in one of its statements. This doctrine was introduced in the international community in the post Rwanda world.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government welcomes the statement in the last 24 hours by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League" rel="nofollow">
          Arab League
         </a>
         , under Secretary General Moussa, which, following its emergency session on Libya, made a decision to suspend Libya from the meetings of the Arab League. We believe this important statement by the Arab League stiffened the resolve of the United Nations Security Council against some of the resistance which may be encountered in the council on this most important responsibility to protect the civilian population of Libya.
        </p>
        <p>
         Depending on developments now in Libya, there are further steps available to the United Nations Security Council. We are following these developments in the council most closely.
        </p>
        <p>
         The United Nations Commission on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
          Human Rights
         </a>
         has a critical role now to play in responding to human rights abuses in Libya. It is obscene that Libya has been chair of that council in the past. It continues to be obscene that Libya remains a member of that council.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is critical that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Human Rights Council
         </a>
         in Geneva use the opportunity to present an immediate factual report on human rights abuses in Benghazi, Tripoli and elsewhere in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is time for the international community to remind the Libyan regime and its leaders that crimes against humanity fall under the Rome statute in the jurisdiction of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" rel="nofollow">
          International Criminal Court
         </a>
         . As a result, members of the regime could be held accountable for mass casualties which occur as a result of the actions of the regime. Libya of course is not a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC" rel="nofollow">
          ICC
         </a>
         ; it would therefore be a matter for the members of the UNSC to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court for its consideration. Other measures possibly include targeted sanctions; the imposition of a no-fly zone, which would prevent Libyan aircraft from attacking civilian targets as they have reportedly done; and the declaration of an arms embargo.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government remains seized of developments in Libya. It is difficult and dangerous, and we continue to attend to our consular responsibilities.

          On indulgence—the wave of civil unrest that has been unleashed across
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" rel="nofollow">
           North Africa
          </a>
          and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
           Middle East
          </a>
          has a number of common causes, particularly socioeconomic causes—high youth unemployment and high food prices—but also the overwhelming human desire for greater freedom from repressive regimes.
         </p>
         <p>
          The response to the demonstrations has varied country by country, whether it is Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco or Algeria. But the crowd control, Gaddafi style, in Libya has been unconscionable, despicable and inhumane. The coalition supports the government’s words of condemnation as laid out today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We certainly support the government taking whatever steps it can to express Australia’s shock and horror at the way the people of Libya have been treated by the ruler of that country, a most vile dictator.
