        My electorate of Capricornia takes in a huge chunk of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        from Rockhampton to Mackay and out to the Belyando country in the west. Not only does Capricornia have a vast array of different landscapes, scenery and industries; it has a great variety of people. It is these people I am proud to represent and these great people that keep me driving forward in my role in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        One shining example is Chelsea Line. Chelsea is a young woman and a ray of sunshine, whose love for life and passion for a cause are truly infectious. She is a cheerleader, a gymnast, a student and sometimes, I'm led to believe, a little bit of a ratbag. None of this is strange for an 11-year-old girl, but what makes Chelsea's efforts all the more impressive is what she faces every day with type 1 diabetes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 24/7 grind of living with this chronic disease can of course be a struggle, and I know just how serious Chelsea and her mum are about raising awareness to help find a cure. Earlier this year, Chelsea and Rebecca visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        with a tour of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDRF" rel="nofollow">
         JDRF
        </a>
        families, and it was an absolute pleasure to be able to catch up with them both and discuss the continued need for support for diabetes sufferers. Chelsea got a real thrill by getting to see a few things most visitors to parliament don't get to see—one of the benefits of being Nationals whip.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chelsea told me type 1 diabetes is associated with a significantly increased risk of serious health complications, including blindness, heart disease, stroke and nerve damage. Rebecca told me she and Chelsea want us politicians to understand that a cure would mean everything to them. The very idea of a life free of emergency hospital trips, 3 am wake-ups and blood sugar finger pricks is something like heaven. I stand with Chelsea and Rebecca in supporting efforts to find a cure for diabetes and to make each sufferer's life a simpler, safer, healthier one.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chelsea and Rebecca are very active members of JDRF, the leading global organisation funding type 1 diabetes research. JDRF Australia is built on a grassroots model of people connecting in their communities, collaborating regionally for efficiency and a broader fundraising impact, and using an international stage to pool resources, passion and energy. This grassroots approach means that people who are actually dealing with the ravages of type 1 diabetes are the ones who are telling the stories and driving the message.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year Chelsea and Rebecca play a pivotal role in organising the JDRF Colour Run in Moranbah—a great event that really puts the 'fun' in fundraiser. This year's colour run is coming up on 14 October, and I encourage everyone, wherever you are, to go to Moranbah and take part in this terrific event that not only supports tough kids like Chelsea but also provides help for a cure in the future.
