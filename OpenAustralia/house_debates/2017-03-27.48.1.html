        I recently had the pleasure of visiting Featherbrook prep to 9 college in my electorate. This is a brand-new school in the electorate. I was invited to discuss democracy and Australia's political process. It is always an honour to speak to students about the role of government. I firmly believe that, if students are taught to be active participants in the political process, the community and the country will be better for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my part of the world, there are many suburbs and housing estates that did not exist 10 to 15 years ago. Featherbrook prep to 9 college is in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Cook" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which now boasts a population of 40,000 and did not exist 15 years ago. Families have only recently moved in and are beginning to establish their cultures. The work of building community is difficult. It will be up to the young people in my electorate to actively build the type of community they want to live in. That is why it is important that these students not only understand politics but know that their local members are accessible and approachable. This is integral to them having trust in political process.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank Kerry Clayton, the principal, for the kind invitation and the student leaders in this brand-new school for spending time with me that afternoon: Manasvi, Stavriana, Madison, Teaokatoa, Gina, Karthik, Logan, Neo, Lika and Tiarnan. I wish you well in your studies, I wish you well in the leadership of your wonderful new school and good luck in building the community that you all envisage.
