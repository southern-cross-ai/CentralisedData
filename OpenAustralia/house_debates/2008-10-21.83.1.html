        This month we remember women who have suffered from breast cancer. We look at the research that has taken place in the area of breast cancer treatment and we consider what we can do to address this serious illness. It is also known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
         Pink Ribbon
        </a>
        month. I know that last week in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        we had a breakfast to commemorate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
         Breast Cancer
        </a>
        Week. Soon all throughout the electorates of each and every member here in this chamber there will be morning teas and events being held to remember those people who have suffered from breast cancer, to get information out to the community so that we can pre-empt the diagnosis of breast cancer and to inform women about the signs that they need to look for when they are examining their breasts and the actions that they need to take. It is a time when we remind women that they need to have regular mammograms and we try to raise funds for vital research in this area.

        On Tuesday, 27 October I will be holding a morning tea at Gwandalan Bowling Club in conjunction with the Gwandalan Lionesses. The Gwandalan Lionesses have already undertaken a very innovative fundraising exercise for breast cancer research. They have given some of their money to the Cancer Council and some to the Jane McGrath Foundation, as I understand. The women of the Gwandalan Lionesses have also put together a very tasteful calendar. In this calendar they have very little clothing on. It is unique. They are selling the calendar for $10, and the Lionesses have been overwhelmed by the demand for it. I went to the launch of the sale of the calendar and I was very impressed by the support within the community for the calendar.

        On Friday, 30 October I will be having a morning tea at the Gateshead Windale Bowling Club. Once again, we will have excellent speakers there. Professor Forbes will be addressing the meeting, along with other experts in the field of breast cancer. A similar situation will happen at Gwandalan with experts on breast cancer addressing the morning tea. These are outstanding events and I am sure that the community will get behind them and support them.
