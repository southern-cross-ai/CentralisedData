       <p>
        I rise today to talk about an issue that is of great concern to me. I am pleased that I have been joined by my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n colleagues here in the chamber, because I know it is of deep concern to them. My concern is about this government's lack of vision for jobs in South Australia. This government has shown a complete contempt for South Australia and for the jobs in our state.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be no surprise that in this budget there is no new money for jobs. You only have to look back at how this government has approached
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        jobs to see how they abandoned Holden and the car manufacturing industry in South Australia. This government abandoned not only Holden but every single one of the component manufacturers in South Australia, with a token effort of $20 million to try and help component manufacturers adjust. That is not enough money to help with the many thousands of jobs in auto components manufacturing.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, this budget contains more cuts to jobs, which does not fill South Australians with any confidence. In the budget it was announced that 140 people who work in the Health Workforce Australia in South Australia will have their jobs cut. Indeed, people are being made redundant as we speak.
       </p>
       <p>
        The jobs of some of our top military scientists and engineers based at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Science" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Science
        </a>
        and Technology Organisation in Adelaide are being cut. Many jobs are now at risk. We also need to add this government's decision not to commit to building ships in Australia. The government is not committing to the 12 submarines which are so critically important to jobs in South Australia. That puts at risk the jobs of approximately 1,100 workers currently working at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
         ASC
        </a>
        in Adelaide; it also puts at risk potential future jobsâ€”the jobs that could come from a boom in submarine building in South Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has shown contempt for South Australia and for jobs. I am appalled. I am glad the minister has just come into the chamber because I call on the government to seriously consider the impact that their decisions and this budget is having on jobs in South Australia and on future jobs in South Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government is telling young people to either earn or learn. Where is their industry plan to ensure that jobs in South Australia grow? Where is their plan for future manufacturing in South Australia?
       </p>
       <p>
        The South Australian government is taking the lead on this, and I call on the federal government to be upfront and to partner with the South Australian government and the South Australian people to promote manufacturing and jobs in South Australia. Please do not abandon South Australia in their time of need.
