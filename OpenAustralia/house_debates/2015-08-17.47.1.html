       <p>
        Today I would like to bring attention to a very special organisation in Bonner. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EACH" rel="nofollow">
         EACH
        </a>
        social activity club has made a huge difference to the lives of a number of people in Wynnum and surrounding areas. Just recently I had the pleasure of having afternoon tea with members of the group. It was great to catch up with everyone and hear members' stories about how EACH has changed their lives for the better.
       </p>
       <p>
        EACH is a fully federally funded program that has provided vital social and community health services across Australia for over 40 years. The EACH activity club opened in Wynnum just one year ago, and already it has grown to around 150 members. These members can choose from 16 activities a week, including aqua therapy, gentle gym, gardening and book club, and can take part in day trips as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        EACH not only provides valuable social support to older Australians in our community but also expands their networking opportunities. Two people at EACH Wynnum were able to set up their own businesses through partnerships built by the club. EACH Wynnum has partnered with local services including the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Meals on Wheels to enhance the services on offer to its members.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank coordinator Tracey Slater and everyone at the club for their lovely hospitality to me and for the wonderful service that they provide to vulnerable people in my electorate. I am pleased to report more people are taking part in EACH's club activities every day. I look forward toâ€”
