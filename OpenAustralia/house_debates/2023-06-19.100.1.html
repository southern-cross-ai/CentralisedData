        and Territories. Last week the Albanese Labor government fulfilled an election commitment that saw local governments across Australia come back to the table after 10 years. What foundations has this laid for the future of local government across the country?

         I want to thank the member for his question, a very important question. And I want to acknowledge the new lord mayor of Parramatta, Sameer Pandey, who I sat next to, the first lord mayor of subcontinent descent in our country.

         Last week the Albanese government delivered on an important commitment for the local government sector by bringing back the

         to Canberra for the first time in a decade, an election commitment. We delivered on this government's promise to bring local government back to the table, an election commitment that brought together 650 local government representatives from every corner of Australia, from the

        <p>
         There is a local government in every town, every village, every city across this country. Our solutions, we need to listen to, are locally led. Achieving net zero emissions was a significant theme across the forum, and local governments were acknowledged as leaders in this space. That's why we supported them, with the announcement of a community energies upgrade fund, a $100 million Australian government investment which will co-fund energy efficient projects across local communities, from pool heating upgrades to energy efficient lighting for sporting ovals. I want to thank Minister Bowen and Assistant Minister McAllister for this announcement, because they are listening to the sector. The forum also highlighted our refreshing approach to grant programs, new community infrastructure programs, growing regions and thriving suburbs. The forum discussed how transparent, merit based, community based programs need to be done. It also—

           Those opposite really didn't value the sector, because they froze financial assistance grants, which has had a significant impact on every local council across the country, and we're still seeing that today. This side of the House have brought forward financial assistance grants to this year, and in the next couple of weeks, they will receive their entire allocation of the 2023-24 financial assistance grants, because we know how important it is to back the local government sector. We're listening to local communities through local councils. We are committed to building strong partnerships with our local governments to improve service delivery, to capitalise on our strengths and to help them tackle the big issues that are affecting their community. The clear message from local councils across the country was how refreshing it was that they now have a prime minister and a government that value their voice, that want to work with them, that are committed to the sector and that will be there for them day in, day out.
