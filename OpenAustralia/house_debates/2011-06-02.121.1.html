       <p>
        It is in our Australian psyche to help out our mates. It is also in our Australian psyche to help those in need. When we see others in pain, when we see others struggling, Australians are the first to go to their assistance. We saw this firsthand earlier this year with Australians' unprecedented response to our summer of disasters, and we saw a similar level of response to events that happened overseas, particularly in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and Japan.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, Australians react not only to disasters. We understand that it is not the headlines that determine the time of need. For many that need is present every day. Since coming to this House I have been honoured to have the opportunity to acknowledge the work of many of the tireless volunteers in my electorate of Ryan. Together with all Australian volunteers—34 per cent of the Australian adult population volunteer—they contribute over 700,000 hours of volunteer work each year. This is an estimated value of $75 billion to the economy per annum. As I said, it is in our psyche—it is our Aussie spirit.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why I rise today to applaud the Australian Volunteers for

        program. Bringing together AusAID,

        </a>
        , this program collaboratively provides Australians with easy access to international volunteering opportunities. These organisations have extensive experience in international volunteering and will place volunteers on assignments which are aligned with Australian aid priorities. By supporting volunteers with a basic monthly living and accommodation allowance, the program makes available international volunteer opportunities to all Australians and allows our volunteers to live within the communities they are serving. This will bring about on-the-ground, bottom-up change for communities in developing countries and allow volunteers to immerse themselves in an experience so very different to what we have here in Australia. Living like this sees our volunteers develop a strong understanding of local and cultural issues, which helps to build a connection between Australia and many of our close neighbours. In this day and age, it is important that we all become global citizens. A key part of this is making any exposure to the wider world as accessible as possible, particularly to those with altruistic motives. Bringing these organisations together supports this, giving Australians a wealth of opportunities to make a lasting difference to communities within developing countries. It is mutually beneficial—Australian volunteers contribute to reducing poverty and long-term development whilst gaining invaluable personal skills, understanding, and experience.
       </p>

        This program will have a significant impact on many people's lives. The individual organisations have deployed thousands of volunteers since their establishment, and their achievements are truly remarkable. During their 60-year tenure, Australian Volunteers International has: developed many projects, including Fiji's first sign language dictionary; trained the first Hamlin College of Midwives' graduates in Ethiopia; established Timor-Leste's first national park; and assisted in drafting Swaziland's first child protection and welfare bill, to name just a few. As this demonstrates, one of the great benefits of this program is that it deploys some of our most skilled Australians not only to assist with hands on projects but to teach and train, fostering independence. It gives communities a hand up, not just a hand out. It is a truly beneficial component of our Australian aid program.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a personal note, a future innovation I would like to see developed as a part of this program is to have it extended to encourage our school leavers to take the opportunity to volunteer. Whilst the program does encompass our Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development, it would be wonderful to see our year 12 graduates use the time they have after finishing school in November to be a part of international volunteering, perhaps even as an alternative to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoolies_Week" rel="nofollow">
         Schoolies Week
        </a>
        . There are many similar initiatives being undertaken by high schools around the world. I believe it would be an unforgettable experience for our young school leavers embarking on their adult lives and it would enhance the Australian Volunteers for International Development if it were expanded to include this initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to conclude with a quote from the Red Cross, an organisation very close to my heart as I serve on their Queensland board:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Voluntary service is one of the fundamental principles of Red Cross. It is at the heart of community building because it promotes trust and reciprocity. It encourages people to be responsible citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Volunteers for International Development is an outstanding program. I commend its efforts and look forward to seeing it flourish.
