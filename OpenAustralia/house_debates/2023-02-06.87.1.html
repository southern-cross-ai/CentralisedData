        all say that no new coal or gas projects can proceed if we are to meet climate goals. But the Labor government's first emissions projections names seven new giant gas projects that you will open up before 2030, including Beetaloo, Scarborough, Narrabri and Browse. In a time of climate crisis, why is Labor opening new coal and gas mines under its Safeguard Mechanism?

         I thank the leader of the Greens for his question. This government is committed to taking action on climate change. We have legislated targets. We have legislated to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The Minister for Climate change and Energy is working hard with industry and with anyone else who wants to consult with the government on the Safeguard Mechanism. The Safeguard Mechanism will be one of the main ways by which we and the industry itself—any emitting industry, whether it's gas, concrete, agriculture—will have to reduce their emissions. We have said consistently on this side of the parliament—the government has said consistently—that projects will only go forward if they stack up environmentally, socially and economically. We will not be sponsoring them. They will happen if they are able to happen and they meet those very tight restrictions.
        </p>

         This government is committed to net zero emissions by 2050. We know there is a climate crisis around the world, and we will not be adopting Greens based policies that are economy wrecking. We will continue to make sure that this economy keeps working. To be frank, we all know that parts of this country will continue to need gas for at least the medium term and that it is an important part of minerals processing and manufacturing. These are just the facts of where we are. That is why making sure it's a net zero emissions aim is so important. We're committed to this, we've legislated for it, we will make it happen, and I do hope that the opposition come along with us to make sure it does happen.
