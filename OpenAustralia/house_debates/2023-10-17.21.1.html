       <p>
        I was proud recently to represent the parliament, along with Senator David Fawcett, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
         NATO
        </a>
        parliamentary gathering in Copenhagen. On the way home I stopped by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        to visit our Australian soldiers who are working with the British military to train Ukrainian soldiers for the defence of their homeland against the illegal and immoral Russian invasion. I am very proud of these soldiers, who are from Darwin, in my electorate. They're from the 5th Battalion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        and also from the Combat Health Battalion and the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. It makes you so proud to see our soldiers in action. They truly are the world's best.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their mission is to train the Ukrainian soldiers so that they are able to go to the front line and defend against the Russians and push them out of their nation. They're imparting skills, knowledge and a good fighting attitude that the Ukrainian soldiers are going to need to survive on that battlefield. I'm also really proud of those young Ukrainians, and it was good to tell them that in person. Our soldiers are the best, they're doing a cracking job and they should be rewarded for that effort.
