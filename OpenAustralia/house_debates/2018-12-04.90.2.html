       <p>
        Under this government, we are also making good progress on closing the gender pay gap. It was 17.2 per cent when we took office in 2013, and it is now at a record low of 14.5 per cent, although we know that there is still more work to be done. Women must be safe in their homes, online, in their community and at work, and this bill will assist to make that a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank those people who are working hard on the front line, helping to provide the housing, the counselling and the comfort that is needed to those families who are experiencing family or domestic violence. To all of those work colleagues who are also caring for those people experiencing family or domestic violence: we thank you too. We must, as a community, be absolutely united. We must be united in sending a very clear message: family and domestic violence is unacceptable anywhere, any time. This bill will provide important workplace protections to employees experiencing such violence, and I urge all members to support extending this important safety net entitlement to all workers under the Fair Work Act.

        <p>
         The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Gorton has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question before the House is that the amendment moved by the member for Gorton be agreed to.
