        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I introduce the Building and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_Industry" rel="nofollow">
         Construction Industry
        </a>
        (Improving Productivity) Amendment Bill 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        The building and construction industry is a vital sector of the Australian economy. Ensuring an efficient, safe and law-abiding building and construction industry is crucial to promoting jobs, driving economic growth and managing the transition to a more diversified economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why the government last year re-established the Australian Building and Construction Commission to ensure building work is carried out fairly, efficiently, lawfully and safely for the benefit of all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        A crucial factor to drive reform and boost productivity is the content requirements for enterprise agreements contained in the Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is achieved by prohibiting restrictive clauses in enterprise agreements that limit the ability of a contractor to manage its business or improve productivity, as well as those that give unions disproportionate power on building sites.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill amends the expiry of the transitional 'grace period' from 28 November 2018 to 31 August 2017, for enterprise agreements made before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Building Code
        </a>
        commenced on 2 December 2016. While new enterprise agreements made after 2 December 2016 must comply with the code, building industry participants covered by existing enterprise agreements will have until 31 August 2017 to ensure their agreements are code-compliant.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also limits the exemption to building industry participants submitting expressions of interest and tendering for Commonwealth-funded building work. This means enterprise agreements will need to comply with the Building Code before contracts are awarded and work gets underway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the bill makes appropriate transitional arrangements for those who have submitted an expression of interest or tendered for relevant building work from 2 December 2016 until the bill's commencement to ensure they remain eligible to be awarded that building work until 28 November 2018. For the avoidance of doubt, if a building industry participant submitted an expression of interest or tendered for building work on or after 2 December 2016 and was awarded that work before the commencement of schedule 1 of the bill, the building industry participant is entitled to undertake, or continue to undertake, that work after the commencement of schedule 1.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill does not introduce any new requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments will ensure key provisions of the Building Code that seek to improve productivity and reduce costs will be achieved in a more timely fashion.
       </p>
       <p>
        In turn, this will create the conditions needed to fund the construction of more schools, hospitals and other important social infrastructure, at a price we can afford.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that basis, I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
