        These are a set of technical amendments which go to further the effective operation of this code, and they are designed to give effect to the government's policy intention and take account of a number of technical matters which have emerged during the process of the bill being considered. For example, the amendments include measures that would provide for the simplification of the requirement in the code for the advanced notice of algorithm changes. There's clarification that arbitration will be balanced—that is, the arbitrators should consider the reasonable cost of both the news media business and digital platform. The code will stipulate, for the avoidance of doubt, that remuneration that is arbitrated is to be made in the form of a lump sum. That is the effect of one of the other significant amendments before the House, and the amendments clarify the information that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        can provide in the arbitration process. There's an amendment to give effect to the government's policy intent that the code should not interfere with existing contractual rights. There's an amendment to ensure that the anti-avoidance provisions can take effect from the commencement of the code.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments are very much about enforcing the overall policy intention of the code and the legislation which embodies it and make a series of technical and clarifying amendments, and so I commend the amendments to the House.

          I refer to the designation process under the code and the requirement for designation in order to enliven the provisions of the code. I ask the minister: What digital platforms and services does the government intend to designate? When is it intended that this will be effected? And, in line with that, on what basis will the government decide what platforms and services it will so designate? I refer to the number of commercial deals that have been struck in recent days between Australian news media and the platforms—in particular, Google, in this case. Will the designation—including the timing and the actual services and platforms that will be designated—be done on the basis of how many commercial deals are secured under Google News Showcase? Is it another measure that the government seeks to employ in identifying when and what services will be designated? So I ask the minister those questions.

          <p>
           I thank the shadow minister for those questions. As we've consistently made clear—and, indeed, as the legislation provides—designation will be a decision of the Treasurer on the basis of advice given to him by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           . As the Treasurer has previously indicated and as the government has indicated, our thinking is that the services to be designated would be the search product of Google and then the Facebook News Feed; those are comments that the Treasurer has made previously. As the shadow minister rightly notes, there's been an announcement to the market by Seven West Media that it has concluded an agreement with Google, and there have been reports of a number of other deals presently being negotiated, and that's certainly consistent with the government's understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, the policy intention of the code is to encourage commercial negotiation. It is an example of a negotiate-arbitrate model, as the shadow minister would be very familiar with from her previous professional experience. Negotiate-arbitrate is widely used in telecommunications, and there are similar structures in other industries that the ACCC regulates.
          </p>
          <p>
           So in response to the specific question 'What is the government's intention as to what will be designated?' I make the point that the Treasurer has made previous comments about that—about the scope—but that ultimately it will be a decision for the Treasurer, based upon advice provided to him by the ACCC, and that advice will be given against the backdrop of the overall market conditions, including and of course informed by what has been the extent to which deals have been done and who the parties are to those deals. So those are all factors to be considered. But the government's position in relation to how the designation process will work has been consistent. The framework is clearly set out in the bill, and ultimately it will be a decision of the Treasurer, based upon the advice he receives from the ACCC at the time.

            <p>
             I thank the shadow minister for the question. The government have been very clear, all the way along, that we will legislate this code, as we have said—and we acknowledge the support of the opposition and of the minor parties, as manifested in the report of the Senate committee. We acknowledge the concern expressed for the objective of a vigorous news media sector by the opposition and by the minor parties.
            </p>

             In relation to whether Google is likely to stay in Australia or exit Australia, I think what we can conclude is that the behaviour that Google has shown in concluding the deal with Seven West Media, as disclosed by that company, and in the behaviour that we understand it's presently exhibiting in being in advanced negotiations with other Australian news media businesses, is I think, in any view, the behaviour of a company that intends to stay in this market. After all, certainly under the deal that's been announced to date, there is obviously significant value passing from Google to Seven West Media. So that is the behaviour of a company which intends to stay in this market. The government welcome the behaviour that has been demonstrated, and we have been consistent from the outset: we wish to see Google and Facebook remain in this market. That's our preference. As the Digital Platforms Inquiry itself reported, over 19 million Australians use Google every month and over 17 million Australians use Facebook. Of course, what we also expect them to do—as we expect any company to do that is doing business in Australia—is to comply with the laws passed by the duly elected parliament of Australia.

How will smaller publishers avail themselves of collective bargaining under the code? And how will the imbalance in the bargaining power between the news media and the digital platforms be addressed if the government elects not to designate any platforms or services?

              <p>
               I will make a couple of points. The intention of the code, from the outset, has been to encourage commercial negotiation reflecting the underlying policy position, as advised to the government by the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                ACCC
               </a>
               , that there is an imbalance of bargaining power between the news media businesses, on the one hand, and the digital platforms, on the other. The consequence of that has been that commercial deals which would ordinarily occur in a market which did not have these serious market power issues have not been occurring.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our first preference is that there be commercial deals. That of course is why it's known as a 'negotiate-arbitrate model', because if you can negotiate a commercial outcome then you never need to go to arbitration. But, of course, what the government clearly recognises is that you need to be in a position to impose the arbitration process if a commercial deal is not done.
              </p>
              <p>
               I know the shadow minister is asking about various possibilities, but I want to be very clear: the code provides a process under which the Treasurer can designate services of digital platforms, and that will be considered by the Treasurer when he receives advice from the ACCC. So no conclusion should be drawn as to how the Treasurer's going to deal with that issue; he will deal with that issue on the merits, based upon advice from the ACCC and having regard to factors such as the number of news media businesses which have advised the government that they've entered into commercial deals. So that will be a very live consideration.

                 Well, again, I make the point that we could work through a number of possible outcomes. Our focus is on getting this bill passed into law so that the code comes into force, so we are then in a position to designate and, of course, to register news media businesses, which is the requirement on the other side. Our whole intention is to establish this so that deals are done, either commercially or through arbitration. We're focused on getting outcomes for news media businesses of all sizes, and passing this bill is a key step toward achieving that outcome.

                  The bill empowers the minister to make designation determinations. Does the bill give the minister the flexibility to carve out or mix and match certain services with different elements of the code? To put it another way, would it be possible for the minister to designate

                      News media businesses are subject to significant legal risks regarding user generated content, which means the ability to manage these features is increasingly important. News media businesses submit that the provision of moderation tools for managing user comments on digital platform services should be included in the code. This was provided for in the exposure draft of the bill but was removed from the bill that is now before the parliament. Why were these provisions removed?

                       I thank the shadow minister for the question. She's right to say that there were provisions dealing with this in the initial draft of the code that was released by the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                        ACCC
                       </a>
                       for public comment. The government took the view that ultimately this code was not the appropriate place to include such provisions. The government recognises that this is an issue that presents complexities for news media businesses. That's particularly as a consequence of a decision in, I think, the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">

                       —certainly a decision some time in the last year or two in one of our courts. There is a process presently underway, being led by the attorneys-general collectively—and I believe it's the New South Wales Attorney-General who is leading that process—recognising that defamation matters are state responsibilities. That is a process that offers an opportunity to consider the issue the shadow minister raised.

                       <p>
                        On the same point, I note that the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
                         SBS
                        </a>
                        , in its submission, said:
                       </p>
                       <p class="italic">
                        The absence of these safeguards places audience at risks of harm through exposure to illegal or inappropriate online content or harmful conduct on social media sites. The introduction of these safeguards would complement the work of the eSafety Commissioner, the purpose of which is to 'help safeguard Australians at risk from online harms and to promote safer, more positive online experiences'.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I note that the eSafety Commissioner also works with social media services to remove abusive or illegal online content material. The inability to moderate or switch off comments also has a chilling effect on the distribution of news, as media organisations will avoid posting stories that will require higher levels of moderation.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        So, as I note from SBS's previous submissions, the safeguards should include the ability to remove or filter comments, to switch to premoderation and to pause live video comments. In light of all this, does the minister stand by his answer that he's just given that it is appropriate that these provisions that were in the exposure draft have been removed from the bill now before us?
