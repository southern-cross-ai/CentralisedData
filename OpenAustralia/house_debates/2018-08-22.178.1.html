        Today I rise to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dunn" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Dunn
        </a>
        , a well-known and hardworking member of the Mackellar community. Robert has had a long and distinguished career as a solicitor, business owner, local mayor and councillor. In 1973, following his time as a solicitor, Robert founded Dunn Legal, a law firm in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Mona Vale
        </a>
        that has become a trustworthy alternative to CBD law firms for northern beaches residents. Dunn Legal's practice areas include wills, estate planning, business sales and intellectual property protection. Robert's legal career has seen him protect the legal rights of many Australians, often at trying times in their lives, with Dunn Legal maintaining a reputation of client focused respect and diligence. Dunn Legal's success and longevity are a reflection of the hard work that Robert has put in and the poise with which he manages the firm. It is always inspiring to see local and small businesses not only form on the northern beaches but continue to thrive over the years. Small businesses are the largest employers of Australians and are most worthy of praise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert has also left his mark on local politics. He served as mayor of the first elected
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittwater_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Pittwater Council
        </a>
        from 1992 to 1994, following a number of years as a councillor. In 2005 Robert ran as an Independent in the Pittwater state by-election following the resignation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brogden" rel="nofollow">
         John Brogden
        </a>
        , with this effort showcasing his commitment to and passion for the local area. He also ran against my predecessor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronwyn_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
         Bronwyn Bishop
        </a>
        for the seat of Mackellar, in the 2004 federal election, scoring 7.7 per cent of the vote. It is my great hope that Robert does not choose to contest Mackellar again in the near future, or I may be in trouble!
       </p>
       <p>
        An honourable member: Go, Robert!
       </p>
       <p>
        Hence I'm praising him so much in this parliament!
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2013 Robert released
        <i>
         Pittwater Uprising!: A Secessionist's View
        </i>
        , his seditious personal memoir about the formation of Pittwater Council. The memoir goes into incredible detail regarding the events and dramas that went on leading up to Pittwater becoming a local government area. It serves as a great reminder as to Robert's involvement in Pittwater and northern beaches life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today Mona Vale is home to Robert Dunn Reserve, a park alongside Mona Vale Beach that stands as a tribute to Robert's work for the local community. It is a spot of great beauty, overlooking the vast ocean, and it encapsulates the great natural beauty that draws so many people to the northern beaches. I'm proud that the electorate of Mackellar is home to individuals like Robert Dunn who have spent years giving back to the community and making efforts to improve the lives of others. Robert's achievements in law, politics and community work make him an incredible role model, and I urge you all to learn from his example.
