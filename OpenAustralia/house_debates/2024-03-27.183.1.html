        I want to talk about two amazing people from the Hunter electorate. Singleton local Joel Wightman recently travelled to the United States to compete in six rounds of the 2024
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMA_Supercross_Championship" rel="nofollow">
         AMA Supercross Championship
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunter" rel="nofollow">
         The Hunter
        </a>
        has yet again produced another great athlete in Joel.
       </p>
       <p>
        The AMA Supercross Championship is a world-class event, where the best riders race. This trip fulfilled a lifelong dream of Joel's. What makes this trip extra special is the fact that Joel is a privateer, meaning that he has paid his own way to this event without big sponsors. Joel backed himself, but he has also had the backing of our entire community on the trip—getting up early in the morning to watch the coverage from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        . I'm sure that after this trip he also has many fans, not just around Australia but around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every round of the AMA Supercross Championship is painstakingly important as riders compete under pressure for points that accumulate over each round. Joel competed very well and plans on returning to the US in May to compete in later rounds of the championship in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Denver. In the meantime, he'll be helping other motorcycle riders in the Hunter at Pro-Moto Suspension at Singleton. He is a legend at home and a legend abroad. Congratulations, Joel, and good luck in May.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to recognise another Hunter local, Daniel Maher. Every minute of every day a child is admitted into hospital in Australia. In that moment, they often receive a diagnosis that turns their world upside down. Sadly, smiles disappear and life is filled with hospitals, doctors, needles and pain. Wanting to help make a difference, Daniel took part in the Starlight Super Swim, which saw Daniel swim an incredible 25.5 kilometres over 29 days to raise money for sick kids. I don't know about you, but one lap is a long way. But 25.5 kilometres is 510 laps of an Olympic-sized swimming pool; it's an amazing effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        Daniel hit up family, friends, his work colleagues and maybe even a local federal member for donations. He raised an impressive $1,509.87. The funds he raised directly support Starlight's vital hospital services, including the Starlight Express Rooms and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Starlight" rel="nofollow">
         Captain Starlight
        </a>
        . But, not happy with this total, Daniel hit up his employer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBE" rel="nofollow">
         QBE
        </a>
        , and asked them to double it. They did, and it took his final tally to $3,019.74—an impressive effort. Well done, Daniel. To QBE and to everyone else that helped raise money for Starlight Super Swim: thank you, all, and thank you for what you do. We need to make sure that we continue to donate to charities like this to really make a difference in sick kids' lives.
