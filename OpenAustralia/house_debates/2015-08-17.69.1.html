        My question is to the Minister for Immigration. Whistleblowers last week reported that up to eight people extensively spied on Senator Hanson-Young over three days, including in her hotel room. On June 11 you said allegations of spying were completely fanciful. But you have been silent since last week's revelations. Can you guarantee to the parliament that, in your portfolio area, no senator or MP has been spied on by government contractors under your government's watch?

          <p>
           Thank you, Mr Speaker. There have been allegations raised in relation to Senator Hanson-Young. I made some comments in response to that, and I made it very clear at the time that the government has been involved in no such activity. The government has not provided any direction or sanction toward any sort of spying on Senator Hanson-Young—or anybody else in this place, for that matter. There is a dispute, as I understand, between Wilson's, the contractor, and an employee. That issue remains ongoing. If there are allegations to be heard as part of the Senate inquiry, I am happy for those allegations to be investigated. But suggestions that somehow the government has been involved in some sort of spying activity are a nonsense.
          </p>
          <p>
           The point that I make, otherwise, is that the government have been successful in relation to Operation Sovereign Borders, stopping people drowning at sea and removing children from detention, because we have had, as part of that program, regional processing centre arrangements. The regional processing centre on the sovereign territory of Nauru is, ultimately, the responsibility of the Nauruan government. Equally, it is the case in Manus that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
            PNG
           </a>
           government has responsibility for the operations in the regional processing centre on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
            Manus Island
           </a>
           . The government provides financial support to enable those activities to take place.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have made it very clear in the past that we expect people within the centres, both as detainees and as employees—in fact, domestically as well—will act within the law. I expect people to be treated with dignity inside the centres. If there are allegations to be made, they are to be properly investigated.

              The government have been successful in relation to Operation Sovereign Borders not only in relation to regional processing centre arrangements but also because we have been able to turn back boats where it has been safe to do so. Whilst the Greens would never acknowledge it, the fact that we have stopped the drownings at sea is one of the most significant achievements of this government. When the Labor Party were in government—and they were in government with the Greens—1,200 people drowned at sea.

                We will not allow that mistake to be made again. When Labor and the Greens were in government last under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, 1,992 children found themselves in detention. We have reduced that number to closer to 100, with the intention to drag it to zero. I will not be lectured by the Greens and I will not be lectured by the Labor Party when it comes to border protection policy.
