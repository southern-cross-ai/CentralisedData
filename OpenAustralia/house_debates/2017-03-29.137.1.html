        I did not rise to speak about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , but after hearing the Labor member for Lingiari talk about GST in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        , which is run by a Labor government, I cannot ignore it. I just mention to any
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        ns listening that the Labor member was complaining about the fact that their ratio has dropped to 4.66, while Western Australia's ratio is at 0.34. So this has become a national issue, I think. I know
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        realised it. He acknowledged it back in 2007 and said he would fix it, but he did not. But our Prime Minister has at least started the conversation about the floor in the systemâ€”meaning putting in a minimum floor. At the same time he has written to all the state premiers to initiate that program. I think he should be acknowledged for the work he is doing to put some fairness back into the GST distribution system.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would now like to update the House on some of the projects in Swan that the coalition government has delivered. I recall when I was first elected to parliament as the representative for Swan, the new members' briefing advised that the work of a member could be broken up into three roles: parliamentary, party member and constituency representative. The latter has always been my priority, representing the good people of Swan in the great state of Western Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken previously in this chamber on how important it is to me to be the representative of Swan, to consult with the community, to establish the needs of our electorate and then develop a plan through which we are able to meet those needs. I am very proud of the projects I have been able to deliver during my nine and a half years as the local member.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like in any growing community, a big part of those needs is delivering community infrastructure that benefits our community and actively assists. I am eager to continue working with constituents, local governments and organisations in the electorate of Swan in achieving and delivering results that are of great benefit to our fantastic community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before we came to Canberra last week, I made a visit to the Belmont City Bowling Club to see their $12,000 grant from the Stronger Communities Program, which was able to be used for some new equipment, which I spoke about last week. That is just one example of how the coalition has made a difference in the Swan community. From the two rounds of the Stronger Communities Program more than 20 local clubs and organisations in Swan have been given funding to help improve their buildings and facilities. This is something I am very proud to have achieved for the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the other community groups that have benefitted include: South Perth Senior Citizens Centre; the Victoria Park Swimming Club, which has an upgraded fitness centre; the Belmont Men's Shed, new tools and equipment; the Belmont Toy Library, fitout and equipment; Manna Inc, a new van for transporting the people who come to their place to get free meals during the day; the Curtin University Boat Club, which has a new trailer and trolley; the Dynamic Flame Badminton Club, to purchase new equipment;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Football Club
        </a>
        , for new equipment and some dugouts around the boundary of the oval; and Connect Victoria Park, for reinvigoration of Connect Victoria Park, which is one of the local not-for-profit organisations in the electorate. There are many more, and all of these grants have made a huge difference to the local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition has also made a considerable investment in tackling crime in Swan. Since the coalition was elected in 2013, with the assistance of another

        member, Mr Keenan, the member for Stirling, we have been granted $145,000 for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        cameras in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Belmont" rel="nofollow">
         City of Belmont
        </a>
        . I spoke to one of the local sergeants the other night who said that they had been very useful in their system and have been helpful in apprehending criminals who are taking advantage of cars parked in car parks. On top of that, we are in the process of funding $300,000 to upgrade lighting in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Town of Victoria Park
        </a>
        to tackle crime in hotspot suburbs such as Burswood and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James" rel="nofollow">
         St James
        </a>
        , where at the moment the lighting is dull and inefficient.
       </p>
       <p>
        And then we have countless campaigns that I have led for Swan. Some took longer than others, but in the end Swan has had great success. I also recall my campaign for something that is close to me, which is the campaign for better health services in the Belmont area. The Belmont area now has access to many great health services, which were lacking when I came into parliament. It includes a Medicare Office, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBF" rel="nofollow">
         HBF
        </a>
        office, the Belmont City Medical Centre and the Belvidere Street after hours service.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have more to say but I have another matter I would like to raise quickly. It concerns an article in
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        today about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
