       <p class="italic">
        (c) that the stark warning is a direct result of the Government's energy policies;

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediately stop its ideological crusade against energy technologies it does not like despite many of these technologies having reliably kept the lights on for decades;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) reinstate a technology-agnostic capacity mechanism as an insurance method to provide operators with the incentives they need to ensure a reliable synchronous energy supply in the grid.
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion deals with one of the most critical issues facing Australia today and into the future, our energy supply: our energy supply at present and our energy supply into the future. Before I was elected I thought of myself, and still do, as a recovering environmental lawyer. In that sense I want to mention the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle is a fundamental of environmental law. It states
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If a product, an action or a policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment, protective action should be supported before there is complete scientific proof of a risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've always supported our country moving to net zero emissions. The coalition supports that policy. However, this motion is brought particularly on the basis of the recent statement from the Australian Energy Market Operator's report that led to dire warnings about an increased chance of blackouts this summer that this country, particularly in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , has not seen since the 1970s.
       </p>
       <p>
        This demonstrates that the Labor government's energy policy, led by Minister Bowen, is going down the wrong path. Again, I would urge the minister and the government to exercise the precautionary principle. It now has the warnings from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEMO" rel="nofollow">
         AEMO
        </a>
        about the potential damage of getting off the boat before we're at the wharf. Minister Bowen has repeatedly claimed that he is leading an economic transformation bigger than the industrial revolution. That may well be the case. When leading a transformation such as this, however, it has to be done in a measured way. And, as I said, there is an old saying relevant to this debate, relevant to the rollout of such a transformation: do not get off the boat until we're at the wharf. The boat I'm talking about is the boat that has for centuries delivered us affordable and reliable energy. The government's policies on this at present, though, are driving the premature closure of baseload power generation and failing to replace the capacity as it promised it would.
       </p>
       <p>
        In that vein, then, the government's zealotry towards renewables and in looking only at renewables for our future energy supply is setting the whole renewables energy industry up for failure. A renewables-only grid has not worked in any country in the world. Minister Bowen is yet to demonstrate how it is going to work here. In fact, he now has evidence from the AEMO that at present—its current rollout—it is not going to be successful here either. We are in the process whereby around 80 per cent of our existing baseload energy will shut down by 2035 under this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians are paying some of the highest energy bills in the world. Australian families say this. Australian businesses say this. Wherever you go in the country, when we all move through our electorates, everybody is concerned about the cost of their energy. But policies such as the government's rollout and its refusal to look at anything other than renewables has caused this energy crisis. Most Australians are now paying $1,000 a year more for their energy than they were paying in May 2022; many in my electorate would be happy if they were paying only $1,000 a year more. Therefore, I call on this government to look at a hybrid model of technologies for our future. We cannot get off gas, which has served this country very well, until we have demonstrated sufficient baseload power to power our industries and to power our homes into the future. The government needs to stop now, look at the precautionary principle and roll out its transformation in a far more measured way.

           Australia is dealing with the consequences of a decade of chaos, denial and delay on energy security and action on climate change by the previous government, a decade which saw a staggering four gigawatts of dispatchable capacity exit the energy system with a mere one gigawatt entering to replace those losses. It's a failure that left the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Chamber_of_Commerce_and_Industry" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
           </a>
           to deliver a scathing assessment of the former government by stating, '
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
            The Liberals
           </a>
           past failure to deal with this reality left our energy sector in disarray.' It's a decade of inaction that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCI" rel="nofollow">
            ACCI
           </a>
           said meant that Australian businesses and households were now paying the price of the inaction of those opposite. From failing to act on energy security to hiding price rises from the public, these actions—or lack of action—of the former government paint a clear picture of a government that was not serious about addressing energy security or delivering cheaper energy for Australians. Their legacy is one of denial and neglect, resulting in a loss of capacity and surging energy costs, and seeking, yet again, to blame the new government for the consequences of their actions.
          </p>
          <p>
           But this isn't really about energy security to them. This is just another way for them to deny and delay the move to renewable energy and for our government to continue to take genuine climate action. A reminder to everyone, particularly to those opposite: renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy available today. And we know this because the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">

           said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Renewable energy is driving down the wholesale cost of energy, setting new records for minimum demand for electricity from the grid and driving emissions to record lows …
          </p>
          <p>
           That's lower costs and record low emissions.
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite this reality, we have an opposition that's entrenched in an anti-renewable fantasy. They constantly seek to delay the roll out of renewable energy, grasping at any argument and any solution they can find. Their opposition to renewable energy isn't only just ideological but an extension of their decade's long opposition to taking meaningful climate action. The urgency of addressing climate change requires immediate and sustained action, not further delays, not further distraction.
          </p>
          <p>
           In June this year we saw the former Deputy Prime Minister rallying anti-renewables groups on the steps of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
            Parliament House
           </a>
           . In last year's budget reply, we saw the Leader of the Opposition calling for nuclear power in Australia, despite the fact that experts over and over have continually made it clear that nuclear is incapable of delivering the solutions that we need today. Those opposite would prefer that we invest in technology that doesn't exist over technology that does exist. They live in a fantasy, rather than in reality. The Leader of the Opposition continues to vote against legislation aimed at reducing emissions and reducing power prices.

           The Sunrise Project's 2022
           <i>
            Climate compass
           </i>
           report reveals that four in five Australians are deeply concerned about climate change. Notably, the concern for climate change and the continued use of coal, oil and gas has been steadily increasing. According to the same report a remarkable 71 per cent of Australians agree that climate change is an issue that demands immediate action and 70 per cent acknowledge that Australia is already experiencing the effects of climate change. Perhaps the most compelling statistic is that 76 per cent of Australians agree that in the future our country should rely on renewable energy more than it currently does.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is clear Australians are not just concerned about climate change but are actively supporting the transition to renewable energy, and that's why Australians voted for a government that will take climate action, with renewable energy infrastructure at the centre of that action. And we're delivering it. Minister Plibersek is approving more than double the amount of renewable energy projects than her predecessor. Only an hour ago there was announcement for another solar farm, this one's in Marulan, that will power 56,000 homes without disrupting farming activities. Projects like these will help us get to 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030.
          </p>
          <p>
           Minister Bowen is making up for a decade of inaction from the Liberals. He's delivering $20 billion for infrastructure needed to transmit this renewable energy to areas that need it. Those opposite didn't fund the connection of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
            Snowy Hydro
           </a>
           to the grid. We're fixing that. We're delivering $1.3 billion in funds to help homes electrify, helping them take advantage of free or cheap renewable energy to power their homes. We're getting on with the job with a plan for cheaper energy and renewable energy.

           <p>
            I'm very pleased to rise today to second the motion from the member for Hughes because I'm deeply concerned about the stability of our electricity system under this government. On this side of the House we recognise you cannot have a strong and successful economy without a reliable energy system. Given the importance of the grid, the Australian Energy Markets Operator's dire warnings of blackouts this summer and beyond should concern everyone in this place. This warning should be enough to get those opposite to reflect on their ideological positions. The Labor Party took to the last election a nonsensical promise to convert our electricity market from a place of around 30 to 35 renewable energy to 82 per cent by 2030, which is only seven years away. I call it a nonsense promise because there was no road map then, nor indeed is there today, as to how we will get there. The Albanese government are determined to remove base load power such as coal and gas from the system and replace it with solar, wind and other renewable sources. The Minister for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
             Climate Change

            and Energy repeatedly claims he's leading an economic transformation bigger than the industrial revolution, yet Labor have refused to have Treasury complete any modelling on its energy plan.

            Australians are already paying some of the most expensive energy bills in the world under this government. This is despite their pre-election promise to lower electricity bills by $275. Yet it is clear Australians are paying more for the privilege of increased risks of blackouts. I understand that Labor choose to ignore questions surrounding detail, but surely the prospects of blackouts are enough to get this government to acknowledge it is putting us on an incredibly reckless path. How can this government possibly proceed with closing our base load power stations, and what is the solution—to install 22,000 solar panels a day and 40 giant wind turbines a month, attaching them to transmission lines that don't yet exist? They also pay lip service to renewable energy projects up and down the coast of

            , many of them proposed to be in my electorate of Durack. However, what they don't tell you is that this energy is probably not going to be returned to the grid, lowering prices and making sure we have a reliable energy source, but rather used to create ammonia for export. I ask: is this a hydrogen revolution, or is it simply a hoax? We're told this rushed transition to renewables is needed to avert the worst climate scenarios, including significant increases to climate related deaths. Let me tell you: in Durack what saves lives are very good air conditioners. Air conditioners save older Australians, especially in my part of the world, where they have incredibly hot summers, but they're no good in a blackout. As we head towards summer, let's hope WA Premier Cook doesn't need to get coal from Newcastle, like he had to do last summer, to make sure we kept the lights on and we kept the air conditioners on in what was another hot summer in Durack.

            Another nonsensical element of this transition is we are consistently told weather patterns will become harder to predict, yet this government plans to make our grid significantly more reliant on the weather. On this side of the House we understand renewables are of course an important part of the mix. In fact during our time in government we were able to boost the share of renewables in the system whilst keeping energy prices low. We led the world in rooftop solar, with in one in four households taking it up. But by going all in on renewables you are setting the grid up for failure. A successfully functioning electricity grid does not exist without base load power. The climate wars are over, but the energy wars have begun. The only way Australians are going to secure victory in this battle is if Labor move past their radical positions on energy. What is needed is an-all-of-the-above approach to this energy transition, not ministers like

             We also need to recognise that gas still has an important role to play and will continue to do so for decades. Not only does the gas industry, particularly in my state of WA, employ thousands and provide a reliable source of baseload power; it is also helping reduce emissions as countries shift away from coal.

              The opposition has engaged in hyperbole with this motion, when for 10 long years the coalition government did little to address the need for energy transition. Now in opposition they have the temerity to claim that any problems faced by the grid are entirely of the making of the Labor government. They were the ones that over three years ago promised $1 billion to support 3,800 megawatts of new generation but delivered not one dollar and not one kilowatt. They are the ones who have the track record of four gigawatts of capacity leaving the system but only one gigawatt put back in.

              The market is speaking. Green energy is cheaper. Only the opposition would consider that the government is following an ill-informed pathway by decarbonising the grid. We are acting to fix the mess left behind by those opposite, delivering overdue policy certainty and investing in the cheapest form of energy—renewables. We're making up for a decade of inaction with a $20 billion Rewiring the Nation fund. We are implementing the Capacity Investment Scheme to increase new dispatchable capacity and to ensure reliability. We delivered more than $1.7 billion for the Energy Savings Package in the last budget, for energy savings upgrades for homes, business and social housing, to cut bills and reduce pressure on the grid.

              In the electorate of Cunningham, steps are being taken to assist Australia to build a strong and clean energy future. A proposed offshore wind zone is currently out for consultation, and I had many conversations in the recess with my community about our future energy needs. I have had many of those conversations with young people in my community, who are particularly concerned about our environment. They are a generation that have seen nothing but the effects of climate change: volatile temperature differences, fires, floods, erosion and habitat loss. This worries them. They know that we need to look at new ways to generate strong, reliable and renewable energy. Businesses in my community have sent me the very clear message that in the future they need strong, reliable and renewable energy. Major manufacturers know that they are going to need renewables to produce their products, not just because of the cost but also because the market is going to demand clean and renewable products.

This equates to the usage of about 150,000 households, and they're going to need 15 times that to make green steel. The offshore wind proposal for the Illawarra, if implemented at the current size, would generate enough electricity to power 3.4 million houses. BlueScope Steel will need about two-thirds of that amount of energy to keep our local steelworks open and producing green steel in the future. BlueScope currently employs 3,500 people directly in the Illawarra and is responsible for a total of 9,000 jobs in the region, including contractors and suppliers.

              Also locally, Australian Industrial Power, a subsidiary of Squadron Energy, is developing a 635 megawatt Port Kembla energy hub. While this project is in the early stages of development, it is indicative of the steps being taken by private investors as we move to new energy sources. It is renewable forms of power, not just any old power, which are going to sustain and grow thousands of jobs in my local community. Future energy generation will not be a task for a few communities in Australia; it will be a responsibility for every community and every household.

               The Albanese Labor government told the people of Australia that they had an energy plan to solve net zero. Their energy minister all too gleefully repeats this ad nauseam in the House, mocking anyone who dares to suggest differently. He believes he's leading an energy and economic transformation bigger than the industrial revolution. The minister and his colleagues are all aboard the reckless rush-to-renewables train, with no thought as to how the lights will be kept on in every house across Australia. As part of his push, at least 80 per cent of Australia's base-load energy will be shut down by 2035. Labor are looking for a renewables-only grid, and they are trying to convince the public that any other form of energy generation is some sort of evil. They are far from technology neutral. It is Labor who are the wreckers. They are wrecking our country's access to a reliable and affordable supply of energy.

               would seriously test supplies. While the biggest risk of blackouts is in January 2024, they could possibly occur from November. Supply shortfalls are also expected to drive wholesale electricity prices up, and it is families who will foot the bill. These shortfalls are being driven by a renewables agenda, with the federal government's ideology being carried forward by its Victorian Labor counterparts.

               Late in 2022, the Albanese Labor government introduced a price cap on the gas market. They were warned at the time that this would risk investments and throw the market into chaos, but they ploughed ahead. What was the result? Ian Mortlock, a tomato grower in my electorate, reported to me that he couldn't get his gas company to give him any more than a month-to-month contract. Uncertainty in the market creates uncertainty for consumers. Mr Mortlock was unsure about what he would do to continue his harvesting of crops. A confident market keeps the lights on and the power prices down, but Labor, at the helm of energy policy, hasn't been able to provide that. It is cold comfort that they didn't fully ban gas altogether, unlike their Victorian counterparts, under pressure from the Greens.

               We in the coalition have adopted an all-of-the-above approach because there are solutions to Australia's Labor induced energy woes if the government ceases its stubborn track and crusade. Coal-fired power stations have kept our power running for decades, but Labor will see them ripped out as soon as possible with no regard for how that will affect Australia's energy grid. Nuclear is being adopted elsewhere in the world and is proven to be clean, efficient and safe, but the energy minister speaks as if nuclear is some kind of bogeyman. He says that the coalition's proposal to use nuclear would cost $387 billion. However, his claims have since been rubbished. Former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the United States Department of Energy Rita Baranwal criticised the minister's maths. She is now a senior vice-president of Westinghouse in the United States, whose own small modular nuclear reactor cost around $1.58 billion and will be used to supplement renewable energy as a base-load generator.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bearing in mind that nuclear would be able to be plugged into existing grids—good story!—taking away the need for expensive new infrastructure and the destruction of social licence that comes with building transmission lines, particularly in my patch, nuclear can be part of a policy that will secure Australia's energy grid, cut emissions and also lower power bills.

               Our great island continent is blessed with abundant energy sources of every kind: coal, gas, uranium, wind, solar and more. Simple economics tells you that the sensible approach is not to put all your eggs in one basket. It's time for the Albanese Labor government and its energy minister to come clean. Their energy policies are hurting the country. They are hurting the grid that keeps our lights on and our appliances working. Most of all, they are hurting everyday Australians' hip pockets.

                I thank the member for Hughes for bringing this private member's business on energy supply to the chamber and I thank the member for Mallee for her contribution. If only the Liberals and Nationals had been in government for the past 10 years—Australia would be awash in energy! We would have nuclear power, nuclear reactors in every suburb and town in Australia. But where were they for the past 10 years? Oh: they were in government! Where were all these wonderful ideas from those opposite then?
               </p>
               <p>
                It's a bold move on the part of the member for Hughes, given the energy policy chaos inflicted upon the nation under the stewardship of her party when in government, to bring on this motion. The member came to this place in 2022, at the same time that her party was removed from government, so she may be unaware of the shocking truth of just how badly her side ran energy policy. For example, it was under the Liberal government that four gigawatts of dispatchable capacity left the grid and only one gigawatt entered it. That's a net loss of three gigawatts of energy in the grid over the term of the former Liberal government.
               </p>
               <p>
                For all their huffing and puffing and photo opportunities, with lumps of coal, cosplay, high viz and helmets, the Liberal government failed to maintain Australia's energy supply. It was the former Liberal government that led toxic crusades against renewable energy, with the former Liberal Treasurer even moaning about the view being spoiled by the turbines on the drive to Canberra—the poor thing! But it didn't stop there. The former government vetoed a $280 million loan for a 157-megawatt windfarm in northern Queensland because it was 'inconsistent with the objectives and policies of the Commonwealth government'—and too right it was; it was absolutely inconsistent with the qualities of that government. It says it all.
               </p>
               <p>
                The member for Hughes wants to talk about increasing power costs, so let's talk about them. Let's talk about how the Liberals kept rising energy costs secret when they were in government. When he was asked directly whether he knew about imminent wholesale energy price rises, the then energy minister and now shadow Treasurer, the member for Hume, said, 'No, I didn't.' But the member for Hume amended the industry code for electricity retailers three days before the May 2022 election was called, to delay the release of increases in the default market offer for

                 The Liberals

               </p>
               <p>
                In May 2019 the Liberals promised to deliver average wholesale prices of $70 a megawatt hour by the end of 2021. Instead, the average wholesale price at the time of the election, in May 2022, was $286.18. The Liberals promised that energy prices would decrease by 25 per cent. Instead, they rose by 240 per cent. More than three years ago the Liberals promised a billion dollars to support 38,000 megawatts of new generation. Not one dollar, not one kilowatt, was delivered. You could not even turn on a light bulb with what the Liberals contributed to the energy grid.

               <p>
                The Albanese government is fixing the mess the Liberals left behind. We are delivering policy certainty and investment credibility. We took a plan to the election, and we are delivering that plan. If the Liberals ever bothered to take an interest in Tasmania we could have told them long ago that the future was renewable. In the state proudly producing the most hydroelectric power in the country, proudly publicly owned, renewable energy powers industry, homes and small business across Tasmania. It delivers jobs and financial security for thousands of Tasmanian families and provides a blueprint for national renewable energy success. The Albanese government is making up for a decade of inaction with a $20 billion Rewiring the Nation fund to deliver long-overdue and desperately needed upgrades to our grid, with major projects in Tasmania already announced. Ten thousand kilometres of additional transmission lines will link cheap and clean renewable energy, including in Tasmania, via the Marinus Link to the existing grid. Five out of every six jobs that Rewiring the Nation provides will be delivered across regional Australia. That's good news for people living in the regions. But, instead, we have those opposite complaining about the impact of transmission lines on cattle and sheep.

                The Albanese government also delivered more than $1.7 billion for the energy savings package in the last budget and of course the energy bill relief that those opposite voted against. You can't come in here complaining about power price rises when you're voting against—

                 This motion is about blackouts, this motion is about energy and this motion is about what we can do to secure our future. We've just heard the member for Lyons talking about the Liberal government. He forgets also that the Nationals were in government with the Liberals. It's not always and all about the Liberal Party. Whilst I appreciate he's against the Liberals in Tasmania, the National Party was very much in a coalition government and is still in coalition with the Liberal Party. We will do everything that we can, united together, to hold this Labor-Greens-Teals government to account for high energy prices.

                 When it comes to energy prices, the now Prime Minister, the member for the inner-city Sydney seat of Grayndler, promised on no fewer than 94 occasions prior to the May election last year that power bills would be reduced by $275. I can well recall that social media tile popping up everywhere. No doubt it was boosted and sponsored by the Labor dirt unit to get out there to convince voters to put the number 1 beside the

                 </a>
                 candidate in their electorate. But there was no asterisk and then little riders or disclaimers saying that it was $275 by the year 2025. There was no disclaimer to say anything of the sort. It said that the Labor Party, in government, would reduce power prices by $275. It was a porky. It was a fib. Call it a lie, as so many have, because it wasn't true. It hasn't rung true.

                 Indeed, energy prices under the former coalition government came down by eight per cent in the last 12 months of its government. My energy prices at home came down, as did other people's home power bills, as did, just as importantly, the bills of business and small business. They are doing it so tough at the moment. They are the ones who go out every day and take risks. They employ people. They make things. They provide services. They have not been looked after by this Labor government, which came to office promising so much and which has delivered so little, so very precious little, in the time it's been in office since May last year. They've talked about a lot of things—things which haven't made a tangible, practical difference to the lives of ordinary, everyday Australians or to the benefit of small business, which runs this country. Those opposite have been happy to say that they are going to have home-grown, made-in-Australia, modern manufacturing, but, at the same time, they're shutting down the very source of power that those businesses, manufacturers and industry sector rely so heavily upon.

                 But don't take my word for it. I would encourage those opposite to talk to one of our meat-processing plants. I appreciate, at the moment, that they're making a small killing, pardon the pun, on the fact that animals—cattle, sheep—are realising such low prices at the markets. Indeed, a
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian" rel="nofollow">
                  West Australian
                 </a>
                 farmer offered 600 breeding ewes for free if someone just came and took them away. That's because of the live animal export ban. If the farmers aren't getting anything at the market and the prices haven't come down at the supermarket, the meat-processing plants are making, as I said, a killing. But they are also paying high energy costs—they, manufacturers, everybody right across this nation. What we're going to see come this summer is stress upon our energy grid. What we will see is blackouts. As sure as God made little green apples, we are going to see blackouts, and it's on Labor's watch. What are they doing about it? They are doing diddly squat, nothing at all.
