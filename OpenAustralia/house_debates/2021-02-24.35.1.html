        Moncrieff is a growing and thriving multicultural community, and the Gold Coast Hungarian Senior Citizens Club is one of the many community groups that enjoy the benefits of gathering together to do good work across our community. I acknowledge the president, Tamas Bozsik, and all of the members for the way they make our community more vibrant, and I say: sziasztok! What I really like about community groups is the way they welcome you with friendship and foodâ€”so much food!

        Earlier this month, I was very pleased to present 2020 Moncrieff Community Volunteer Awards to members of the Gold Coast Hungarian Senior Citizens Club at Broadbeach. Edit Hegyi received an award for being a wonderful volunteer at the club. Although Edit lives in Brisbane, every Tuesday she travels all the way to Moncrieff, where she is always the first volunteer to arrive and the last one to leave. She's more than happy to raise her hand to assist with the COVID-19 clean-up procedures. Theo Szinger received an award for being such a friendly volunteer. Theo generously supports the club by donating money for outings and he says that the smiles on the faces of the volunteers when they come back from their outings are worth their weight in gold.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I thank all of the members of the Gold Coast Hungarian Senior Citizens Club at the Broadbeach Senior Citizens Centre, where they convene, for the volunteer work that they do and the hospitality that they've extended to me from the very beginning, when I was a candidate for Moncrieff back in 2019.
