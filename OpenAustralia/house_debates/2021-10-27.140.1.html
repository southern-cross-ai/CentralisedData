        I rise today to recognise the efforts of all the individuals involved with surf lifesaving on the northern beaches and to congratulate the winners of the annual branch awards of excellence. This year the awards were held online on 6 August, and lifesavers and youth lifesavers were recognised for their contributions and achievements. The awards provide an opportunity to recognise the efforts of all volunteers to keep beachgoers safe and their commitment to the local community. These are members who donated their time and who go the extra mile in their contributions to surf lifesaving. Their dedication ensures that each beachgoer in our community is safe when they spend a day at the beach.
       </p>

        The awards saw Warriewood Surf Life Saving Club secure Club of the Year this year—an honour which recognises the commitment of the club to its members and the wider community. I congratulate all the winners and wish them all the best as they progress to the Surf Life Saving New South Wales Awards of Excellence to go up against other branches in the state. I particularly want to recognise their efforts during the lockdown to ensure that our community stayed together. Indeed, when the northern beaches were locked down over Christmas and new year—a matter that was bemoaned by so many others—there were members of my community who saw it as an opportunity to make sure that the beaches remain the way they should be for locals and surf lifesaving. But, when we reopened to the rest of the world, surf lifesavers were there on that weekend and every weekend subsequently to make sure that our beaches were kept clean and were kept safe for anyone from anywhere who wanted to enjoy our beaches—the beaches that Australia is so lucky to have.
