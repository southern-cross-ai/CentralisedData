       <p>
        I am very pleased today to acknowledge the enormous contribution of Jim Pasinis as chief executive of Banyule Community Health. This month Jim has stepped down from his role as chief executive officer, a position he has held for the last 26 years. Jim has led the extraordinary growth of Banyule Community Health, an incredible community health organisation that has been at the heart of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Heidelberg" rel="nofollow">
         West Heidelberg
        </a>
        for more than 40 years. It is one of the original Whitlam community health centres. It is a very lively community centre, where everyone knows that they can get the health and social services that they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Jim's leadership, Banyule Community Health has been completely rebuilt into its fantastic modern home in Alamein Road. This simply would not have been possible without Jim's commitment, dedication and hard work. In 2016, Jim was awarded Banyule Citizen of the Year in recognition of his commitment to social justice. West Heidelberg will miss him. I will miss him. Yes, we will miss his quirky sense of humour but, above all, we will miss his compassion, his commitment to social justice and his strong leadership. Thank you, Jim.
