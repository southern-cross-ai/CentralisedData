        Mr Speaker, on indulgence, if I may, I am sorry you did not see me stand when we were speaking to the condolences of my predecessor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carlton" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Carlton
        </a>
        . I did wish to speak about my friend and colleague, but I noticed that the motion was adjourned and you apparently did not see me rise. I note it has been adjourned to the Federation Chamber—and I will take that opportunity, if that is the will, to speak then—but I would not want anyone to think that I did not rise to speak of Jim Carlton, my predecessor and friend.

         I thank the member for Mackellar. As she rightly points out, the motion has been forwarded to the Federation Chamber. I am very happy for the member for Mackellar to speak on indulgence now, as she represents the seat that Mr Carlton represented for so many years. I call the member for Mackellar.

          Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. It is an emotional speech because

          and I had known each other a long, long time—ever since he became the general secretary of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">

          ,

          division, following Sir John Carrick going into the Senate. We became friends and colleagues. We had many thoughts which were similar.
         </p>
         <p>
          He was all the things that the Prime Minister said about him: an outstanding mind and thinker, dedicated to the concept of what was known then as 'dry' economics—the 'dry' side of politics. But he was more than that. He was a person who cared passionately about other people. His connection into
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
           Papua New Guinea
          </a>
          was well known to those of us who were close to him, and his care for those people as well. When he went to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
           Red Cross
          </a>
          it was almost like a natural progression because it was, again, caring about people. But his was a sound head—one that had learned the skills well in McKinsey. He brought those principles into play in the New South Wales division and he gave a leadership that was different from his predecessor but still carried on the heritage and tradition which Sir John had established.
         </p>

          In his marriage to Di and with his gorgeous kids, he was a family man who, at every time, would be there for his family. Di was vivacious; she was loved in the electorate. She did many things that people still remember her for now, and Jim, of course, was a fine representative, following the Hon. Billy Wentworth, who was the first member for one of the seats which was known as a '49er seat', having been created in 1949. It has only had three members, and I am the third and followed Jim into that seat, where I like to think I have upheld the things that he did and have gone into the community and upheld things of which he approved.
         </p>
         <p>
          We remained friends and we remained in touch with each other, and when I spoke with Di after his passing it was with that sense of joy of the family having been all together on that night. Di said that the last thing he said to her was, 'Don't forget to pick up the roast.' You see, he was always someone who was very connected into that family, and, of course, the thought that he was a donor was very much on their minds when he left the home in Avoca to go to the hospital.
         </p>
         <p>
          His memorial service was a joyous one. There was much to celebrate about him, and all the people who took part spoke of him with an insight and a joy of having known him and of his being someone who had enriched their lives because they knew him. So afterwards, with a cup of tea or a glass of wine—whatever it was—everyone was swapping stories about the contribution that this man had made for his country, and there is nothing that one can do that is more important than what he so thoroughly believed in, which was to do something for his country. He was at one stage a shadow Treasurer, and he would have made a fine Treasurer. He did not have that opportunity, but the service that he did give as Minister for Health was important, even though it was not a long period in that ministry.
         </p>
         <p>
          Jim has made a huge and lasting impression and left a wondrous legacy for this nation. I am the richer for having known him, enjoyed his friendship and having been able to acknowledge what I believe he has given to his country.
