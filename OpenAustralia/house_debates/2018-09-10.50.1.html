        What a two weeks it has been! Our new Prime Minister has donned an Australian flag pin to remind him of who he represents. He may do that because, since he has become our Prime Minister, it's clear that he needs constant reminding about who he represents. We've had him asking for a rev up for the boys in his team. He has called unionist thugs. He has talked about gender whispering in school. He has killed the

        . He has defended the indefensible: bullying in his own team. He has defended European au pairs coming into this country under dubious circumstances.
