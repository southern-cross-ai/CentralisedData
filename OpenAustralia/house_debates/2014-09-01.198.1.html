       <p>
        Recently, my office was advised by none other than the Hon. Christopher Pyne MP, Minister for Education, that Bryce Lee-Bennett, a school lad from my electorate, is a more recent recipient of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Student_Prize" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Student Prize
        </a>
        . Bryce has picked up a certificate. The correspondence also says that he is the recipient of $2,000 in prize money. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate the outstanding local person, recently announced as the recipient of the Australian Student Prize. The prize is a prestigious award giving recognition for exceptional academic achievements over the course of 2014. It is an aware given to only 500 students across the country, and winners represent fewer than 0.5 per cent of the total year 12 population, making the recipients of this aware truly the best and brightest of our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an honour to be able to acknowledge Bryce Lee-Bennett from Greenbank, who attends
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretton_State_College" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . He has demonstrated hard work, dedication and focus in his academic studies, and he is now reaping the rewards.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not subscribe to the fact that every child should win a prize. I subscribe to the fact that hard work brings rewards. With that I would like to acknowledge a well-done job and good luck for the future. I am confident that young Bryce, no matter which route he takes after school, will be fulfilled either in a financial respect or in some other way. He is a great lad and he will go a long way.
