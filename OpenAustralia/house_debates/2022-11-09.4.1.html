        —Proposed fit-out of new leased premises at 6 Parramatta Square.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Taxation Office is proposing fit-out works for its new office at 6 Parramatta Square, Parramatta, Sydney. The proposed works will facilitate the Australian Taxation Office's relocation from its existing office at 2-12

         Macquarie Street
        </a>
        , Parramatta, Sydney, following lease expiry in June 2023. The fit-out will support a flexible working environment and reduce property operating costs while meeting occupational density targets. The estimated cost of the works is $64.4 million excluding

         GST
        </a>
        . Subject to parliamentary approval, the works will commence shortly thereafter and are expected to be completed by April 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works on 3 August 2022. Following its inquiry, the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 that it is expedient to carry out the works. On behalf of the government, I'd like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry, and I commend the motion to the House.
