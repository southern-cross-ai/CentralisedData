        (1) recognises that the number of drownings in Australia increased from 267 deaths in 2014-15 to 280 in 2015-16 as stated in the Royal Life Saving's National Drowning Report (September 2016), which shows:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) a quarter of all drownings occurred in inland waterways such as rivers, creeks and dams;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) almost one fifth of all deaths occurred in people age 25 to 35 years old;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) 86 per cent of all drowning deaths were males; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) there was a 30 per cent decrease in deaths of people age 0 to 4 years old;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that every incidence of drowning has a wider impact including family, rescuers and communities;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that the Government released the Australian Water Safety Strategy in April 2016, which aims to reduce drowning deaths by 50 per cent by 2020;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) acknowledges that the Government is partnering with the peak water safety bodies such as Royal Life Saving (

        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government is short changing Australian pensioners;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) despite interest rates falling from 2.25 per cent in February 2015 to 1.50 per cent today, the Government has failed to adjust deeming rates for Australian pensioners;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) currently a single pensioner's savings are deemed at 1.75 per cent on the first $49,200 and any amount over that is deemed at 3.25 per cent;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) deeming rates are supposed to reflect returns across a range of investment choices available in the market, but the Government is failing to act by lowering deeming rates; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) Australian part-pensioners are doing it tough in a low interest rate environment and pensioners are crying out for some relief; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) calls on the Prime Minister to immediately reduce deeming rates in line with falling interest rates, so that pensioners' assets are deemed fairly and Australian pensioners finally get some relief.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) having safe and affordable housing is a basic human right and the absence of which has a huge human, social and economic cost;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) housing stress and homelessness are serious issues in Australia—first-home buyers are having difficulty entering the market, rental affordability in cities is at a crisis point, waiting lists for social housing continue to grow, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are disproportionately represented in homelessness and housing stress and there are rising levels of homelessness with 105,000 people designated as homeless on any given night; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) there are often complex social, financial and medical issues that cause housing stress and homelessness that are beyond an individual's direct control; and
       </p>

        (2) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) appoint a Minister for

        and Homelessness to provide the necessary focus and leadership required to address the housing issues being experienced in Australia; and

       <p class="italic">
        (b) develop and implement a national housing strategy to ensure a sufficient, modern and equitable housing system for all Australians.

       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) more than $800 million was lost by Australians on legal sports betting in 2014-15, an increase of more than 30 per cent from 2013-14;

       <p class="italic">
        (b) while some restrictions on gambling advertising exist, there is an exemption that allows gambling advertising during televised sporting events at children's viewing times; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) research shows that children are especially susceptible to such advertising;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises the pressing need to act to reduce the level of gambling advertising, particularly during children's viewing times;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to amend the
        <i>
         Broadcasting Services Act 1992
        </i>
        to ban gambling advertising during sporting broadcasts; and
