        I would like to use this opportunity today to inform the House about an issue which has been raised with me by several of my constituents, which is the increased costs faced by mail contractors, particularly those living in rural areas like my electorate of Parkes. The local mail contractor plays an important role in many local communities, particularly in remote rural towns. I have many small towns and villages in my electorate where the residents live long distances from their nearest post office and must rely on the services of their local mail contractor. I know from my own personal experience growing up in a rural area how important the local mail contractor can be. Indeed, except for the last two years, I have been served by mail contractors all my life. In the last place we lived we were 50 kilometres from the post office and the local mail contractor was a lifeline for my family.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that the mail is a critical service for all Australians, and this is especially true for those of us living in rural and remote areas. Unfortunately, like many Australians, local mail contractors in my electorate are being hit hard by rising fuel costs. This increase in fuel costs is putting many mail-contracting businesses in the Parkes electorate under enormous financial pressure. The increase in fuel costs also means that many of my constituents who live on rural properties are having to limit their trips into their nearest service town because it simply costs them too much. As such, they are relying on their local contractors to bring them more than just mail. Often the local contractor will be the only way they can get essentials, such as groceries and spare parts for the machinery.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had several mail contractors in my electorate contact me in relation to this issue, and many have expressed to me their fears that escalating fuel prices are threatening the continuation of their services to people living in their local area. Indeed, it is important to note that most of the contracts are five-year contracts, so the price of fuel doubling in the last two years has severely impacted on a lot of the contractors. I have also met representatives from the local Post Office Agents association and they have raised with me some of their concerns, which are similar to those of my constituents. There is a very real chance that, without some intervention, there will be no mail services in some areas of Australia in the very near future. To leave any rural Australians without access to mail services would be a disaster. I believe it is extremely important that, as federal representatives, we do all we can to assist our local mail contractors so that they can stay afloat and continue to provide this essential service.
       </p>
       <p>
        The mail contractors from Parkes electorate who have contacted me in relation to this issue have asked that the government consider extending the fuel tax credit scheme, and I strongly believe that this is something that needs to be considered. Another option may be to implement a simplified tax scheme or excise relief for mail contractors so that they can continue to keep their businesses in operation. Mail contractors must be given some assistance in order to meet their day-to-day fuel costs. I call on the government to act now to provide some financial relief to mail contractors, particularly those living in rural and regional areas. We need to ensure that this vital service is not lost.
