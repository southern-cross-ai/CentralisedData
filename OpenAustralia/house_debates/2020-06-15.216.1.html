         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        list for 2020, where 933 Australians were recognised for their contribution to their communities. I'm pleased to report that seven constituents in my electorate were listed. I extend my congratulations to the five recipients of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        ; Ms Helen McIntyre was recognised for her longstanding role as secretary of the Donkey Society of Western Australia; and, finally, Mr Noel Nancarrow was recognised for his long-time service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Murray
        </a>
        in various local government roles. Two of my constituents were also listed for meritorious awards: Mr Peter Sutton of Byford received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fire_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Fire Service Medal
        </a>
        for his exemplary commitments to the WA Department of Fire and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Emergency Services
        </a>
        and to the community of Western Australia throughout his 25-year career; and Mr Danny Goodlad of Mandurah received the Emergency Services Medal in recognition of his service in Marine Rescue WA for nearly two decades. Mr Goodlad's commitment to marine safety in WA is highly valued. I'm honoured to represent these recipients and encourage them and the wider community to continue in this good work.
