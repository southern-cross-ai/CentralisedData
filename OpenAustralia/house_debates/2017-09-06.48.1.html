        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">

         I thank the honourable member for his question. He, like all members of the government, is focused on the issues that are of most concern to Australians: energy prices, economic growth, jobs and, above all, national security. There is no greater risk to the security of our region than the threat posed by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         today.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can inform the House that I discussed the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean" rel="nofollow">
          North Korean
         </a>
         threat and other security issues with President Trump this morning. The risk of war on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
          Korean Peninsula
         </a>
         is, as we noted, greater than it has been for 60 years. Conflict on the peninsula would be catastrophic. President Trump and I agreed that now is the time to exert the maximum diplomatic and, above all, economic pressure on North Korea to bring this reckless and dangerous regime to its senses. The North Korean regime is threatening the peace of the region in a manner that runs the risk of disturbing the world order, putting thousands of millions of lives at risk. It is the most dangerous, immediate threat to the stability of our region and we need more concerted effort by the global community.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've also discussed this threat with President Widodo of Indonesia yesterday, with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and with Prime Minister English of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         last week. All the leaders with whom I have discussed this recognise that this threat needs to be addressed. We all recognise that China has the closest and most substantial economic relationship with North Korea. Nobody suggests that China is responsible for North Korea's dangerous conduct; nobody suggests that North Korea is to China what
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany" rel="nofollow">
          East Germany
         </a>
         was to the old
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Soviet Union
         </a>
         . We recognise that China is enforcing the latest round of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Security Council
         </a>
         sanctions. We acknowledge that and we thank them for doing that. But the reality is that China alone has the economic leverage that would enable it to bring this regime to its senses without conflict. With the greatest leverage comes the greatest responsibility. We are thoroughly united in calling on China to do more in concert with the global community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Above all, President Trump and I confirmed and affirmed the alliance between our two nations, the bedrock of our national security. We have America's back; America has Australia's back. We are united.

         <p>
          On indulgence, I would like to briefly associate the opposition with the Prime Minister's remarks. The message from both sides of this parliament is unequivocal.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
           North Korea
          </a>
          's repeated defiance of international law and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
           UN
          </a>
          Security Council resolutions is unacceptable. North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear tests are not only a direct threat to its immediate neighbours, but they undermine global peace and security. No nation can believe itself immune from the threat that this crisis poses. Every nation must do all that it can to pressure North Korea to halt this extremely dangerous conduct.
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Wong and I will be travelling to Japan and the Republic of Korea later this month. Our message to Australia's friends and partners in the region will be crystal clear. Every member of the Australian parliament wants a stable, secure and peaceful region, and we will support every practical step that can be taken to reduce the risk of conflict. Whatever Labor can do to assist in this endeavour, we will.
