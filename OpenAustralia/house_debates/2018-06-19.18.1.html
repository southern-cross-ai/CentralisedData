       <p>
        In a week where Eurydice Dixon's tragic death has united the country in grief and outrage, I would like to speak about a tragedy no less heart-wrenching that happened on the borders of my electorate last week. Justin was a five-year-old boy who lived in Carlingford and attended Carlingford Public School in my electorate. Last week his life was cut short when he was stabbed and killed by his father. By all accounts, the father loved his son deeply and had been trying to get into mental health facilities in the days prior to the attack but was turned away. I'm sure the House will join me in sharing our deepest sorrow for the boy's family, including his distraught mother and his grandmother, who found him and nursed him as they tried to take him to hospital. This is a tragedy that should never have happened and will leave a permanent mark on this family.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this awful time, the local community has banded together, led by Carlingford Public School Principal Neil Hinton, who has been coordinating the tributes. A GoFundMe page has been set up by local families to help the boy's mother meet the costs of the funeral, which will be held this week. If you too have been moved by this awful situation and would like to donate, please contact my office on (02)98694288 to get the details of this page. Thank you.
