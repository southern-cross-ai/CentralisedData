       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute and express my condolences on the death of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Richardson" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Richardson
        </a>
        , who served as a director in the United Workers Union and as assistant national secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union" rel="nofollow">
         National Union
        </a>
        of Workers. I worked with Paul and admired him. I admired Paul's commitment to the labour movement, his fierce intellect, his gruffness, his generosity and his terrific sense of humour. I admired the way Paul demonstrated discipline and professionalism but also fostered a sense of fun and family in the union. Paul's sharp mind and his incredible, phenomenal attention to detail were practically superhuman, and his powerful skills made him an outstanding advocate for workers, as well as a very important addition to the Victorian Labor Party's rules committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul loved his wife, Susie, and daughter, Katya, and my sympathies are with them, his family, his friends and the many union members and colleagues who knew him. Paul's funeral was standing room only, with mourners spilling out of the chapel. He was so loved, respected and admired, and he will be very sorely missed. Thank you, Paul, for you did for working people in this country. You will be missed, and you will be remembered.
