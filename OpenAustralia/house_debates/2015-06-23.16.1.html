        It is great to follow the member for Indi, who talked about the next generation of Australians and protecting our environment, because over the last few weeks I have had a great opportunity to visit several
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Green Army
        </a>
        initiatives across my local region. These Green Army initiatives are great. They are giving the next generation of locals an opportunity not only to participate in practical environmental work but to meet people in the workforce, to put things with great meaning on their

        and ultimately to help them find employment in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are a number of these great initiatives across my electorate. The first one I visited was at Burpengary. We were cleaning the area around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burpengary_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Burpengary Creek
        </a>
        . We were repairing the riparian vegetation. This will make a real difference to this stunning natural asset that we have in Burpengary. The second one was at Neurum. Again riparian vegetation was being protected and cleaned up across the beautiful creek system there. That was a great practical initiative for our environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to say how proud I am of the young locals involved in these Green Army initiatives. They were dedicated and determined. They were making a real difference to their community and really increasing their prospects of future employment. I think any employer would be lucky to have them.
