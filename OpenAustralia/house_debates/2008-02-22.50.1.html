        I grieve for the people in my electorate because of the 150 jobs that have gone as a result of the failure of the government to proceed with the Centrelink call centre. This government alleges that it is concerned for the people of Australia. This government alleges that it is concerned to create opportunities. But in fact what we have is a regional area with high unemployment, with great need, and the government has curtailed a project that was going to create great benefits. It was going to create great benefits not only for the people who received those jobs but for Centrelink customers. We all want to provide better services for the customers of Centrelink. How can failing to upgrade our call centres provide better services from Centrelink for the people who need them?
       </p>
       <p>
        It is pure hypocrisy of the people on the other side to say that they claim to care for the people who use Centrelink services but at the same time fail to proceed with an important upgrade. They fail to allow jobs to be created in regional areas through an upgrade of our call centre services which would provide faster, more efficient services. We hear all the time in our electorates that people want better services from Centrelink, and the previous government was committed to delivering those. But in the government’s first action, when their backsides are barely on the treasury benches, they cut services to Centrelink. They cut the ability of Centrelink to provide for the people whom it is supposed to look after. It is an absolute disgrace. I cannot believe this, particularly from the new members opposite. How does the member for Bass feel when she comes into this place and the first action is to deliver the loss of jobs in her electorate?

          She is not even here. I can see her newsletter now: ‘150 Jobs Slashed from Bass’. Hear, hear! I see the members opposite cheering about 150 jobs lost in Bass as well as 150 jobs lost in my electorate. It is a disgrace.

          The expansion of call centres in regional areas makes sense for a range of reasons. It makes good economic sense as well as good service delivery sense. We have in regional areas a supply of labour available to do a range of tasks, but currently, in many cases, people are underemployed. A call centre would draw on what is perhaps currently an underutilised labour force. But what is this government doing? It is not creating opportunities in regional areas. It is not looking to improve the unemployment situation in regional areas. What it is doing is ripping jobs out of regional Australia. The member for Bass did not bother to front on the

             Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, the Prime Minister is today visiting Indigenous communities in Walgett and then visiting flood victims in Mackay. That is what the Prime Minister is doing today. This is an extraordinary breach of the protocols of this House that the member here is continuing with. Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask that you take action on this disorderly conduct.

Not once was that questioned—not once. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to show leadership—
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The Leader of the House will resume his seat.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Madam Deputy Speaker, if we can return to the matter that you were previously dealing with and where you indicated that you would give me the call, the point of order I was raising is that no motion of the House has been carried and, on that ground, you cannot ask the member for Cowper to remove himself.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The member for Warringah will resume his seat. As was discussed earlier today, you may not be happy with the new standing orders, but they were put in place prior to coming into the House today. I am operating under the standing orders as they apply today.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Madam Deputy Speaker, on the point of order that was raised by the member for Warringah, he was, I assume, referring to the naming and the suspension for 24 hours that would follow. Prior to that event, you had quite properly in accordance with standing order 94(a) requested the member for Cowper to leave the chamber. Standing order 94(a), in part, reads:
                                              </p>
                                              <p class="italic">
                                               The direction shall not be open to debate or dissent, and if the Member does not leave the Chamber immediately, the Speaker can name the Member under the following procedure.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The following procedure was the subject of the division. The prior requirement under standing order 94(a) for the member for Cowper to remove himself for one hour is not open to debate. Everyone in this chamber knows that, and it has been obeyed without exception by anybody from the time it was inserted under former Speaker Martin. I would therefore suggest that the member for Cowper should remove himself for the hour, as has been the practice ever since that standing order was put in place—without exception.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Madam Deputy Speaker, the member was named. You asked for a vote. The vote on the voices was challenged. A division was called for. No division was held. Therefore, no decision of this chamber has been made and the member has a right to be heard. If the government does not have the numbers on the floor of the chamber, it should give it to someone else.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The member for
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

                                               will resume his seat. The member for Cowper will remove himself from the chamber. The member for Cowper’s refusal to leave the chamber places the chair in an untenable position. The sitting is suspended until the ringing of the bells.

                                               Order! Today’s events have been of considerable concern to me. I repeat my earlier statement that I understand that some members have concerns about the arrangements for Friday sittings. I wish to express my full confidence in the work of all occupants of the chair today in what have been difficult circumstances. If our House is to expect the community to have confidence in it, all members should conduct themselves with decorum and dignity regardless of their views about particular matters, including the conduct of business on future Fridays. The time for the grievance debate has expired. The debate is interrupted and I put the question:
                                              </p>
                                              <p class="moved">
                                               That grievances be noted.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Question agreed to.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Earlier today the member for Herbert drew the attention of the Speaker to the state of the House. In accordance with standing order 55(c) I will count the House if the member so desires. I ask the member for Herbert to indicate if he requires a count of the House to be taken.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Mr Speaker, my request was before lunch. I require this parliament to operate properly. I require a count of the House.
