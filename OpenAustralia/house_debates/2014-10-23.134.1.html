        Today I rise to talk about the disgraceful impacts of the Abbott government's budget, which will have impacts in communities in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">

        , the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling reported on the yearly hip-pocket impact on families in our local area by this budget. I would like to list just how much families in each of our communities will be out of pocket because of this cruel and heartless budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        People in Craigieburn will be out of pocket by $823 per annum; in Sunbury South by $614; in Wallan by $600; in Sunbury by $534; in Whittlesea by $525; in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Morang" rel="nofollow">
         South Morang
        </a>
        by $508; and in Kilmore-Broadford by $481. People in Romsey will be affected by $410, the people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         St Andrews
        </a>
        by $348 and the people of Gisborne by $329. Compare those figures with those of the electorates of Mr Abbott and senior ministers
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Hockey
        </a>
        and Mr Turnbull, which engulf some of the wealthiest suburbs in Australia. Yet they will be the least affected by this budget. I think that last point bears repeating—the wealthiest suburbs in Australia will be the least affected by this budget. For example, in the electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        the average household will be out of pocket by $155. In Mr Turnbull's electorate of Wentworth it ranges from $118 up to $170, and in Mr Abbott's own electorate of Warringah the out-of-pocket figure is a measly $125. Even those opposite should be capable enough to see the stark inequity in that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        tax on the sick, perhaps they should cut the tax break for superannuation accounts with over $2 million in them. Instead of cutting $5.8 billion out of universities, perhaps there should be a bigger crackdown on multinational tax avoidance. Treasurer Hockey said this budget was to even out the lifters and leaners in this country, ensuring that everyone partakes of their share of the heavy lifting. But I think the NATSEM report clearly shows who is doing the heavy lifting—it is the least well-off Australians, while the richest Australians barely bat an eyelid. This budget is putting more pressure on pensioners, more pressure on low- and middle-income families and more pressure on our young people. The report takes into account the specific budget measures such as cuts to pensions, family payments and youth allowance. It takes into account the Abbott government's removal of the schoolkids bonus and important supplements for those struggling to make ends meet. These factors alone have led to the estimated out-of-pocket amounts that I mentioned before. What this does not take into account is the impact of the GP tax, the impact of the petrol tax and the impact of the $80 billion cuts to health and education.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we have is individuals in communities in McEwen having up to $823 less in their pockets because of this callous budget, and also facing the additional burden of having to pay $7 each time they go to the doctor. People in regional areas have the additional burden of paying more at the bowser as punishment for where they live—even the now Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged that. What we have learned from the Deputy Prime Minister's words is that the Nationals are all yappy when they are in opposition but are quiet as church mice when they get into government. Parents have the additional burden of wondering whether their children will have the same access to education as those in more wealthy suburbs. Students have the additional burden of forking out up to $100,000 for their tertiary education. Carers have the additional burden of worrying if their loved ones will still be cared for now that important supplements like the dementia supplement have been scrapped.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is insulting for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to be spruiking this budget as an egalitarian way to share the heavy lifting of this country. The callous budget is putting the entire burden on low- and middle-income families—students, pensioners—while their millionaire financers are not being touched. It says everything about the Liberal Party's twisted priorities. It shows how out of touch the Liberals are when it comes to Australian families. It is a disgraceful, iniquitous budget that is just another example of this government being driven by their tea party ideologies—only looking after their mates and completely shafting real and hardworking Australians. I and Labor will continue to fight this cruel and heartless budget. We have fought these measures tooth and nail, which is why the government had to withdraw and split the bills tabled in the parliament. But of course—as is typical of this arrogant government—they shut down the debate and ran the bills through right at the end of sitting. We will continue this fight because the people of McEwen deserve better than a cruel and heartless Liberal Party.
