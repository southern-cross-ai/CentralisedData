        The federal government is investing in healthier, more productive soils to help achieve the agriculture sector's quest for $100 billion by 2030. Grant guidelines for the second phase of the $50 million National Soil Carbon Innovation Challenge have been released. Applications are open until 3 March. The grant opportunity gives research and commercialisation organisations up to $20 million to develop lower cost, accurate technological solutions for measuring soil organic carbon stocks and so much more.

        As co-chair, with the member for Barton, of the Parliamentary Friends of Soil group, I appreciate the importance of identifying and addressing issues relating to the health and maintenance of Australia's soils. Recently, with the member for Hume and Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, I visited YLAD Living Soils, in Hilltops shire. He used to represent it; I do now. It was an important meeting. Certainly, Bill and Rhonda Daly, who operate that farm—a farm that has been operated by Bill and his family for four generations—are working wonders with soil health. They're cutting costs with every method, absolutely lowering synthetic fertilisers, chemicals and pesticides and making the most of their soil. They're saving money because of it. They're making their farm more profitable, and that's what it's all about. They are doing what all farmers should be doing, and that is looking after your soil.
