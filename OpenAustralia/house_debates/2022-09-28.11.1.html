        (—) (): I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maintaining Australia's strong biosecurity status ensures our food security and protects agricultural trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        This can only be achieved through a strong government-industry partnership.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the many ways this partnership takes effect is through the work of Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through these bodies, the Australian government partners with state and territory governments and a number of livestock and plant industry bodies to further our shared biosecurity interests and ensure Australia's world class produce remains in high demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Incursions of exotic animal diseases or plant pests into Australia are relatively rare, but they do have serious potential impacts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Detection of foot-and-mouth disease and lumpy skin disease in one of our nearest neighbouring nations has had the government and livestock industries on high alert.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has taken immediate action to prevent these diseases from entering Australia, implementing the strongest biosecurity response in our nation's history.
       </p>
       <p>
        This includes our three-pronged approach of supporting Indonesia's response to both diseases with animal vaccinations and technical support, stronger measures at the border and increased preparedness here at home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the risk of incursion cannot be entirely mitigated.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why governments and industry bodies partner as signatories to the Emergency Animal Disease Response Agreement and Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the worst should happen and an exotic animal disease or plant pest should make its way into Australia, emergency eradication responses are mounted and cost-shared under these deeds to give the best possible chance of eradication.
       </p>
       <p>
        Government and industry investment can avoid significant pest or disease management cost to our producers in the longer term.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past few years, under these emergency response arrangements, we've been able to eradicate citrus canker and three strains of avian influenza.
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Varroa jacobsoni
        </i>
        a bee parasite—which we all know as varroa mite, was also eradicated and we are now working to achieve the same outcome for its more problematic cousin,
        <i>
         Varroa destructor
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Four kinds of biosecurity levies provide an equitable way for all producers to contribute to the cost of the biosecurity activities and eradication responses that benefit their industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia levies fund activities such as biosecurity education, planning and surveillance, as well as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHA" rel="nofollow">
         AHA
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHA" rel="nofollow">
         PHA
        </a>
        membership.
       </p>
       <p>
        Emergency animal disease response and emergency plant pest response levies primarily fund industry contributions to eradication responses.
       </p>
       <p>
        They can also be spent on other biosecurity activities once these financial obligations are met.
       </p>
       <p>
        An issue for Plant Health Australia member industries is that for the EPPR levy this alternative use is limited to purposes related to emergency plant pests under the plant response deed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Increasing the flexibility in how these levies can be spent to include all plant health and biosecurity activities will increase their effectiveness.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will achieve this by broadening the range of permissible uses for those levies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Plant industries have welcomed this change, as it will allow them to focus available funds on their industry's most pressing biosecurity needs, whether for exotic or established plant pests.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, meeting response costs remains crucial—it is the main purpose for emergency response levies—and the bill will not change that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also modernise and streamline the AHA and PHA funding legislation, including by removing redundant or duplicative provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, a complex provision for funding biosecurity related research and development activities through PHA levies will be removed in favour of using PHA's more straightforward industry planning processes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also simplify the process by which the relevant PHA industry member for a specific biosecurity levy is determined.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will reduce regulatory and administrative burden.
       </p>
       <p>
        Honey bees provide valuable pollination services to a myriad of plant industries and the honey industry's biosecurity activities are now characterised as plant biosecurity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Therefore, references to honey in the AHA act can now be removed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also allow the AHA act to facilitate the levy arrangements that are likely to be needed if other response deeds are agreed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of these changes will make the AHA and PHA funding legislation more effective, efficient and fit for purpose.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will strengthen the ability of industries to invest meaningfully in biosecurity and help maintain Australia's enviable position as a world-class agricultural producer and exporter.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
