        As the 2015 school year comes to a close and all are looking forward to a well-earned break, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous work of teachers, principals, governing councils, students, parents, volunteers and the school community generally. As I have stated in this place on a number of occasions, education is a passion of mine, and Hindmarsh is home to a number of great schools doing some great things. At every opportunity I enjoy visiting schools, where I meet the many committed teachers and principals and appreciate speaking with students of all ages. I have greatly valued attending recent end-of-year award presentation ceremonies and valedictories, where I have heard some amazing stories of students' excellence and talents in academics, sport, music and broader school involvement. I have been very impressed with the achievements of all award winners across the electorate, and I congratulate all recipients.

        In 2014 I introduced the Hindmarsh Shield Award to recognise and celebrate those who go above and beyond in their contribution to their school. The Hindmarsh Shield Award is presented in the spirit of Sir John Hindmarsh, who the electorate was named after and who was the

        from 1836 to 1838. The award acknowledges the valuable contribution of a student, recognising excellence in their studies, in leadership, in community service, in the sporting or musical domain, or in entrepreneurship. I take this opportunity to mention of the 2015 Hindmarsh Shield recipients thus far: from

        I would like to make special mention of Adriano Ricchetti. Through his five years at Nazareth Catholic College, Adriano has displayed a maturity well beyond his years. As well as being a full-time student with pleasing academic results across a wide range of subjects, Adriano has been regularly involved in the college's extracurricular activities, most notably soccer. Beyond the school arena, Adriano has also taken on a great deal of responsibility given his family's unique circumstances. Both of Adriano's parents are hearing impaired and consequently have some difficulty communicating with others. As well as this, Adriano's father has had to deal with a serious medical issue for a number of years. Being the responsible person he is, Adriano often spent time away from both school and his friends to help his parents communicate with medical professionals and to remain with his family during these trying times. This selflessness and care for others above himself exemplifies his character and is something he can certainly be proud of. I said hello to him and his family briefly last week at the

        presentation, where they had over 1,000 people. It was a fine event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate all year 12 students in Hindmarsh on their 13 years of education and wish them the best of luck in whatever their endeavours may be.
