       <p>
        I rise to commend the fantastic fundraising efforts of the Greenway community in supporting the Cancer Council's Biggest Morning Tea this year and to acknowledge the 20th anniversary of such a great initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 19 May I had the pleasure of attending
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Langley" rel="nofollow">
         Kings Langley
        </a>
        Adventist Aged Care for their annual Biggest Morning Tea event. A big thank you must go to Julie Summers and Christine Khan and all their team for their efforts in putting together such a great day and for raising vital funds for the Cancer Council. The Kings Langley Lions Club must also be commended for their great work in helping organise the event and generally for the selfless work they do in the Kings Langley area.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 23 May I also joined the Lalor Park Community Garden's Biggest Morning Tea at the Lalor Park Community Centre with members of the local community. It was great to see so many residents in attendance, despite the inclement weather. And a big thank you must go to Lalor Park Community Garden's public officer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Lewis" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , for organising such a successful event and also to the CommonGroundz Cafe and its manager, Nathan Marshall, for providing the excellent coffee on the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        And this Thursday the
        <i>
         Blacktown Advocate
        </i>
        will be hosting its annual Biggest Morning Tea event. I am sorry I will not be able to attend. However, a big thank you must go to its editor and my constituent, Joanne Vella, for her commitment to another great event. I had the pleasure of joining this event last year where I was the successful bidder at its auction. I am sure this week's event will be even bigger and better than ever.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the Greenway electorate many organisations and individuals have chipped in for the Biggest Morning Tea over the past 20 years. I want to praise them all for their efforts and generosity.
