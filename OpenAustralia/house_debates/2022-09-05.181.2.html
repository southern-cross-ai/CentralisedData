       <p>
        Earlier this year I was able to visit an excellent education and training institution in my electorate of Robertson,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ET" rel="nofollow">
         ET
        </a>
        Australia. ET Australia is an adult training college and an independent years-7-to-12 secondary college that provides students with the skills to be successful in employment and/or further studies, along with delivering customised training and free recruitment services to businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        ET Australia hosted its first combined school assembly since COVID-19, and the focus of this assembly was recognising
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Week 2022. It was an absolute privilege to be invited to speak at this assembly and provide the students with insight into my time as an emergency doctor working at both Gosford and Wyong hospitals, but also into my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        background. The students were keen to share with me their thoughts on how the new federal government can make Australia a more inclusive and equal country for all Australians. They were very interested in letting me know what they would like to see on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This was one of the first events that I've attended since becoming the member for Robertson, and I enjoyed the opportunity to also listen and to answer questions that the students had for me. I would like to thank the principal, Tony Mylan; the executive assistant, Jessica; and all the staff and students at ET Australia for the warm welcome and for organising such a beautiful assembly. And remember: be brave and make change.
