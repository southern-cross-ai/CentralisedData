        There are around 2.5 million businesses in Australia. Roughly two per cent of those 2.5 million businesses export their products and services overseas. Today I would like to showcase two of those businesses exporting to the world from my electorate on the

        Lowes TC, from their base in

        , cultivate between 80,000 and 100,000 premium plant stocks every week all year round for export across the world. This business began 36 years ago and established on the Central Coast in 1995. The vision of owner Greg Lowes has seen the business expand to facilities in India and Ireland and, this year, supply over 3.5 million live plants. They stock over 1,200 plant varieties, have developed their own logistics software and play an active role in biosecurity through their plant bank of maintenance clones. With food production expected to increase by 50 per cent by 2050, this is a Central Coast company positioned for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lowes TC recently received a $50,000 grant from the Global Connections Fund to help them work with their international partners on their wasabi project, which they're looking to export to the lucrative Japanese market. Did you know that most of the wasabi consumed in Australia is actually horseradish? This may be because wasabi is very picky about where it grows—traditionally, undisturbed in misty mountain stream beds. What Japan and the rest of the world will soon find out is that it thrives at Lowes TC. Despite being told over and over that wasabi cannot be grown successfully in Australia, Lowes TC have done just that. The Japanese consume around 1,750 tonnes of wasabi each year, mostly in restaurants. Lowes TC want to see this become a delicacy enjoyed at home as well, and their innovation grant will help them partner with the University of York in England to produce a wasabi by-product that can be used as a food additive. Innovation and research like this is central to Australia's economic future, which is why Labor is committed to ensuring that three per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        is spent on research and development by the end of the next decade, making us globally competitive and protecting and growing Australian jobs. Lowes TC is a local business achieving outstanding results, and their focus on innovation and research drives their success. Congratulations, Lowes TC, on being an outstanding business and employer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations are also in order for Darkroom Door, an award-winning local business in Berkeley Vale that manufactures and distributes quality art rubber stamps and photographic paper craft products for creative use to more than 18 countries worldwide. Husband and wife duo, Rachel, a professional photographer, and, Stewart, a graphic designer, took an idea they brainstormed in their blue kombi van while travelling through Europe and turned it into a successful export business. Recently, they have secured an American distributor, making further inroads into the competitive
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        market. This year, they are once again nominated for a Premier's NSW Export Award in the creative industries category to be presented in Sydney later this month. This is in addition to other accolades achieved—the Australian Craft Industry Awards, the Hunter Manufacturing Awards, the Central Coast women in arts and culture awards, and the Hunter Central Coast export awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rachel and Stuart have found a niche market and are successful. There is much that government can and should do to support their success—and that of other businesses like theirs. That's why I was pleased to invite the shadow minister for trade and investment, the member for Blaxland, to the Central Coast to visit Darkroom Door last week and showcase one of the great small business success stories of the Central Coast. Labor wants to see more Aussie businesses break into the overseas markets—businesses like Darkroom Door and Lowes TC; businesses that export, make bigger profits and employ more people. It's great for the business, and it's great for our local economy. The Central Coast is a place where business can invest and succeed. Lowes TC and Darkroom Door are proof that our region is a place where innovation can and does thrive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to congratulate the Wyong Regional Chamber of Commerce, which I joined in 2008 as a councillor delegate. The chamber has been supporting local businesses in our region since 1925 and has been named a finalist at the New South Wales Business Chamber Awards. I wish President Ron Stevens, the board and the executive team the best of luck for the award ceremony in November.
