       <p>
        Last Friday, together with our foreign minister, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
         Julie Bishop
        </a>
        , I had the honour of officially opening the Performing Arts Centre at

        . This was a true honour, not simply because this is a fantastic milestone for the school but, importantly, also because Huntingtower is a truly wonderful school—because of the people of Huntingtower—under the superb leadership of the principal, Mr Sholto Bowen. The school board; the school board president, Mr David Weil; students; school architects, Baldasso Cortese; the

        Higgins; and recipients of the Chisholm Volunteer Awards were all present to bear witness to this exciting and momentous time in history for Huntingtower. The music and song achievements were all celebrated as part of the event and the music and song contributions were absolutely brilliant and so enjoyed by all. Congratulations to all, including the students and parents who contributed to this magnificent facility. The event was superbly organised and proceeded with professionalism, pride and joy, thanks to the leadership of all the students.
       </p>

        The students of Huntingtower are so fortunate to have the opportunity to attend a school that provides them with a quality holistic education which embraces the holistic benefits of integrating the arts as part of the school curriculum. Undoubtedly, current and future students—and their families and the broader community of Huntingtower—will make many wonderful memories with theatre, dance, song and music in this magnificent centre.
