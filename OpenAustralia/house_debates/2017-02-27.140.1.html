        The jobs of the 21st century will require study in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, otherwise known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">

        subjects. That is why I have commissioned the inaugural 2017 Bennelong Schools' STEM Challenge, sponsored by Medtronic, as part of the Bennelong Innovation Fair. The winners will get an all-expenses-paid trip to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to show off their good work in the

        . I can report that local schools in Bennelong have jumped at the challenge.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the pleasure of attending Melrose Park Public School last week, a school participating in the STEM challenge, to encourage them and also to see their impressive study programs, which include project based learning. Hosted by principal Clare Kristensen and teachers Jennie Spencley and Pam Grover, I also met their excellent student leaders and year 5-6 science and technology students. Guided by Arjun Bhagotra, Cooper Roche, Ashlyn Gange and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Park" rel="nofollow">

        , I also met fellow students Ryan Slender, Leticia Downes, Jye Davies, Aniela Sheehy, Nadege Cayzac Cruise and Emma Ralla. These extraordinary students are a credit to their school and community. Additionally, I organised for participating STEM-challenge schools to visit the 3M company's innovation centre. 3M have their Australian headquarters in Bennelong and are a ubiquitous global leader in high-tech, high-knowledge consumer applications. They are one of the most innovative companies in Australia, with thousands of inventions and patents to their name.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, among these thousands of ideas, they are perhaps best known for an accidental invention, Post-it Notes. This was a result of a failure in trying to invent an adhesive that was much stronger. Their innovation attitude delivered the bright reminder notes that sometimes litter our desks crying out to be noticed and actioned. Thank you, 3M.

        , Ermington West Public School, Melrose Park Public School and Marsden High School were genuinely dazzled and inspired by what they experienced during their visit. The passion of students accompanying teachers was wonderful to behold. Teachers such as Amy Whitfield,

        , Jaimee Hutchens, Shannan Judge and Mini Matthews are a credible to their schools and their essential profession. Thank you to Balbir Blassey of 3M for hosting the school visit.

        I would like to close with my thanks to Schools STEM Challenge sponsor Medtronic. The diversified medical device manufacturer, led by managing director Jamie Stanistreet, have opened up their hearts and corporate headquarters to our local schools, agreeing to host the final exhibition, where we will judge the winners. This campus styled new head office is perfect for such an occasion.
