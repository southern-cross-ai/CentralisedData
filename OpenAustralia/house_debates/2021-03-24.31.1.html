        Over the past few days, my community on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        has really been greatly affected by the rain and flooding which I know has impacted so many communities right across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        east coast. But this is particularly true in my community for residents who live in Spencer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisemans_Ferry" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Gunderman and other communities along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkesbury_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I am advised by the Department of Communities and Justice that while they're still conducting welfare checks on those further down the river, all appear to be safe and well at this stage. But we know that there remain concerns over the weather over the next 24 hours or so. Local residents have gathered at the Spencer general store, with many calling on neighbours to check they're okay, sharing batteries to charge their phones and ensuring that everyone has access to essential supplies.
       </p>
       <p>
        These communities have been through a lot in recent years, with last summer's bushfires threatening property, heavy rains in early 2020 causing damage and now floods posing a serious threat. I've spoken with a number of locals and volunteers over the past few days, including Alison Wade, Rolf Garda, Alan Pappas, Robyn Downham and Cath Wade. Cath said that locals were remaining resilient. She was confident they could get through this tough time and rebuild, as they've done so many times in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to say a very big thank you to everyone involved, including our amazing

        and local police, who have worked tirelessly to prepare and protect our community. The federal government will continue to do all we can and I would encourage those affected to contact Services Australia on 1802266â€”
