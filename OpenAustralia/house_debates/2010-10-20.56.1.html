       <p>
        I rise to commend the work being done in the Kempsey area in my electorate by the Dunghutti Aboriginal Leadership Management Alliance. The area has a relatively large Indigenous population and, like most of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        , has an unemployment rate above the national average. The alliance has been formed by community leaders, members of youth groups, chief executive officers and chairpersons of Aboriginal organisations throughout the Macleay Valley. This is the first time that the major Aboriginal organisations in Kempsey have come together to present a coordinated front to deal with the longstanding issues affecting their community. Its aim is to reduce the economic and social disadvantage experienced by many in the Indigenous community—in other words, to play its role in Closing the Gap.
       </p>
       <p>
        A comprehensive report has been prepared identifying the current best practice in Indigenous programs and areas of greatest need. On the basis of this report, DALMA will act as a conduit between the Indigenous community and all levels of government on Closing the Gap issues and ensure that programs and services are comprehensive, accessible, flexible and community centred. I particularly welcome the group’s belief that Closing the Gap will only succeed if Aboriginal peoples develop and drive the solutions, the group’s desire for unity in the whole Kempsey community and its recognition of the importance of the natural environment and the need for accountability with regard to taxpayers’ money. I wish DALMA all the best in its very important work.
