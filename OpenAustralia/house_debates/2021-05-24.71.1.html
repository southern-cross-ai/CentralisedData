        My question is to the Prime Minister. This morning Senate estimates was told that, more than two years after the reported sexual assault of Brittany Higgins in this building, there have been no changes in the way this building responds to serious incidents and none of the reviews that the Prime Minister ordered have concluded. Despite everything we've heard from Ms Higgins, how can that be so?

         The member would be aware that, while it is not in the purview of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          President of the Senate
         </a>
         , what was initiated very soon after the reporting of these events was the new counselling service that operates for all members and senators of this place and expanded hours of access to those supports. That was in place, and I'm pleased to report that that service is being well used by staff members of this place, when they need to, and also by members of parliament and others who are seeking support from those services. I'm pleased that's in place; it was put in place very soon after. In addition, I am expecting very, very shortly a report from the deputy secretary, who I understand is very close to finalising her report to me. That matter will then be raised with cabinet, in terms of the recommendations that come forward, and I look forward to engaging with the opposition on the establishment of an independent complaints process. There is some significant work being done by my department, working closely with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
          Sex Discrimination Commissioner
         </a>
         , to ensure that an independent complaints process won't have to wait until the end of this year, when the independent inquiry is completed, but we can get that independent process in place much sooner than that. I look forward to engaging with the opposition on those matters in the very near future.
