        Reid is one of the most multiculturally diverse seats in federal parliament. Fifty-five per cent of the people who live there are born overseas. One of the great communities that calls Reid home is our local Lebanese community. I would like to extend my warmest wishes to the Lebanese community within my electorate, because tomorrow, Friday, 22 November, is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Independence_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Lebanese Independence Day
        </a>
        . In fact, it is the 70th anniversary of that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 2½ thousand of my constituents were born in Lebanon and over 6½ thousand people in Reid have Lebanese ancestry. They have been a marvellous addition to the multicultural landscape that makes up Reid. Part of that wonderful community is my local Maronite community. I would also like to extend a word of congratulations to Bishop Tarabay. On 3 June this year he was made the fourth bishop of the Maronite Diocese of Australia. I also have a strong personal connection with the bishop, because he is my back-fence neighbour. It has been great to have a chat over a cup of coffee with him. The guidance he provides his community is fantastic.
       </p>

        I remember my first introduction to the Maronite community was in fourth class in the local Catholic school. I met Chris Ayoub and asked whether he was Catholic. He said, 'No; I am Maronite.' I asked him what that meant and he said, 'It means I'm more Catholic than you are.' I have a great local parish,

        Croydon. Charlie Sara and all the team there are fantastic to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to record my deepest sympathies. Lebanon, the country of the community's birth, is still a country where at times there are terror attacks. Last week was an occasion on which such a callous event occurred. It was a stark reminder of the need for us all, especially coming to this parliament, to work non-stop to stamp out terror wherever we may see it. To the people of Reid of Lebanese descent I again pass on my best wishes. To those at St Joseph's at Croydon, led by Charlie Sara, I look forward to seeing you again shortly. Happy 70th anniversary for Lebanese Independence Day.
