        It is always a pleasure to rise in this place and talk about our local electorates. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about how Logan police have established a dedicated domestic violence and management team. This team is seeking to take a proactive approach to dealing with high-risk domestic violence matters, and I would like to commend them for their initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2014, Logan police responded to 5300 domestic violence matters. At the moment there are around 177 high-risk couples on the radar across Logan, and we know that this has been a subject of broad discussion across the country.

        This new team of four officers will target perpetrators identified as high-risk offenders. Logan Domestic and

        coordinator, Acting Sergeant Larissa Shaw, is part of the team, and six years ago she left her own domestic violence situation. Sergeant Shaw built herself up mentally and physically after leaving her situation and created a state of emotional wellbeing not only for herself, but for others through some fantastic programs she has put together. She now hopes to be a role model for other people in domestic violence situations and show others that there is life after walking away and that they do not have to suffer in silence.

        Domestic and family violence is preventable and can be stopped. Victims of violence often live in fear for themselves and their families, even when they have left an abusive relationship. Over the past 18 months, significant progress has been made in the Australian community in raising awareness of domestic and family violence. As a government, we are addressing what should be a simple goal—that all Australians deserve a life free from violence. In 2015-16, the government will deliver more than $500 million to front-line services, which will provide support to vulnerable Australians, including women experiencing violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        To those in our community who are suffering from or have left or are preparing to leave a situation where they are affected by family and domestic violence, I want to say to you today that there is help and support. Although it is described as the hardest step, asking for help is an important first step. There is a wide range of services and payments to help people in need. A great starting point is to phone 1800

        (1800 737 732)—the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service. I encourage people who witness domestic or family violence to also be proactive and report instances of domestic violence and support those in the community who need that support at this very difficult time.
