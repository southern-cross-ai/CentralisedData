        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on the action the government is taking to protect Australian families from dangerous non-citizens, including criminal gang members, and keep us all safe? Are there any risks to the government's approach in relation to these important matters?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question and thank her very much for the work that she does to keep her community safe. As we've always said, the first priority of the Turnbull government is to keep Australians safe, and we have cancelled a record number of visas held by non-citizens who have committed crimes against Australians. In fact, the number is up by 1,200 per cent, and it includes some 540 visa holders who have committed offences of assault, 415 for other violent offences and 441 for drug offences. We have cancelled 52 visas for people who have committed murders, and 110 for rape and other sexual offences.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am also pleased to inform the House that we have now cancelled 147 visas for non-citizens who were members of outlaw motorcycle gangs—members who were involved in the distribution of drugs. The biggest distributors of drugs in this country are outlaw motorcycle gang members. They are also involved in robbery, extortion and murder.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I'm sorry to inform that there has been an unintended consequence from the cancellation of these visa holders who are outlaw motorcycle gang members. It seems that we have created somewhat of a shortage in the hired muscle required by the

         on building sites around the country. This wasn't an intended consequence, but it is a positive one. And it is difficult for the Leader of the Opposition. He reaches always for his glass of water right at this point in time—right on cue. He knows what's coming, because the CFMEU aren't only involved in extortion rackets on building sites, breaking the arms of carpenters and people who won't pay the extortion money to the CFMEU; they're also deeply ensconced in the
