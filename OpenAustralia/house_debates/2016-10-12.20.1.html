        Roads and complacency are a deadly mixture. Over 1,200 Australians still die annually on our roads. Alarmingly, the number of lives lost actually rose by 6.9 per cent in the year to August 2016. When Australians feel let down by government it is often because the tangible problems they face every day of their lives never seem to get addressed. Last election, after years of campaigning from people from all walks of life and all sides of politics, bipartisan commitments were given to allocate $50 million of federal funds to begin the upgrade of one of Australia's most infamous death traps, the

We cannot wait for our community to lose another mother, father, brother, sister or child. I request the government to urgently provide the $50 million required.
