        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake stage 2 of the redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        at an estimated out-turned cost of $49.8 million plus GST. RAAF Base Darwin is a major military air base in the Northern Territory. The base primarily supports overseas deployments and transit operations as well as major Defence exercises.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the second redevelopment planed for RAAF Base Darwin and seeks to address aged, substandard and dysfunctional infrastructure and facilities which do not comply with current standards. The redevelopment project will involve a new logistics headquarters, office accommodation, a fuel farm, a mechanical equipment workshop, a vehicle wash bay and demolition of redundant facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval the construction phase will commence in 2009 and be completed in 2011. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake a redevelopment of Robertson Barracks, the home of the Army’s 1st Brigade. The works now proposed are required to meet the requirements of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        in a complex strategic environment and to meet the requirements of the government’s Hardened and Networked Army initiative and introduction of the Abrams tank fleet. The works consist primarily of extensional replication of existing facilities. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposal is $72.1 million plus GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Defence accepts and will implement these recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval the works would commence in early 2009 with the objective of having them completed in 2011. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        ) facilities at Edinburgh Defence Precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Hardened and Networked Army initiative, which was approved by government in December 2005, greatly strengthens the Army’s protection, mobility, firepower and communications, allowing operations in more complex, dangerous and uncertain environments. The initiative will increase options for the government in terms of both the combat weight of the force that can be deployed and the duration that forces can be sustained on operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of this initiative, the 7th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment—7RAR—is being re-raised as a mechanised infantry battalion. The battalion currently occupies temporary facilities in Darwin but will be based at Edinburgh Defence Precinct, Adelaide, along with supporting artillery, combat engineer and logistics troops. The Hardened and Networked Army Facilities project at Edinburgh Defence Precinct, at an out-turned cost of $623.68 million plus GST, will provide working accommodation, training facilities, urban warfare training facilities, a driver training area, a vehicle wash point and common user facilities for both Army and

        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake stage 5 of the redevelopment of RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine, in the Northern Territory, at an estimated out-turned cost of $58.7 million plus GST. RAAF Base Tindal is part of a chain of airfields stretching across

       </p>
       <p>
        This proposal will be a mixture of new facilities, refurbishment and extension to existing facilities and will include upgrades to the base engineering services, aircraft maintenance facilities, warehousing, new fuel tanker maintenance and liquid dry oxygen facilities as well as catering and messing improvements. The proposed project will improve the operational and support capabilities assigned to the base, correct limitations and deficiencies with existing facilities and infrastructure and enhance the working environment for base personnel to an acceptable level. It will address occupational health and safety issues and facilities which no longer meet Australian and Defence standards.

       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal will provide new infrastructure at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory to enable the new airborne early warning and control aircraft to operate effectively from the base. This new capability will be an integral part of a layered

        The aircraft will be home based at
