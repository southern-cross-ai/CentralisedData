        My question is addressed to the Minister for Workforce Participation. Would the minister advise the House how the government plans to assist the unemployed to move to areas where it is easier to find jobs?

         I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Of course, the member for Cowper, like many on this side, is concerned that everybody has the chance to get a job in these times. We have the lowest unemployment—on average a 30-year low right across the nation—but there are still some patches where unemployment is higher. So we as a government are determined to assist all Australians, especially people in areas of lower employment, to move across to parts where the economy is particularly booming, like over in the west and in northern Australia. We have therefore instigated a very special pilot that is going to assist people—in the first instance, from places like

          Coffs Harbour
         </a>
         and Shoalhaven—to move across to areas like Broome, Kalgoorlie, Perth, Darwin and Karratha.

         members will be especially commissioned to do the actual supporting and recruitment, through videoconferencing and phone hook-up, so that people do not have to go a long way just on the chance that they might succeed with a job. They will also be supported with the upskilling that is necessary. Finally, there will be $4,000 to $5,000 in travel support which will cover not only the costs of the air or other fares but also the costs to help set up in the new location.

         Sadly, the opposition has little interest in the Aussie job seeker striving to become financially independent. The shadow spokesperson, Senator Wong, has said, yes, there might be a workforce participation policy coming along—but we have not seen one yet. There was a time when Labor did talk about mobility assistance. It was a policy many years ago. Let me quote to you exactly what it was about. In particular it said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ... immediate minor assistance is a one-off payment available to unemployed job seekers who find a job but are unable to take it up because of the costs involved; for example, to buy special equipment or pay union fees.
        </p>
        <p>
         The good news is that in this country being able to afford to pay the unions is no longer a barrier to finding a job. This government is making sure that all job seekers are helped, even if they are now living in a place where there is some higher unemployment. We will support men and women to go to those places where the booming economy has work waiting, from the most skilled end through to a job where people can be trained when they get that job. This is a great initiative, and I strongly recommend that the opposition get behind this because it is about giving all Australians a fair go.
