        This past Sunday, July 30, was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of Friendship, a day dedicated to fostering bonds of camaraderie, understanding and mutual respect amongst people of different backgrounds. This day is a day the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        proclaimed in 2011, with the idea that friendship between peoples, countries, cultures and individuals can inspire peace efforts and build bridges between communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm filled with pride and gratitude as I reflect on some remarkable events I had the privilege to attend in our vibrant and diverse community of Chisholm over the last few weeks. These are events that exemplify how diversity is really our greatest strength, the power of multiculturalism and the unity it brings to our society. This International Day of Friendship serves as a timely reminder of the value of cultural exchange and the role it plays in promoting peace and harmony in our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have recently had the pleasure of attending numerous events for celebrations during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Dragon Boat Festival
        </a>
        . The Dragon Boat Festival events were hosted by a range of organisations: the Chinese Health Foundation, who actively promote healthy lifestyles and spread mental health awareness within our community; and Asian Australian Volunteers, who look after members of our community with accessibility needs by delivering groceries, driving them to the pharmacy or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        and helping people to access essential services. I attended events hosted by the Chinese Seniors Education and Skill Development Association, a group that assists seniors and migrants to develop skills and assist them with working their way through our local communities, understanding and navigating their way through the area in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Waverley" rel="nofollow">
         Glen Waverley
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Waverley" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Waverley
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had the opportunity to attend the Melbourne Spring Arts Multicultural Seniors Association, who bring seniors together in our community with a love of music, art and dancing that also helps to promote healthy living and active lifestyles. I was treated to a really wonderful concert by the Melbourne Spring Arts Multicultural Seniors Association. These organisations and the contribution they make to Chisholm symbolise not only the rich cultural heritage of the Chinese community in my electorate but also the strength and unity that transcends boundaries of origin. I'm really grateful to have been invited to share in such special events.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Dragon Boat Festival, also known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duanwu_Jie" rel="nofollow">
         Duanwu Jie
        </a>
        , is an ancient tradition celebrated in many
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian" rel="nofollow">
         East Asian
        </a>
        countries. It holds deep historical and cultural significance dating back over 2,000 years. The festival falls on the fifth day of the fifth month in the lunar calendar, a time when we witness the beauty of the Chinese community coming together to honour their ancestors, promote harmony and celebrate the spirit of teamwork. Around 29 per cent of people in my electorate have Chinese ancestry, and you can be sure that it was a terrific time of celebration throughout our communities of people coming together. On this side of the House we've always been champions of multiculturalism, and these festivities really allow us to witness the true essence of that, where people from different backgrounds are able to unite to share traditions and experience food, music, dance and culture.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this spirit of inclusivity, diversity and multiculturalism, I also want to talk about the recent Monash and Whitehorse council citizenship ceremonies, which are always some of my absolute favourite events to attend. It is always an honour to be there as a local representative as people take that very significant step to become an Australian citizen. These ceremonies mark the beginning of a new chapter in the lives of so many people who choose to call Australia their home. I love having the opportunity to meet new citizens at these special events, to learn about their journey—some very long and some very difficult journeys—to make this country their home.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Australia, we welcome people from every corner of the world, embracing the many different cultures that make our community so strong.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we engage with one another's customs, language and heritage, we nurture a sense of interconnectedness, which is the sort of thing that the International Day of Friendship was implemented to help us do. It was implemented to help us foster a sense of peace and harmony in our communities. We know that when we embrace diversity, our communities are stronger and safer. I'm so proud to represent one of the most multicultural electorates in Australia. It's a real pleasure to be able to share some of those events with the House today. and it is a real pleasure to be able to share with you some of those events with the House today.
