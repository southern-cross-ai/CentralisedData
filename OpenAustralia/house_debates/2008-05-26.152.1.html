        This week is Macular Degeneration Awareness Week. The aim of the Macular Degeneration Foundation campaign this year is to highlight the importance of having your eyes checked and, in particular, to ensure that your macula is checked. The macula is the central part of the retina that processes all the visual images and is responsible for your ability to read, recognise faces, drive, see colours clearly et cetera.

That is estimated to grow to about $6.5 billion by 2025. I would like to express my appreciation for the Macular Degeneration Foundation for their continued—
