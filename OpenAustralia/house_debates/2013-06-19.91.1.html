       </p>
       <ul>

         FOR
        </a>
        REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill has been strongly criticised by employers, industry groups, the Migration Council of Australia and labour market experts, including the government's own advisers who have universally indicated that there is no evidence including from the Department of Immigration to support the suggestions of widespread rorting alleged by the Minister and government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill reintroduces labour market testing which operated from 1996 to 2001 and was found then to be ineffective, costly and a significant delay to employer recruitment action. It also introduces a number of additional compliance and enforcement measures. These changes represent a major additional regulatory burden on business yet the Bill has been developed without consultation with industry groups or labour market experts. In addition the Prime Minister has exempted the bill from a Regulation Impact Statement for unspecified exceptional circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill requires further investigation into the regulatory impact the proposed changes will impose on Australian business and industry, together with impacts on labour market efficiency and business productivity from the reintroduction of labour market testing in particular. An inquiry is required to ensure no adverse impacts arise that would prohibit businesses from accessing the skilled labour they need to support Australian jobs and Australian investment.
