        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Ten Network reported government staffers had allegedly brought in sex workers to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        for government MPs, including a minister. What steps has the Prime Minister taken to investigate these very serious allegations, which constitute a blackmail risk and potentially jeopardise national security.

        <p>
         I thank the member for his question. It is indeed a very, very serious issue that was reported yesterday afternoonâ€”deeply distressing, deeply shocking. I understand the report referred to a former minister, not a current minister. So I would simply make that point. I don't think that's disputed or any other implication was being suggested by the member in the question that was raised.
        </p>
        <p>
         Two things are directly being done. Obviously we are seeking to pursue those matters with those who are already known to us. There is only one individual that was the subject of the reports yesterday, and that person has had their employment terminated. But we have reached out through whatever avenues we have for people who have knowledge of that to bring that knowledge forward so it can be addressed by the government or any proper authorities, for that matter. I have no doubt for the presiding officers as well, regarding the use of certain parts of this building, it would be equally distressing and shocking. I find it just absolutely abhorrent that this could occur. We are in no position to establish its truth or accuracy. That has not been established. But, if anyone has information on this issue, I would be very keen for them to make that available to us.
