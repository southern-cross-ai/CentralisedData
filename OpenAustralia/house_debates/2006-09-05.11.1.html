        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Immigration and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        and refers to the granting of a further 21 temporary worker 457 visas to Sydney company ABC Tissue Products. Can the minister confirm that ABC Tissue Products was initially investigated by the department of immigration in August 2005, over a month before he attended the sod-turning ceremony last year? Minister, in light of the Prime Minister’s admission yesterday that this company has been issued with multiple infringement and compliance notices, including for immigration breaches, workplace and safety breaches and taxation breaches, will these 21 new visas be reconsidered or revoked?

         just say in relation to the question asked that I will check as to when any information was first received by the department of immigration in relation to ABC Tissue Products. I would note that there are two corporations involved in relation to the building of this factory—the company that is manufacturing on adjacent sites, ABC Tissue Products, and Hunan services, if that is the correct name, a company owned in China by the Chinese government. I think it is Hunan Industrial Equipment Installation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The advice I have is that on 28 July 2006 DIMA issued Hunan Industrial Equipment Installation with a notice of intention to sanction, on a number of grounds—including a failure to pay minimum salary levels, to comply with immigration laws, to comply with workplace relations laws, to ensure necessary licensing of workers and to notify Immigration of relevant changes of circumstances and deduction of tax instalments. A response was received on 4 September—

           A response was received on 4 September and the department is continuing to have discussions in relation to that matter in assessment of the claims that were given in response. Depending upon those findings, the department will decide whether or not sanctions might be applied. This could include barring Hunan from participation in the 457 program. The department will then contact visa holders to determine what their options might be.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am also advised that in relation to ABC Tissue Products, which was a separate matter, there were two visa holders who were found not to be carrying out duties in relation to a nominated position. A response was received which is being presently reviewed. Again, the situation is that, if there are matters that are not satisfactorily resolved, visas could be cancelled.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to the further question, there were, as I understand it, 21 visas granted on 22 and 23 May 2006, again following sponsorship by Hunan. The allegations were first raised by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
            AMWU
           </a>
           in a letter to the minister on 23 May—that is, after the visa grants. No further visas or nominations have been approved for Hunan since that time.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would simply make the point that the Prime Minister made yesterday. If there are breaches of the law in relation to the way in which visas have been sought in these particular matters, they will be dealt with properly in accordance with the law, as you would expect.
