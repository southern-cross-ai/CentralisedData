        Earlier in this debate, the member for Wills made a contribution in relation to the government’s proposed disposal of the Jezzine Barracks historic area in Townsville. As I was in the chair at the time, I was prevented from responding, but I am now able to make that response. Virtually all of what the member for Wills said and claimed was wrong. Does that really surprise us? No, it does not. It was a political speech, and it is an example of what has been happening for the last 12 months in Townsville in relation to the debate on what might happen to Jezzine Barracks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Wills kept saying ‘the government’ was proposing this and ‘the government’ was going to do that. That is just not the case. The current process is that Defence is examining its options so that it can make recommendations to the government. The government has not yet received any recommendations whatsoever, so the government’s position is basically not known at this stage, or not settled. I have certainly been working very hard behind the scenes because I want to see an outcome where Jezzine Barracks becomes a magnificent bookend to Townsville Strand. We need to be able to do that, and we can do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        In an unusual move, I flew to Townsville yesterday in an attempt to get the Labor council to talk to their federal member. They have been running a political campaign for 12 months, but they refused to engage with me—and therefore the government—to get the best outcome for our community. While I was heavily criticised in the Townsville media overnight for flying to Townsville and for spending taxpayers’ money, my mission was successful. The outcome was that the Labor mayor has now agreed to come to Canberra next Thursday to meet with the parliamentary secretary and me, to bring a delegation and to operate in a businesslike manner, not in a political manner. That is a great outcome, because at the end of the day you need the federal government and the local council working together to get the best outcome for the community. Just politically sniping at each other is a waste of time, a useless exercise and unproductive. I am pleased that I have been able to drag the Townsville mayor into a meeting with the government to work with us to get the best outcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can guarantee the people of Townsville and Thuringowa that I am going to ensure that we have a magnificent resource in Jezzine Barracks. I have had the privilege of seeing other sites—for example, Australia’s artillery museum at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Head" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the Federation project around

        . I want to incorporate many of those very good ideas into the ideas that we have for the redevelopment of Jezzine Barracks. It is a very significant coastal fort, one that has an important place in the heritage and history of our nation. It is also a very significant area where the

          It was. It is good to see an appreciation of the history. I have succeeded so far in having Defence recommend that more than 80 per cent of the land be given over to the community. That is a great outcome. No land will be sold to commercial developers. There will be no high-rises on the site. Some land will be retained for defence purposes, but there is now a magnificent opportunity to get a great outcome for our community. I intend to make sure that the
