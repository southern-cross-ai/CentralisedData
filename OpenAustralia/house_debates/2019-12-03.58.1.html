        My question is to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services. Will the minister outline how the Morrison government's stable and certain budget position is guaranteeing the delivery of the

         in his electorate, noting of course that WA won't come into full scheme for a number of years. It's important also for the House to understand that this government is absolutely backing in Australians with disability, their families and their carer, and we are absolutely committed to making the NDIS deliver for people with disability. We can make that commitment because of one reason and one reason only, and that's the strong economy and the certain budget position and the full funding of over $18 billion this year, rising to $22 billion in the coming years.

         As at 30 September there were 311,000 Australians in the NDIS, and what is extraordinarily pleasing is 114,000 of these Australians—

          <p>
           are receiving a service for the very first time in their life, which is extraordinary. We've seen an 11 per cent decrease in the number of younger Australians in residential aged care and a 22 per cent decrease, quarter on quarter, in the number of new young Australians coming into residential aged care. A full joint agency task force has now been put onto that issue to ensure that there'll be no younger Australians in residential aged care by 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
           Further improvements have also been made. Access decisions in relation to progress into the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           have reduced to an average of only 12 days. Similarly, the time for first plans being approved is now at 88 days compared to 133 days previously. Huge improvements have been made in younger Australians aged zero to six gaining access into early childhood early intervention. In terms of assistive technology and home modification quotations, they've reduced to only 5,000 in terms of a waiting list, and this will be cleared by the first quarter next year. Of course, the NDIS provider market continues to grow, up six per cent this quarter to 13,434. The number of houses for specialist disability accommodation has increased in the last 12 months by a staggering 89 per cent, up to almost 3½ thousand.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is what a strong economy and a strong budget position delivers. It delivers great outcomes for Australians with disability.
