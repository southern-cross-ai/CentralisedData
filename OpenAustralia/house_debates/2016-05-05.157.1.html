        I rise also to speak about the Stronger Communities grant program, which has provided much-needed funding to local organisations in my federal electorate. The Holt Stronger Communities Program aims to support local community groups and sporting organisations to provide funding for projects that would improve local community participation and cohesion and contribute to vibrant and viable communities. Each project was considered by our Holt Stronger Communities grant committee. I would like to thank the members—Leanne Petrides, from the Cranbourne Information &amp; Support Service; Amanda Carron;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Rogers" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; Judy Owen; and Stephen Hallett—for volunteering their time and assisting very assiduously in the assessment of each of the grants.
       </p>
       <p>
        In round 1 of the Holt Stronger Communities grant applications that were submitted last year we had five projects approved by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. One of the grants that was approved was for $12,465 for the Narre Warren State Emergency Service unit. This is a very busy emergency service unit. The Victoria
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        Narre Warren received a grant to fund a kitchen replacement. This project will replace the existing kitchen area and will include the installation of new sinks, taps and wall units. The grant will assist the SES to increase the internal space in key areas of the building and provide a safer working area to cook and prepare meals.
       </p>
       <p>
        This grant is a welcome funding boost for the Narre Warren SES, particularly given—as I said—the amount of work that they do. For example, in the recent severe weather events in Melbourne, they had 170 call-outs around the Narre south area on Saturday night. Another example is when we had the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Hampton Park
        </a>
        floods in 2011, when we had 600 residences flooded, and we had 735 call-outs. They are a very, very busy organisation, full of good volunteers who do the necessary work to support and keep our community safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another successful recipient was the Nanaksar Thath Sikh Temple in Lynbrook, which received over $5,000 to establish and to furnish a new community centre. This will include the purchase of new tables and chairs, laptops and shelves. This community centre aims to equip the local migrant community, not just the Sikh community, with the tools and skills required to integrate with Australia's way of life whilst maintaining a connection with the faith and the culture of the Sikh community and the migrant communities that access this particular facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sikh temple plans to conduct information sessions in the community centre to educate migrants in how they can contribute to the wider society—these are their words—in a positive way as citizens, parents and individuals. As English is not the first language of many migrant families, English language and other lessons will provide essential skills to navigate day-to-day life and also help navigate through the sometimes byzantine and complex systems of government agencies. I want to congratulate the Nanaksar Thath Sikh Temple on receiving this grant.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Casey Life Church in Hampton Park, served beautifully well by pastors Graham and Julie Shand, also received $8,863 in a grant for the purchase of equipment to assist in conducting iconic community events like the annual Hampton Park Carols by Candlelight. This event started small, but last year we would have had about 5,000 to 6,000 people attending. It is because of the work of the Casey Life Church that we are getting that building of the community in the Hampton Park area, which has taken a number of hits over the past six to seven years. They will be given funding for the project to upgrade their existing sound system, amps and audiovisual equipment, including the purchase of a digital sound desk, amplifier, wireless microphones and related equipment. They are a very deserving group of people.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the St Paul Apostle Catholic Church has received a $5,000 grant for upgrading their kitchen and meeting room appliances. This project will entail the purchase of a new stove, fridge and freezer. The project will also entail the purchasing of a new oven, microwave oven, hot water dispenser and television for the community meeting room. That church is used quite extensively by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Endeavour Hills
        </a>
        community. The church kitchens are mainly used to prepare sandwiches and soup for distribution via a soup van that at present operates twice-weekly to provide for local residents in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        All in all, they are very deserving organisations. The Southern Migrant Refugee Centre was another one that received funding out of round one, but there are many more organisations that have applied for round two. They are deserving organisations. These organisations are the lifeblood of the community. They provide much uncosted work to the community to keep the community ticking over. I would like to thank everyone who participated in those community organisations and hope that a number of the other organisations that have applied for round two funding will be successful.
