       <p>
        I wish to make a statement to the House, and I ask all members to remain silent. At the beginning of the year, I presented to the House the annual report on the implementation of recommendations from the
        <i>
         Set the Standard
        </i>
        report. The Prime Minister then moved a motion to the House to endorse the draft behaviour standards and codes from the report of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Standards. This endorsement was an interim measure pending the establishment of the agencies and framework for enforcement of those workplace standards and codes for parliamentarians and parliamentary staff. Members across the chamber made heartfelt contributions to that debate. We must continue in that same manner, and as this is the final sitting before the House adjourns for the winter, I thought it was timely to remind members of our shared responsibility in relation to developing a safe and respectful culture at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Our general demeanour and the courtesy we show one another in the chamber matters. From the language we use to the tone and volume of our contributions, the standing orders guide and support respectful dealings in the chamber. As a House, we have changed our standing orders to facilitate more family-friendly hours. Further, as all members have seen, I have been firm and consistent in asking members to withdraw unparliamentary terms when raised by other members.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have clear guidance too about general responsibilities from the safe and respectful workplaces training program, as well as those draft behaviour standards and codes for parliamentarians. We need to act individually and collectively to enliven those values in our culture. Before the House returns on the last day of July, I want to encourage each of us to genuinely reflect on our own behaviour and consider what contribution we are making and could make towards a safe and respectful workplace environment for the parliament. I thank the House.
