       <p>
        More than 20,000 Australians with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities are currently working in Australian Disability Enterprises, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE" rel="nofollow">
         ADE
        </a>
        s, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Endeavour Foundation
        </a>
        . These ADEs are not-for-profit commercial operations set up specifically to provide a meaningful and positive employment experience for intellectually disabled people who choose to work. These jobs are tailored to accommodate each individual's capabilities and to maximise their job satisfaction. It gives them confidence, gives them independence, gives them pride, gives them a sense of accomplishment and gives them a regular social outlet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyone who has ever taken the leap from education to employment will know how important the early working years are for building a person's self-worth as well as developing new skills. The workers are also paid. Not a minimum wage, but a wage based on competency under Fair Work's Supported Employment Services Award. Most of the individuals working in ADEs also receive a disability pension, but the supported wage system gives them the opportunity to earn and it furthers their sense of independence.
       </p>
       <p>
        As mentioned, these ADEs are not for profit. If there's any surplus from their operations, it's simply used to enhance working facilities and the whole operation. Most people who hear about enterprises like the Endeavour Foundation and the great work they're doing think this is a win-win. But there are always some who can't see the positives beyond their own soapbox. Certain activist groups have been mounting legal challenges aimed at discontinuing the great work of these ADEs. They're alleging that those with intellectual disabilities are being exploited and want to see them paid the full national minimum wage or removed from specialised employment altogether. These allegations are totally absurd. These are Australians who have chosen to work in enterprises that are set up specifically for people with disabilities to have the opportunity to work. I've been to the workshop of the Endeavour Foundation in Mackay and I've met with people who work in that workshop. Some of them were in tears at the prospect of their workplace being shut down—and it is a very real prospect. If these enterprises are forced to pay minimum wage to all of their employees, regardless of competency, they will simply fall over. All eyes will then turn to the federal government to foot the bill, but I've got to tell you: we are in the midst of a pandemic which has put the government—or should I say the taxpayer—the best part of $1 trillion in debt. There is already significant government funding going into disability services through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        . We do not have the luxury or the finances to cover further ongoing operational costs by forever subsidising employment for intellectually disabled Australians. The current formula works for employees. It works for ADEs. There's no reason to change it. These people deserve the opportunity to work and to be valued. Do not take that opportunity away from them.
