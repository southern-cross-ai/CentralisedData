        My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Minister, what action is the government taking to help prevent and address the neglect of children in the

         I thank the member for Calwell for her question. Yesterday the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         government both received and released the report of the inquiry into their child protection system. The
         <i>
          Growing them strong together
         </i>
         report does shine the spotlight on their child protection system not coping with the very significant numbers of children who are being neglected and abused. While it is the case, as I am sure all members of this House are aware, that state and territory governments are responsible for their statutory child protection systems, the Australian government will continue to work with the Northern Territory government in the interests of children. We announced yesterday that we will provide additional funding to increase the number of parents on child protection income support; we will provide additional family support services, boost the number of child protection workers, particularly in remote communities; and we will also provide additional funding to strengthen alcohol controls. I am sure it is the case that every single member of this House would agree that one of the most significant responsibilities of any government is to work to protect vulnerable children. No matter where children live, they deserve to grow up happy, healthy and safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been the case that there has been very strong action in the Northern Territory over the last three years. The previous government instigated the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Emergency_Response" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory Emergency Response
         </a>
         and this government has continued that work. We have added an extra $1.2 billion to make sure that we improve the delivery of services in the Northern Territory.

           In fact there have been 82 houses built, if you would like to know. Yesterday I released the most recent monitoring report. There is a monitoring report released every six months, and, instead of
           <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">
            interjecting
           </a>
           and making remarks that are inappropriate in such an important debate, I would suggest that those members who are interested actually read the report and see that there are now additional police on the ground in remote communities which never before had police in their communities. There have of course been tens of thousands of child health checks and specialist follow-up services with doctors and dentists. There are now an extra 140 teachers in schools in remote communities. There are safe houses that have been built and more creches that have been built. Very importantly, we are in the process of putting in place the new income management system which will improve parental responsibility to make sure that welfare payments are spent in the interests of children. Most significantly, for the first time we are introducing the new child protection income management system, which does mean that child protection workers can now refer parents for 70 per cent of income management in cases of neglect. This is the increased support that we are providing to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           government. We also recognise that they too made a very substantive response yesterday and will continue to work to make sure that children get the support that they need.
