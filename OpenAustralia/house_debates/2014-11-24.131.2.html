       <p>
        Before I invite honourable members to make constituency statements, I wish to provide a status report on progress with physical enhancements of this Federation Chamber. All members will recall that, in the last sitting period on 22 September, I made a brief statement in relation to the 20th anniversary of the Federation Chamber and foreshadowed some physical enhancements to improve its facility and authority. I am pleased to report that several of these enhancements are now in place. In additions to the screens displaying captions about proceedings, there is improved signage at the main north-east chamber entrance, a redesigned desk for the Deputy Speaker and the clerks, a central table to accommodate chamber documents and purpose-built lecterns in the front row of members' seatsâ€”which I warmly encourage members to use. They have been designed so there are no chairs in front of them, enhancing the lecterns and giving the speaker's words to the chamber greater authority. A new coat of arms, enhanced lighting and some artwork are anticipated in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of routine maintenance matters have also been addressed. I am sure honourable members will agree that the chamber looks very sound and fresh. In closing, I would like to thank the staff of the office of the Serjeant-at-Arms and of the Department of Parliamentary Services for all their efforts in progressing this enhancement project. I am sure they will contribute to the continuing successful operation of this Federation Chamber. Many other parliaments around the world have now adopted the principle behind the Federation Chamber, which has now been successful for 20 years.
