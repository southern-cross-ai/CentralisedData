       <p>
        I want to record my sincere appreciation and admiration for retiring Barossa Mayor Mr Brian Hurn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . I have known Brian both as a local government colleague and more recently in my capacity as the federal member for Barker. Brian is, of course, a local institution in the Barossa and he will be remembered as a giant across several fields, including sport, agriculture, public service and community leadership. Following a celebrated sporting career that included, amongst other things, winning the

        for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        in the 1963-64 side—which I should say included no less than seven Australian players, two of whom went on to captain the nation; he also played in that side with

        </a>
        and one former member for Barker,

         Ian McLachlan
        </a>
        —he joined local government in 1977 in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_Council" rel="nofollow">
         District Council
        </a>
        of Angaston. He served as chairman of that council for 10 years and subsequently as Mayor of the Barossa since 1996. Brian has served as president of the Southern and Hills
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA" rel="nofollow">
         LGA
        </a>
        and on the Local Super Board and was chairman of the Local Government Transport Advisory Panel. He has been honoured as the 2010 recipient of the John Legoe Award. In 1994, Brian Hurn was awarded the national medal for his services to community in hazardous circumstances. In 1999, he was bestowed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for service to local government through the Barossa council and the community
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BankSA" rel="nofollow">
         BankSA
        </a>
        . In 2001, he was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Centenary Medal
        </a>
        for his service to local government. While Brian Hurn has decided to retire from his position as mayor, his example will long be a benchmark for those of us in public life to aspire to.
