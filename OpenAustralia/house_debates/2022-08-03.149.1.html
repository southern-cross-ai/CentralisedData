       <p>
        It's an honour to rise today to speak as the member for Isaacs as I now enter my sixth term in this parliament. My first and most important duty is as the member for Isaacs. As we learned at the last election from some high-profile examples in my home state of Victoria, the privilege of being re-elected by your constituents can never, ever be taken for granted. Every election is hard work, and every victory is hard won. My job was made easier by those who dedicated so much time and effort during the campaign to keeping Isaacs in Labor hands. To the hardworking and tireless volunteers who stood with me at prepoll for many hours, knocked on doors and made countless phone calls: thank you. You are the lifeblood of our party, and you are also great company. To my electorate staff, who not only support me during campaigns but do vital work every day to help constituents: thank you. I could not do this without you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those many hours at prepoll were full of interesting and engaging conversations with voters. Many were ready for change and tired of the old excuses of the former Morrison government. Many were cynical that things would never change. To those people, I want to say this: whether or not you voted for me, the new Albanese Labor government will deliver change for the better. We are a government which will listen. We are a government which will deliver on our promises. When things go wrong, we will not make excuses; we will be honest and frank, as the Australian people deserve. We will fight every day for you. We promised a better future, and I truly believe better days lie ahead. To the people of Isaacs, thank you for voting for me once more and for putting your trust in me. It's an honour to once more represent you in this place.
