       <p>
        I stand to make a tribute following the tragic death of my constituent Luke Beyer, from Ballajura. On Friday night, 27 May 2011, on the corner of Illawarra Crescent and Sloop Rise in Ballajura, Luke Beyer, who had finished his shift at the local supermarket, had just dropped off some of his friends that he had picked up from the cinema. As he was sitting in his car, around the corner came a drink-driver, who may have been speeding as well. Without deviating, this drink-driver went up onto the footpath, across the verge and hit the car that Luke was sitting in. As a result, Luke died later in hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        I make my condolences today to his familyâ€”his mum, Colleen; his dad, Martin; his brother, Matt; and his grandad, Tony. On Sunday, 5 June, there was a commemorative service at the Ballajura War Memorial and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Peace Park
        </a>
        . Afterwards, I spoke to Luke's grandad, Tony, who spoke of what a fabulous young bloke he was. When you think that Luke had finished his shift, had gone to pick up his mates and was dropping them off around Ballajura, it is a real indication of what a great guy he was.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commemorative service held on Sunday, 5 June was organised by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Davies" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who initiated both a social media commemoration and the memorial, which was attended by more than 2,000 members of the Ballajura community. Friends attended, as did those who did not know Luke but nevertheless felt that something needed to be done about these sorts of circumstances where somebody is innocently killed by the reckless and dangerous actions of others. That day was not a day for politics; it was not a day for political statement. But it was a day to reassure the family that something good has to come out of these circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst we must always look at law enforcement and laws to punish people who offend, we must also look at the need for attitude change. People cannot just take their own lives and disregard the lives of others by their reckless actions. What must come out of this is that we must always say, 'Enough is enough.' More people need to look at themselves and make that decision: 'I'm not going to take the lives of others in vain. I will not take risks with the lives of others because I just want to do what I want to do.' That is the sort of attitude change that is needed. All the other laws can only be looked at in the light of attitude change.

         I thank the member for Cowan and I am sure that all honourable members would join him in the sentiments he so eloquently expressed.
