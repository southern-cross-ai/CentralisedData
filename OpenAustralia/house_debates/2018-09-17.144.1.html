        In Lalor, every day, we turn housing developments into communities. I have had the pleasure in the last fortnight of visiting Alamanda College and being a principal for a day there in the Principal for a Day program, where I saw the extraordinary work in doing exactly that—in taking the young people, the prep to year 9 young people in our community and working so hard to build our community. I want to congratulate Principal Lyn Jobson on the terrific work that she is doing. It is an extraordinary school doing extraordinary work, where lifelong learning in a calm learning environment is happening every day and where the principal shares her wonderings and grade 6 students respond with thoughtful analysis about the things they've been studying and that other students have been studying.

        On Friday night, I attended the Tarneit P-9

        school production—another great example of the work that goes on in our local schools to build community. Not only did I join the school community to see a fabulous production, but I was stunned at the talent that's been unearthed in that college. This was a celebration of life, most certainly, as the Lion King suggests, but in both schools, I also saw a celebration of diversity.

        On Saturday I attended the Ganesh Festival organised by Vinayak and Neha Kolape in my electorate. I want to send congratulations to the whole team for what was a wonderful celebration, and wish everyone wisdom and good health.

        Finally, a shout-out to all of our local football teams that have competed in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRFL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        as it's known locally, over the past few weeks. Congratulations to the winners, Point Cook Football Club, and to the Manor Lakes women's team on winning their grand final. And a hearty good luck to the Hoppers Crossing Football Club, who will run out next week to contest the division 1 grand final against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Park" rel="nofollow">

        —more power to their arm. I finish with a big shout-out to the Werribee Centrals netballers. The Werribee Centrals Football and Netball Club compete in the Geelong and District Football League. It is fair to say that Werribee Centrals are the dominant netball club. They have won again across many age groups, including the division 1 grand final. I'll join the Werribee Centrals Football Club this week for their presentation night. I'm looking forward to seeing all of the footballers, but, most importantly, I'm looking forward to sharing a glass of champagne with the netballers on another terrific year.
