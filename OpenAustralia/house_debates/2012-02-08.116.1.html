        The overall amendment introduces a new requirement after proposed section 8J of the Telecommunications (

         Consumer Protection

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        before being permitted to make a declaration under section 8J. Proposed subsection (1) explains how the independent review is to be appointed. Proposed subsection (2) is in place to ensure that sufficient voice-only customers are connected to the NBN to allow an accurate assessment of the voice services over the NBN. Proposed subsection (3) establishes 1 November 2011 as the baseline against which NBN services will be compared by the independent reviewer. Proposed subsections (4) and (5) detail the matters the independent reviewer should consider in conducting his review. Proposed subsection (6) requires that the minister must table the independent reviewer's report in both houses of parliament.

        <p>
         I indicate to the House that I have earlier outlined at once the reasons why we are opposing all of the opposition's amendments on this package of bills before the House. I outlined in great detail the five reasons why. I will not repeat those reasons, for the purpose of the efficiency of the House, but I will say that the government rejects these amendments and calls upon the House to support the government's existing legislation and therefore support the universal obligations that are so important for regional Australia.
