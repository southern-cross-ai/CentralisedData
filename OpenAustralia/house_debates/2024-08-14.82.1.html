        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry and Capability Delivery. What steps has the Albanese Labor government taken to accelerate defence capability and ensure a future made in Australia after a wasted decade?

         I thank the member for Makin from the mighty defence state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         for that question. We face the greatest strategic uncertainty since 1945. The first duty of any Commonwealth government is to protect Australians and keep our country safe. In this, a consistent approach is essential with a unity of purpose. Leadership is critical. But, sadly, under the last government goldfish lasted longer than defence ministers. That has now changed. I'm delighted to inform the House that the Deputy Prime Minister has now served as defence minister longer than six of the seven defence ministers in the last government—six of seven! And I've now served longer than six of the seven defence industry ministers in that wasted decade. That stability and unity is delivering results, leading to accelerated capability.

        <p>
         But it starts with a budget, and this government has increased the defence budget by $50 billion over the decade and $5.7 billion over the forward estimates—something those opposite are refusing to match. In fact, they're arguing for a cut to the defence budget. We've increased the Integrated Investment Program by $60 billion, and these increased resources and stable, consistent leadership are driving a very significant speeding-up of capability compared to the approach of the last government in their wasted decade. Under them, there was to be one new frigate in 2034; under us, there are to be four by 2034, the first in 2030. Under them, the first infantry fighting vehicle was to be in 2029; under us, it will be in 2027 and made in Australia. Under them, the first heavy landing craft was to be in 2035; under us, it will be in 2028 and made in

         . Under them, manufacturing missiles was to start in 2035; under us, it starts next year. Under them, contracts for armed drones were cancelled; under us, the first armed drone arrives this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         This focus on speed to capability will not only result in advanced equipment for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         ; it will create more high-skilled, well-paid jobs in the Australian defence industry. Through stable leadership and unity of purpose, we are bringing capability forward while supporting a defence future made in Australia. That is what a mature, adult government does, rather than the last one, which was addicted to all spin and no delivery—a former government whose defence minister, the now Leader of the Opposition, couldn't even deliver ships with safe drinking water for our sailors.
