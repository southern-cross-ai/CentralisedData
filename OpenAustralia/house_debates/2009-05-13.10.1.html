       <p>
        I am pleased to introduce the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4105" rel="nofollow">
         Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Amendment Bill 2009
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It renames the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AusLink" rel="nofollow">
         AusLink
        </a>
        (National Land Transport) Act 2005 (the principal act), as the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill is central to the effective delivery of the government’s road and rail infrastructure investment through the Nation Building Program—a program currently worth more than $26 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        we are investing over $8.7 billion through the Nation Building Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are making a record investment in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        which will see a range of projects delivered, including:
       </p>
       <p>
        The Ballina bypass; the upgrade to the Sapphire to Woolgoolga section; the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banora_Point" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p>
        The final work on the Hume Highway is the construction of the bypasses at Tarcutta, Woomargama and Holbrook.
       </p>
       <p>
        Due to the funding the government brought forward in its December 2008 nation-building package, the Tarcutta and Woomargama bypasses will commence earlier and be completed in late 2011—more than six months ahead of schedule.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Holbrook bypass is scheduled for completion by 2012.

        we are investing close to $200 million through the Nation Building Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        This funding includes the road upgrade in Canberra’s airport precinct as well as the Tharwa Road-Lanyon Drive upgrade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other investments through the Nation Building Program include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         $1.75 billion in the Roads to Recovery program
        </li>
        <li>
         $500 million in the black spots program
        </li>
        <li>
         Our additional investment in this program through our stimulus packages is seeing an additional 607 black spots addressed right across the nation.
        </li>
        <li>
         $70 million in the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program
        </li>
        <li>
         $150 million in the Boom Gates for Rail Crossings Program
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        All states and territories have signed up to deliver the Nation Building Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be noted that, when in government, it took the now opposition more than a year to get all states and territories to sign up to their AusLink program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our Nation Building Program has the full support of all states and territories and its implementation is underway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night we announced an additional investment of $8.5 billion in rail, roads and ports infrastructure for Australia to lift productivity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investing in nation building today to support jobs and provide infrastructure for tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rudd Labor government will invest $35 billion over six years on transport infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Howard government failed to deliver on Australia’s infrastructure needs and left us with an infrastructure deficit.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to the bill, the amendments to the act put in place the appropriate provisions to ensure the effective delivery of the suite of initiatives now funded under this program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill proposes changes to ensure:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         more effective provisions for major road and rail infrastructure projects on the national land transport network, as well as for those projects that are off the network; and
        </li>
        <li>
         more effective provisions for the Roads to Recovery program and the black spots program.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Given the transition over the last 18 months from AusLink to the implementation of the Nation Building Program, this bill changes the references to AusLink in the act so that it is now referred to as the Nation Building Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also amend the principal act to make it clear that part 6 can be used to approve funding for projects which are off the national land transport network in both regional and metropolitan areas of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also makes appropriate provisions to allow sites that are on the national land transport network to become eligible for black spot projects funding under the act. Previously, only off-network black spots were eligible under this part.
       </p>
       <p>
        This change will facilitate the effective implementation of the additional $150 million investment in black spot projects by the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also provide further flexibility around the Roads to Recovery program by enabling the amounts of funding to local government authorities to be increased if the minister sees fit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Previously, no increases could be made to the amounts specified in the Roads to Recovery list after the initial list for a funding period had been determined.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also enable the minister to exempt a funding recipient from having to call for tenders on a project approved under section 9 of the act where the cost of the work will be under an amount prescribed in the regulations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, an amendment to the principal act is being made to ensure the minister can specify a funding condition that a funding recipient adheres to the terms of a matter contained in any other instrument or document as in force or existing from time to time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The intention of this amendment is to enable the minister to require recipients of federal funds to adhere to the terms of a nominated instrument or document as they are at any given time.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, if the terms change in any way, the funding recipient is required to adhere to the changed terms, not those which were in force at the time the funding condition was originally made.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill plays an integral part in advancing the government’s Nation Building Program and deserves the support of the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
