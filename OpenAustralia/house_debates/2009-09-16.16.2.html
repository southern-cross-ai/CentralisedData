       <p>
        by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the fifth report for 2009 of the committee relating to the proposed fit-out and external works, Anzac
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_West" rel="nofollow">
         Park West
        </a>
        , Parkes,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        and the proposed fit-out of the Tuggeranong Office Park, Greenway, ACT.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report,
        <i>
         Referrals made May to June 2009
        </i>
        , addresses proposals to fit out two buildings in Canberra, Anzac Park West in Parkes and Tuggeranong Office Park in Greenway. In both cases the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives agree to the work proceeding. The first project discussed in the report is the fit-out of Anzac Park West in Canberra for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the committee on 14 May 2009 at an estimated cost of $4.5 million. Anzac Park West is a heritage building as well as being an important part of the National Capital Plan. The committee is pleased to consider a project that will see it occupied after an extended period of vacancy. This building first came before the committee in 2006 in the proposal by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        . Members may be aware that this inquiry was rescinded from the committee’s consideration and thus the committee did not have an opportunity to complete this inquiry and some $48 million was spent on base building works. The building was ultimately too small to accommodate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        and it remained empty. The series of events is unfortunate and the committee discussed its specific concerns in the report. Given this background the committee is happy to see the Department of Defence plans to occupy the building. The re-use of an existing building will realise significant savings in both money and energy and demonstrates the opportunity to creatively refurbish buildings almost half a century old and greatly extend their economic life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second project discussed in the report is the fit-out of the Tuggeranong Office Park in Canberra for the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The project was referred to the committee on 28 May 2009 at an estimated cost of $29.8 million. This department has occupied part of the Tuggeranong office block since 1991 and the building is generally in need of base building works to maintain it as a safe work environment. In addition, the department will refit much of the building to improve its disability access and environmental performance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The department is to be commended on its use of environmental initiatives, particularly in the extensive use water tanks to service the grounds and some parts of the building which is quite innovative in its nature and shows a real commitment by the department. This proposal also raises some concerns for the committee, particularly in the terms of investment over a short-term lease. However, the committee ultimately accepted the department’s assurance that the proposal represented value for money for the Commonwealth. I would like to thank the committee members for their work in relation to this inquiry and I commend the report the House.
