        The ongoing contributions made by volunteers in the Paterson electorate are extraordinary to say the least. I would like to acknowledge and dedicate this speech to all the special individuals who take time out of their own busy schedules to assist others. These volunteers often leave behind their loved ones and jobs to assist those most in need. Often they put their lives on the line to help others in distress and they do it for no recognition and usually at high personal cost—financially, mentally and physically. They deserve our utmost support, gratitude and respect.

       <p>
        Last week I had the pleasure of meeting with a group of volunteers in the Paterson electorate, in the form of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Volunteer_Coastal_Patrol" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Stephens" rel="nofollow">
         Port Stephens
        </a>
        , to present them with an Australian flag. These men and women are an extraordinary group of people and I thank them for their kindness and generosity towards both me and their community over the years. We should never underestimate the emotional as well as physical toll that these 136-strong members endure to serve their Port Stephens community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coastal patrol has a role at all levels in assisting members of the boating community in order to educate and protect themselves, their passengers and their vessels. In Port Stephens the extraordinary group of men and women who make up the volunteer brigade carry out marine search and rescue work, other waterborne services and services of a public or community nature. They also provide theoretical and practical instruction on seamanship subjects and boat handling and assist public authorities. The members who volunteer as part of the coastal patrol must endure some trying experiences and yet they still manage to act with such professionalism and decorum, and for that I have deep respect for them. On Friday I had the pleasure of awarding Port Stephens Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol member Lloyd Cropper a national medal for his service in the patrol over the past 18 years. What struck me about Lloyd was how humble he was to receive such a prestigious honour. Lloyd, like many of his colleagues, is a role model not only for the Port Stephens community but also for all. He has repeatedly gone out of his way to assist others without seeking any sort of gratification.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I stood there with Lloyd, in front of his fellow volunteers and family, I thought to myself, ‘What a great man, what a great inspiration and what a great privilege it is for me to be part of this moment.’ In my role as a federal member of parliament I have had the pleasure of meeting many inspirational individuals such as Lloyd, yet I will never grow tired of such a privilege. It is people such as Lloyd and other members of the division—such as Division Commander Geoff Moore, Operations Officer Peter Bevan, Administration Officer Michael Smith, Education Officer Ilene Kelly, Search Master Rod Reeson and Public Relations Officer Bob Young, to name but a few in the time available for this speech—that reaffirm my faith in mankind if I am struck with disturbing examples of human behaviour in the news. If we each assisted others as Lloyd and his fellow members continue to do then I would hold great hope for our combined future.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is with great pride that I reflect on Australia’s proud history of volunteering. Every year, millions of Australians offer their time and talents in order to help build a better community. It is a characteristic which has helped define our young nation and made it one of the greatest places on earth to live. It is mateship in its truest form. All contributions made, whether they are grand or small, are appreciated and are what keep the true spirit of Australia alive. I am proud to give 100 per cent of my support to members of the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Port Stephens, and thank them for their tireless dedication to assist their local community and for their professionalism in carrying out duties under what are often difficult circumstances. It is my hope that, as Australia comes of age, we as a nation continue the legacy of great volunteer organisations such as the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcome the news that a merger may take place between Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol and Volunteer Coast Guard to become one unit. This will no doubt build an even stronger, more harmonious maritime rescue unit that will better attract both corporate and government funding. It should be better funded by all levels of government. It goes without saying, no matter whether it stands as a combined or stand-alone division, I wish the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol, Port Stephens, and every one of its members every success in their future. I look forward to continuing to work with them closely to ensure that the Paterson region remains one of prosperity.
