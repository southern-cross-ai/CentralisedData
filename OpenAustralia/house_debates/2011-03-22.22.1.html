             Interestingly, as we get on with the business of health reform, we have also been moving legislation through this parliament. Yesterday the first piece of significant health reform legislation passed in parliament. It was opposed in this House by the Liberal Party. It was opposed in the Senate and again in the House yesterday and, ironically, the opposition led by Mr Abbott actually has opposed legislation that is permanently establishing a body that the Leader of the Opposition established temporarily when he was the health minister. I make this point because it seems that, whether it is carbon, health reform, or whether it is a rolled-gold, rock-solid guarantee, the Leader of the Opposition changes his mind from day to day. He is not just a weathervane on carbon; he cannot make up his mind what he wants to do on health. He has been inconsistent, uncertain and just downright weird. Listen to what the Leader of the Opposition said when he introduced and established the Safety and Quality Commission.

               Order! For those on my right that ask why, you can ask me, because I adjudicate on these matters. I took an adjudication in running that, whilst it is a robust and perhaps an extreme sort of comment, I in the past indicated when I had another role that the member for Warringah is not necessarily a precious petal and he has a hide. Whilst it may be unfortunate I decided it was not something that I would ask to be withdrawn. But I did not take that point of order as an interruption. I think that that was properly raised with me, but I will allow it on this occasion.

                I want to quote to the House the comments from the member for Warringah in 2005 when he was the Minister for
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
                 Health and Ageing
                </a>
                in the days when he supported the need for a safety and quality commission. He said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                … a national safety and quality commission will make it more important for doctors to have comprehensive records, access to the best possible information retrieval systems, and useable checklists against avoidable mistakes.
               </p>
               <p>
                Apparently these are now good and important changes for the health system that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party no longer support because they are inconsistent and uncertain about every possible policy issue we are debating in this parliament.

                  Before the Prime Minister leaves, it is often the practice of the Prime Minister to come back to the House with an answer to a question posed earlier. Mr Speaker, I ask you to ask the Prime Minister if she has been able to ascertain whether the three people who scuttled the boat received protection visas.

                    The member for Cook will absolutely understand that there is no precedent without an order of the House for the Speaker to take the actions that he has asked for. That is why I think when I say with generosity that he has made his point he should leave it at that.
