        when they spoke about getting rid of renewable energy in this country. This wouldn't be such a problem except for the fact that the keynote speakers for this conference include Raheem Kassam, a far Right activist with a history of racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia, who made appalling comments about the Scottish National Party Leader Nicola Sturgeon after she suffered a miscarriage. Other speakers include American gun fanatics like Matt Schlapp, who has been called out for racist dog whistling by American conservatives and former Republican Chair Michael Steele.
