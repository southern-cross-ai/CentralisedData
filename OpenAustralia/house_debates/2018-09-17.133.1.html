       <p>
        Last Friday I held my annual older Australians morning tea awards at the Smithfield
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It's always a great function—I've done it now for many years—where we come together and celebrate older Australians and their contributions to our community. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge in the House some of the recipients of the awards. Desmond Metcalf has volunteered at Fairfield Food Services meals on wheels service for many years—over a decade. Rita George works with newly arrived refugees, helping them learn English and assisting with their paperwork in our community. Our community welcomes may refugees, and Rita does great work. Nancy

They have raised over $300,000 for the Cancer Council. The event is now so big that Channel 7 comes to Australia's Biggest Morning Tea at Horsley Park. Jan Galmes has volunteered her time for over 10 years at Southern Cross Greystanes Residential Aged Care. Vera Critchley has been a volunteer at Westmead Hospital for 18 years and is a former president of the Ringrose Avenue school mothers' club. David Sarkis gives up his time working with St Hurmizd Assyrian church. Irene Lazar does volunteer work for St Zaia church, and has done so for 15 years. William Lazar has been the leader of his seniors group for the last nine years. Ludi Vaga is a volunteer at

          Finally, for the last two years I've instituted a new award. I haven't always done this, but for two years now, we have awarded the McMahon Older Australian of the Year to somebody who deserves that little bit of extra recognition. They're all very worthy recipients, but the McMahon Older Australian of the Year is an award that we now present. I think all present on the day—and I'm sure all members of the House would agree—that

          Again, the older Australian morning tea is a highlight in our calendar. Many people come every year. We always have some people for whom it's their first performance. I want to thank Smithfield
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
           RSL
          </a>
          for joining me in hosting it. I couldn't do it without Smithfield RSL's support. We arranged the entertainment from Danny Elliot, a very accomplished international artist who sang and performed for us on the day. We have a great morning. We celebrate older Australians and everything they've contributed to our community. It's a very important day for me as the member for McMahon. It's good when it comes between two sitting weeks. It's quite a change of scenery and pace from parliament. It's good to celebrate with older Australians their achievements and their contribution to our community. They've worked hard all their lives and they use their retirement to give back. An older Australia morning tea is a wonderful opportunity to thank them and celebrate their achievements.
