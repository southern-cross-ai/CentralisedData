        It is strange that I should follow the member for Corio speaking about one great football club when I want to speak about that other great football club of this nation: the Warwick Greenwood Junior Football Club—the Knights. Last Friday night I attended their awards night.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Knights" rel="nofollow">

        are my local junior

        football club because I live in the suburb of Warwick. They are the second-smallest club in their league, but while they may be small in numbers they are mighty in spirit. Why is that? Mr Speaker, I know that you would know what it is like. You walk into a room, and the feeling of pride and esprit de corps is immense. I could tell that this was a strong community organisation, a strong local club for local people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such a strong spirit will always see results realised. It is the sum of that collective strength that saw the delivery of two premierships. This year the 13s and the 14s both won their premierships, and I congratulate the boys for those strong victories. I also congratulate the coaches of those teams. Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Dickson" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Dickson
        </a>
        is coach of the 13s. Apart from being a champion coach, Steve is also the principal of Hocking Primary School and, as the foundation principal, he has got that school in an excellent state. I know that my constituents in Hocking have welcomed the opening of the school and Steve’s efforts in making sure the children have the best educational facilities and educational aids available. The coach of the 14s is James Anfuso. I congratulate James not only for his team’s victory but also for his leadership as president of the Warwick Greenwood Knights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the club had two victories, such success could not occur without the efforts of its volunteers. I would like to specifically mention three of the volunteers recognised at the awards night. Mr Norm Bryant won lifetime membership. Norm has been involved with the club for 23 years. He started when his son Garreth began Auskick. This was before the amalgamation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Districts" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Districts
        </a>
        and Warwick football clubs into the Warwick Greenwood Knights. Garreth stayed with the club for all of his junior football career, finishing with the under-17s. Norm has been involved at many levels throughout his time with the club. He has been a coach and member of the committee for many years despite Garreth finishing with the club about five years ago. He is a quiet achiever. He is the sort of person who goes about his business without any fuss or fanfare. He has been the grounds manager for the last six years; it is a job that he does conscientiously and thoroughly. He can also be relied upon to help out whenever there is something happening. Whenever there is a need for work to be done at the club, he will always be there.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also make mention of Suzanne Brooke, who won the Club Person of the Year award. Suzanne is a busy single mum who works full time but is also very active on the committee. She is the treasurer and next year will also be the registrar. She runs the canteen on Saturdays and Sundays; that was where I saw her when I was last down at one of the games.
       </p>
       <p>
        Helen Watkinson was nominated by the club community as the Club Volunteer of the Year. She has two boys who play football for the club and works as a registered nurse, but she still finds time to be involved as a team manager and also does first aid for her other son’s team. She was also part of the quiz night organisation this year. The honour of presenting her with the Club Volunteer of the Year award fell to me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also pay tribute to the members of the committee: James Anfuso, the president; Glen Stribbling, the registrar; Liz Manera, the secretary; Kevin Josephsen, the vice president; Suzanne Brooke, the treasurer; Norm Bryant for grounds;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtney_Jones" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Watson" rel="nofollow">

        for property. Finally, I once again congratulate the club and the players for the success they had this year and the volunteers for their dedication. I wish the Warwick Greenwood Knights, that other great football club of Australia, every success in 2009.
