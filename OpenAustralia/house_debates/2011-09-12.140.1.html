       <p>
        On Sunday a week ago, my electorate celebrated the annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Moon Festival
        </a>
        . As in every year, this is an event that brings the community together for a day and a night of music, food and a number of activities for the young and old to enjoy. I am very proud to represent the electorate of Fowler, which is in the south-west of Sydney and is the most multicultural electorate in the whole of Australia. I have the honour of representing one of the largest Asian communities outside Asia itself. In fact, 20 per cent of my electorate is Vietnamese, and a further 10 per cent speak a Chinese language. Traditionally, the Mid-Autumn Festival, or the Moon Festival as it is called, is a harvest festival that celebrates unity and family reunion. It is widely celebrated through China, Vietnam and throughout other Asian countries. Many of us believe that the moon is at its brightest and its roundest at the height of the mid-autumn, and hence the evening event brings together a celebration at this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Moon Festival this year continued to honour the children in the community, with cultural performances, traditional dragon and lion dances, special midnight feasts, street parades with the children carrying lanterns and, naturally, fireworks. Every event once again reiterates the importance of nurturing the multicultural nature of our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Multiculturalism in Australia is about building a shared sense of nationhood forged through mutual respect, common values and a commitment to fairness. I am happy to be part of a government that is committed to Australia's multiculturalism and supporting policies and programs that strengthen social cohesion and promote participation. The recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         People of Australia
        </a>
        policy is one for all Australians and embraces the four principles of celebrating and valuing diversity; maintaining social cohesion; communicating the benefits of Australia's diversity; and responding to intolerance and discrimination.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cultural events in my local community such as the Moon Festival are built very much on these four principles. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Fairfield City Council
        </a>
        in organising the committee who have done an excellent job with this year's Moon Festival. I would also like to acknowledge the Cabramatta police, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Emergency_Service" rel="nofollow">
         State Emergency Service
        </a>
        and the fire brigade, who gave up their time to participate in this community event. I would especially like to thank all the volunteer sponsors and supporters because without them this day would not have been possible.
