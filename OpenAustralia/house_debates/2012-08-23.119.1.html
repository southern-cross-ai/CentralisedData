        On Friday, 3 August I attended the meeting of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Tree_Gully" rel="nofollow">
         Tea Tree Gully
        </a>
        VIEW clubâ€”one of two view clubs in the Makin electorate; the other being the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Grove" rel="nofollow">
         Golden Grove
        </a>
        club. VIEW stands for voice, interest and education of women. I understand that there are about 400 VIEW clubs nationwide with a total membership of about 20,000. The Tea Tree Gully club was formed around 12 years ago and has grown to 84 members. True to its name, the club provides an excellent forum for giving voice to and broadening the interests of local women. In addition, the club actively supports deserving community groups and engages in much fundraising in order to do so. I particularly commend VIEW clubs around Australia for their support of the Smith Family charity organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        What particularly caught my interest at the meeting were the four resolutions that VIEW club members throughout the country were being asked to consider and vote on, they being, firstly: VIEW clubs of Australia call on the Australian government to implement the recommendations in the Gonski report to achieve rural equality in educational opportunity for all Australian children; secondly, VIEW clubs of Australia call on the federal and state governments to develop a long-term national housing plan which is gender aware and responsive to combat Australia's housing affordability crisis; thirdly, VIEW clubs of Australia resolve that the importance of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Health_Directive" rel="nofollow">
         Advance Health Directive
        </a>
        document be promoted and that a nationally recognised advance health directive form be made readily available in appropriate public places throughout Australia; and, fourthly, that VIEW clubs of Australia lobby the state and federal governments to initiate an opt-out or presumed consent regulation whereby organs may be removed from a diseased person for the purpose of transplantation if they have not expressed an objection to donating their organs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The arguments for and against each proposition were clearly summarised to assist members with their decision. Each of these resolutions deal with very important contemporary social issues. Unlike governments and politicians, VIEW club members considering the four propositions are not constrained by political or budgetary consequences and therefore are likely to reflect more accurately community attitudes on these matters. I urge decision makers to take note of the VIEW club members' responses to the four propositions, as a poll of 20,000 members should not be dismissed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge the meeting's guest speaker of the day, well-known and respected ABC personality David Bevan, who provided an entertaining and fascinating insight into his radio career and the background work that goes into preparing each program. I am grateful for David's presence as it was good to have a fellow male at an otherwise all-women's event. I thank President Helen Allen and Tea Tree Gully VIEW club members for the community work that the club engages in and for the warm reception I have received when I have attended their meetings. I also wish VIEW club members well with their upcoming national conference.
