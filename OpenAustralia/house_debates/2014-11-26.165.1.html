        In this place we often debate the role of government—its size and breadth, and those areas where public policy affects our society and its people. However, it is important for all members to remember that what makes this national truly strong are the individuals and families around this country that bind together to make great communities. These communities are dynamic, innovative and resilient. They nurture children, support each other and care for those who are vulnerable. This spring I have been mindful of this as I have been out and about in my electorate of Higgins, meeting with community groups who, on their own initiative, make an invaluable and irreplaceable contribution to our nation.

        With the warming weather in Melbourne, the number of community festivals across my electorate is astounding, and I have strived to attend as many as humanly possible within my weekly schedule. I attended the Pink Tennis Day for women and girls at the Malvern Tennis Centre in Carnegie, which raised $4,000 for the

        . I took part with thousands of people in the Murrumbeena Relay For Life—the longest continuous running relay in Victoria. I held a stall at the Stonnington Spring into Gardening festival in Prahran, where I was visited by our foreign minister, Hon.

        It was such fun to open the Solway Primary School fair in Ashburton after participating in a hard-fought spelling bee with some of their very charming children—no pressure in that! Similarly, I was yet again impressed by the strong attendance and local spirit at the St Kevin's College Family Fun Day and the Malvern Primary School Spring Fair. Just last weekend, I helped out at the sausage sizzle at the Very Special Kids Fair, an annual fundraising fair for the largest and oldest community hospice in Australia. It is an extraordinary organisation and an organisation that deserves all of our support. Most recently, I held a stall at the Ashburton festival, a wonderful opportunity for traders and the local community to get together in advance of Christmas.

        This is just a snapshot of what has been happening within my electorate and, I know, in communities all across this great country. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet with local people and I am inspired by their endeavour and their ingenuity. They reaffirm my belief in volunteerism, civil society and small and competent government. Most importantly, they inspire me to continue in my work in representing their interests to the best of my ability and to ensure good government for all Australians and a better future for our nation.
