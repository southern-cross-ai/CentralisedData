       <p>
        It's my pleasure to rise today to congratulate all the year 12 students at Hazel Glen College, who will be graduating in the coming weeks. Standing here in my Hazel Glen tie reminds me that these year 12 students have faced immense and unprecedented challenges over their final years of school. The disruption to education, to work and to family life that has been felt over the course of the pandemic cannot be understated, but the perseverance of the students, staff and teachers over the course of this pandemic is something that is an inspiration to all of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I want to give my congratulations and praise to the incredible co-captains of Hazel Glen, Alex Mitris and Grace Gillies, and of course the vice-captains, Calizta Jankowitz and Sascha Allen, under the leadership of Principal Anthony Stockwell. Over the course of this pandemic, we've all had to learn, face new challenges and adapt to new circumstances. These students have taken on the responsibility of leadership during one of the most challenging times in our history, and they have done so with courage, conviction, compassion and a leadership far beyond their years.
       </p>
       <p>
        So to all the year 12 students at Hazel Glen College, I say: congratulations for all your hard work and dedication and good luck as you move into the next phase of your life, whether it's transitioning to university, learning a trade or just taking a well-earned year off. Please know that you have been an inspiration to us, and we thank you so much for everything you have done.
       </p>
