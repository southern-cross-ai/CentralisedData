       <p>
        I rise in the Australian parliament today to honour the life of a most remarkable woman: Vera Deacon. Today the people of Newcastle are mourning the loss of one of our most treasured citizens. As a published writer, feminist, historian, environmentalist, philanthropist and committed humanitarian. Vera Deacon's legacy is immense.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met Vera through our respective involvement with the Newcastle Aboriginal support group. Her knowledge and unswerving commitment to facing squarely the truth of our nation's history was inspiring. Vera became a trusted friend and mentor. She was a woman of strength and integrity, grounded by her social justice values, and Vera's support meant a lot to me, especially when I decided to run for public office. Vera was an advocate for so many causes in our community, but she was especially devoted to the preservation and promotion of the natural environment and local history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born in Mayfield in 1926, Vera was raised on Dempsey and Mosquito islands in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_River" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter River
        </a>
        estuary before they gave way to heavy industry and submerged into what is now one big island known as Kooragang. Vera loved the Hunter River, and she worked tirelessly on the rehabilitation of those islands where she grew up, volunteering as part of the Kooragang Wetland Rehabilitation Project since its very inception. For more than 20 years she helped plant more than 200,000 seedlings of native plants across about 100 different native species, from memory, including the red cedar and the ash tree of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Ash Island
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Vera also worked closely with the Stockton Historical Society to research and compile the history of these islands and their surrounds, helping to preserve Newcastle's unique heritage. This important work led to Vera making regular and substantial donations to the University of Newcastle's cultural collections. In recognition of her generous contributions, the university set up the Vera Deacon Regional History Fund to support and encourage regional histories. It was to build on Vera's generosity with donations to help collect, document and digitise our regional history archives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not one to show off or big-note herself, Vera lived her life with purpose, determined to make a difference, and she did. A memorial service to celebrate Vera's life is being held in Newcastle today, Thursday 3 June. This date also marks the anniversary of the High Court's Mabo decision, something that I know Vera would be very pleased with. My heartfelt condolences go to Vera's family, friends and loved ones. Vale, Vera Deacon. You have lived a full life without regret, and I for one will miss you terribly.
