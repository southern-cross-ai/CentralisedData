       <p>
        It is my great pleasure to be one of the co-chairs of the National Leadership Forum alongside the member for Berowra, Julian Leeser MP. I remember when Julian came up to Garma. It might have been last year. But, of course, he resigned from his position because he couldn't stomach the lack of leadership within the party that he is a member of when it came to taking our country forward in terms of reconciliation and a better future for Australia. I make the point that no leader worth his salt lets an opportunity like Garma go by, as they did this year, without turning up and being willing to take part in the conversation about how we continue to talk with each other and take Australia forward.
       </p>

        The National Leadership Forum is an opportunity for both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to talk with a wonderful group of young Australians from all around the country who do come here together. I want to thank the MPs and senators that do take one of those young leaders or a group of those young leaders into their offices. It's not too late if you want to volunteer to do that. When they come into the office of an MP or senator, they talk about their leadership experience and their values. I think that's incredibly important. It's a great opportunity that we have to mentor those coming throughâ€”the future leaders of our great country.
