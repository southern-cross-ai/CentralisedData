        On Sunday I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepean_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Nepean Hospital
        </a>
        and its emergency department in my electorate to see the terrible state that it's in. There were 83 patients in our emergency department at 3:30 on a Sunday. We have just 32 beds. In seven years the Liberal state member,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Ayres" rel="nofollow">
         Stuart Ayres
        </a>
        , has done absolutely nothing to increase the staffing or bed capacity at Nepean. The promise of an upgrade is a mirage; the $550 million he promised is not even in their budget for this year. We are now in the grip of the worst flu season in history, and presentations in my hospital have increased by up to 266 per cent. This is without any additional staff, doctors or beds.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a 24-hour period last week, our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ED" rel="nofollow">
         ED
        </a>
        saw 266 emergency presentations. I reiterate that we have 32 beds. After 12 years, our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        after-hours clinic, which was co-located at the entry to the emergency department, has been moved off site. There have been several complaints from patients, staff and the medical profession about this move. Our community was given no consultation. As anticipated by those of us with some common sense, it is no surprise that this move has increased the number of ED presentations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This incompetence is on a grand scale. I fear for the safety of our community through these poorly-thought-through decisions. Stuart Ayres, I urge you to raid the coffers that you have created by selling off our assets in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . Get the staff on the ground and the beds open and give relief to the most under-pressure hospital in the state. I urge you to show some respect to the people who have elected you to represent them.
