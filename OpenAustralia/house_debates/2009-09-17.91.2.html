            . On the basis that the building will be fit out appropriately, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Defence
            </a>
            has signed a memorandum of understanding and a lease for Anzac Park West with the Department of Finance and Deregulation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anzac Park West is a vacant heritage listed office building located within the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Triangle" rel="nofollow">
             Parliamentary Triangle
            </a>
            . It was built in 1966 and, along with Anzac Park East, is a portal building, framing the vista between
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

             Australian War Memorial
            </a>
            . Anzac Park West base building refurbishment was completed in December 2006 within budget at a cost of $48 million, prior to a planned fit-out by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Federal Police
            </a>
            . In July 2007 the Australian Federal Police advised that Anzac Park West would no longer suit their accommodation needs due to unprecedented growth. The Australian Federal Police subsequently requested to be released from their lease commitment to the building, and the planned fit-out works were not undertaken.
           </p>
           <p>
            The proposed fit-out of Anzac Park West for the Department of Defence will house approximate 900 staff and comprise: a base building modification works; office accommodation of approximately 15,000 square metres, including a reception area, meeting rooms, offices and work points for the remaining staff; landscaping; external works, including passive security measures, new pathways, car park rectification, and the planting of trees and plants; and base building works to the pavilion adjacent to Anzac Park West.
           </p>
           <p>
            Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in February next year with targeted completion by October 2010. In its report the

              Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Proposed fit-out of leased premises for the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs at Tuggeranong Office Park,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">

              .
             </p>
             <p>
              The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs proposes to undertake a fit-out of Tuggeranong Office Park at a cost of $29.872 million, including
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
               GST
              </a>
              . Tuggeranong Office Park is located at block 2, section 14 of the division of Greenway and the district of Tuggeranong,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Capital Territory
              </a>
              . The national office component of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is currently spread over eight tenancies, with a total net lettable area of approximately 48,000 square metres.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tuggeranong Office Park complex base building is 18 years old and has not been substantially refurbished or refitted since its construction was finalised in 1991. There are works required to improve compliance of the office accommodation to current Commonwealth standards. The refurbishment and fit-out of the Tuggeranong Office Park will provide a significantly improved level of accommodation and allow for the consolidation of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs property portfolio. The Tuggeranong Office Park provides approximately 33,000 square metres of office space; 2,800 square metres of storage space; 760 enclosed and open car parks and ground-level bicycle parking for 150 bikes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tuggeranong Office Park also accommodates the Canberra Data Centre, which is considered critical national infrastructure. The works have been scoped to provide a modest-level fit-out that reflects the remaining term of lease to December 2016. The works will ensure that the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs provides quality office accommodation and meets its legislative obligations to provide a safe and secure workplace. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that the proposed works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs accepts and will implement these recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, the program of works is anticipated to commence in September 2009, with a completion date for all works in September 2010. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.
