        (   I rise to inform the House of some recent goings-on in Bennelong. Max Potential is an initiative of Clubs New South Wales and the Future Achievement Australia Foundation and for the past few years high school students in my electorate have benefited from this fantastic and unique program. Focusing on leadership development, Max Potential runs over 22 weeks and matches high school students with community coaches. Over the duration of the program they work together to develop personal goals during group and one-on-one coaching sessions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I attended the 2014 Max Potential showcase, in which these young leaders exhibited the programs they had implemented in their schools and beyond to help other members of the community. One created a confidence-boosting program for teenagers—something that he had personally developed throughout the program. Another created a Facebook guide for seniors, helping older members of our community stay in touch with their grandchildren. Others created fundraising drives and information programs about existing charities and causes to educate and challenge their school communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall these young adults all developed confidence and skills that they will be able to take forward with them into the future. I commend the hardworking efforts of Mel Hanger, the Max Potential team, Club 6 and the community coaches in implementing this program and inspiring our leaders of the future.

        As you would all know, last Friday was the Cancer Council's Daffodil Day. I spent part of the day joining members of the local community selling daffodil merchandise to raise funds for the Cancer Council, both at Eastwood station and

        shopping centre. I was so impressed by the generosity and willingness of the public to open their purses and wallets in support of this great cause. Cancer is an insidious disease that will touch each and every one of us in some way at some time in our lives. The Cancer Council raises vital funds for cancer research, patient support and prevention programs. I wish to personally thank the coordinators and volunteers who so selflessly gave their time in support of the Cancer Council.
