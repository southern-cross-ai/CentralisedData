       <p>
        On 19 October 2006, the member for Swan raised a matter of privilege relating to the apparent cancellation of an invitation to him to attend the official launch of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Corps" rel="nofollow">
         Green Corps
        </a>
        project in his electorate. The honourable member claims that the cancellation of the invitation amounted to a grave interference in the free performance of his duties as a member.
       </p>
       <p>
        An act or omission which obstructs or impedes members in the discharge of their duties as members can be regarded as a contempt. Whether such findings are made depends on the circumstances of each case. I note that the member’s attendance at the event in question was by a foreshadowed invitation and that the initial message was subsequently withdrawn.
       </p>
       <p>
        The attendance of members at the launch of Green Corps programs in their electorates does not seem to be an essential part of members’ duties and hence attendance is by invitation, just as members may or may not be invited to other events within their electorates. Thus the cancellation of the invitation, while very regrettable for the honourable member, does not seem to constitute an improper interference in the member’s performance of his duties as a member. To constitute a contempt, interference has to be improper, and it is not clear to me that there is evidence of impropriety in this case.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consequently, and while I understand the honourable member’s irritation about the matter, I do not propose to give precedence to a motion to refer it to the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges. I also remind members that matters of privilege should be raised at the first opportunity. I believe the honourable member spoke on this matter in the Main Committee on the previous day.
