        The northernmost tip of the Canning electorate is located approximately 30 kilometres from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_CBD" rel="nofollow">
         Perth CBD
        </a>
        . From there it sprawls southward over the Perth hills, down through farmland and forest and out towards the beaches of Mandurah on the west coast and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boddington_Gold_Mine" rel="nofollow">
         Boddington Gold Mine
        </a>
        in the interior. In total it covers around 6,300 square kilometres.
       </p>
       <p>
        While parts of Canning, like Byford and Mandurah, are densely populated, it is regional in character and geography. It's a place where the local service station also acts as a general store and a post office, and where families have farmed the same land for generations. But while the regional communities of Canning are proud of their rural identity and character, the fact is that they often struggle due to the lack of essential services and financial investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition saw that problem and acted. Through the Building Better Regions Fund, the coalition is committing $641 million to build infrastructure and foster jobs in regional communities. Under round 1 of the BBRF, Canning was the recipient of almost $3 million. This money has gone towards two vital projects: the Dwellingup Trails Centre will be the focal point of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Murray
        </a>
        's new adventure trails through the forested centre of the Peel region, and the expansion of the Quambie Park in the town of Waroona will increase its capacity to provide assisted-living aged care for the local district.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it doesn't stop there. Over the winter break, I have announced three new projects under round 2 of the BBRF. More than $3.5 million has been granted to Bedingfield Park, a community owned and not-for-profit nursing home in Pinjarra. With this funding, Bedingfield will finally be able to realise its long-term goal of building a 25-bed, high-care accommodation wing focusing on dementia care. As the only aged-care facility in the Shire of Murray, this is a much needed investment. It will also boost the local economy, creating 18 jobs during construction and another 18 upon completion.
       </p>
       <p>
        In North Dandalup, $2.5 million will be invested to help build an agri research centre. Led by

        </a>
        O'Connor, this project will provide cutting-edge research in farming and agriculture for the region. Two hundred thousand dollars has also been granted to the Waroona Men's Shed. A local institution, the Waroona Men's Shed has outgrown its current location. This funding will provide for the construction of a new shed, purpose built to enable the men to continue their craftsmanship for local schools and community groups. Finally, $95,000 has been granted to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Preston Beach
        </a>
        Community Centre. The community centre is the hub of the town, serving as a meeting place, arts centre, medical facility and emergency service hub.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regional towns like Dwellingup, Waroona, Pinjarra and Preston Beach are the heart of Australia and deserve our support. I look forward to the opening of round 3 of the BBRF and this government's continued support of regional Australia. Thank you.
