        My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel and Veterans' Affairs. Will the minister outline to the House how the Morrison government is continuing to support our veterans, including our Indigenous veterans and including our Indigenous defence businesses?

         I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He is, of course, a decorated veteran with 20 years of military service, and I thank him for that and also for his enduring interest in defence and veterans affairs. The contribution of Aboriginal and

         , over 120 years ago.

         In 1914,

          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         notes that more than 1,000 Indigenous Australians signed up to fight, even though at the time they weren't officially allowed to join, on the grounds of race. But the reality is that there are no precise records. When World War

          II
         </a>
         began, Indigenous Australians again answered the call to defend our country. That long and proud history of service continued through the years. Indigenous Australians served with distinction in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam and in all modern conflicts and peacekeeping operations over the past few decades. Our country must always honour that service and sacrifice, never forget it and ensure that all veterans, including Indigenous veterans and their families, receive the best possible care that our country can give.

         Reconciliation is a vitally important piece of national work. While we have come a long way, that work is unfinished. It's incumbent on all of us in this place and all around Australia to keep walking down that road of reconciliation. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         is committed to closing the gap and enhancing outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their communities and has now set a target of five per cent Indigenous participation by 2025. The Defence Reconciliation Action Plan contains 61 actions targeted at supporting Indigenous businesses, community engagement, recruitment and retention. Under the plan, Defence has awarded $1.86 billion in contract value to more than 550 Indigenous businesses since the Indigenous Procurement Policy commenced in July 2015. And, through the

         , we continue to support all veterans, including Indigenous veterans, with our wellbeing centres. I visited one in Townsville, Australia's largest garrison city, just a couple of weeks ago, with the member for Herbert. The

         has established the role of national Indigenous liaison officer and a network of Indigenous veterans liaison officers to work with Indigenous veterans to assist them in accessing entitlements and services.

        <p>
         I would like to thank and acknowledge all of our Indigenous service men and women, veterans and their families for their service and their sacrifice for our nation.
