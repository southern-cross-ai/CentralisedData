        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the 23,000 constituents in my electorate of Bendigo who are currently eligible for the low-income super contribution of up to $500. Can the Prime Minister explain why it is his government's priority to increase the tax on these Bendigo locals, real locals, who most need the support in their retirement whilst giving tax breaks to some of the largest corporations in the world?

         We went to the election being absolutely honest and up-front with the people of Australia. We were absolutely honest and up-front with the people of Australia that we could not continue unfunded benefits. We could not continue with benefits which were simply a cash splash with borrowed money.

         We were totally honest with the people before the election. The people elected us and we will faithfully discharge our obligations to them; we will faithfully honour the commitments that we made to them. And the best thing members opposite could do for the families of Australia, if they are as concerned as they say they are, is abolish the carbon tax. If they abolish the carbon tax, that will save the average Australian household $550 a year. Do not sneer at a saving of $550 a year. It is a very considerable saving and it is entirely in accordance with the commitments that this government made and that this government intends to honour.
