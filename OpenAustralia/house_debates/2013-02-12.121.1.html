       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge residents of the Lindsay electorate who were recently named in the 2013 Australia Day Honours List. Firstly, commended for his service to rugby league and to our local community through a range of charitable organisations, I recognise
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Geyer" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Geyer

        , who was awarded a

         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . Mark has been one of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Panthers" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith Panthers
        </a>
        ' best players and clubmen over the years, and he has also made an invaluable contribution to local charities, including by helping people with disabilities to get involved in sport. I congratulate Mark on this well-deserved accolade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another worthy recipient of a Medal of the Order of Australia was Diane Langmack. Diane was recognised for her great contribution to our community through charitable and women's organisations. Diane is particularly well known for her work with Women in League at Penrith Panthers and her role as chair of the Cure for the Future Foundation. I congratulate Diane on receiving this well-deserved honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also recognised on the Australia Day Honours List, I congratulate Kenneth Charles Wheeler, who was awarded an Ambulance Service Medal. Kenneth was one of only four people in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        to receive this prestigious award. This is an extremely well-deserved accolade for Kenneth, after 42 years of dedicated service to the New South Wales Ambulance Service.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also recognise all of the recipients of the 2013 Penrith City Australia Day awards. Named Penrith Citizen of the Year and Penrith Sports Person of the year, I congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Fox" rel="nofollow">

        and her ongoing sporting and academic success have been a great source of pride to many in our local community. I congratulate Jessica.
       </p>
       <p>
        Honoured with a Penrith Appreciation Award, I congratulate Michael and Jo-ann Morris. After nearly losing their two-year-old son Samuel to a drowning accident, Michael and Jo-ann have worked tirelessly to raise water safety awareness and to support families of children suffering from severe disabilities following near-drowning accidents. I pay tribute to the strength of the Morris family and I thank them for their ongoing contribution to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognised for his work as a local

        , surgeon and former Penrith mayor, I congratulate Penrith Appreciation Award recipient Dr William 'Bill' Gayed. This award acknowledges Dr Gayed's dedicated service to the Penrith community through a range of local organisations. Also receiving a Penrith Appreciation Award is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Bradley" rel="nofollow">
         Jan Bradley
        </a>
        , who was recognised for her long-term commitment to the Wallacia and Mulgoa Rotary Club. Jan has a great sense of social justice and I commend her for her dedication to helping those in our community who need it most. Finally, I congratulate Benjamin Egge, who was awarded a Penrith Appreciation Award for his work to empower the vulnerable in our community through teaching self-defence, anti-bullying strategies and boosting work ethic. I wish to acknowledge all these outstanding contributors to the Penrith community and beyond.
