        My question is to the Prime Minister. How is the Albanese Labor government continuing to provide cost-of-living relief to Australians, and what measures are being rolled out in the coming months?

        <p>
         I thank the member for her question. Of course our No. 1 priority continues to be easing the cost-of-living pressures which are on families. The news today that we've created some 561,000 jobs since we came to office—a record for any new government—is a part of our objective. The figure of 3.6 per cent unemployment is very welcome. As the Treasurer just said, there have only been 19 times since records began where unemployment has had a '3' in front, and 16 of them have been under this current government.
        </p>
        <p>
         But we're not just about supporting the creation of jobs; we're also about getting wages up. There's nowhere we did that where it's more important than in providing for a pay rise for aged-care workers and the increase in the minimum wage, which we supported.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the first 18 months, we've delivered some $23 billion in measures to take pressure off Australians, through cheaper child care, increased rent assistance, boosting JobSeeker and the single parenting payment, fee-free
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         , building more affordable homes and our energy bill relief plan. In addition to that, today we've introduced legislation for paid parental leave to be expanded to six months—more generous and more flexible, good for families, good for kids and good for our economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         In less than two weeks, the next step in our plan to strengthen Medicare kicks in. Tripling the bulk-billing incentive, helping 11 million Australians see a doctor for free. This historic strengthening of Medicare comes on top of the cheaper medicines plan that we've put in place. Between January and September, the cheaper plan that we put in place has saved Australians $180 million on 16 million scripts, making an enormous difference, and 1 November will be an important day as well with the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive.
        </p>
        <p>
         While we've been doing all of these positive measures, those opposite have continued to just say no to everything, opposing every action we have taken, with nothing positive to offer the country. But we are not deterred. We continue to engage by ensuring that Australians are looked after in what are very turbulent international economic circumstances. We will continue each and every day to work for Australia to make a positive difference.

         <p>
          My question is to the Prime Minister. After less than two months in office, the Prime Minister unveiled a referendum question for the Voice. However, in 18 months, the Prime Minister has failed to deliver the promised reduction in energy prices, failed to deliver the promise of cheaper mortgages and failed to deliver the promise of real wages growth. Why did the Prime Minister prioritise a divisive referendum over Australians struggling with the cost of living?

            The shadow Treasurer, once again, stands up on the day that employment figures are out. You might think there would be a question based upon employment or the economy. Well, once again, no. He speaks about priorities, and what we have had. Well, I'll tell you what our priorities have been, which is what the question goes to.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first priority of any Labor government will always be the creation of jobs, secure jobs. We're not halfway through our first term yet. More jobs created within our first half of our first term than any previous government has ever been responsible for the creation is something that we're very proud of—and, if you compare that, it was 3.6 per cent in September 2023. The participation rate is 66.7 per cent, just down from the highest ever rate, which was produced under us as well. The gender pay gap is 13 per cent, a record low. The number of women employed full time is 3.8 million, a record. Manufacturing jobs: 948,300. The long-term unemployment figures have been reduced by 30,000. Industrial disputes: from 128,000 in the last quarter, when they held office, down to 10,200. And, of course, inflation, which was the highest ever in any quarter in decades under them at 2.1 per cent the March quarter of 2022—the last figures were 0.8 per cent. Annual wage growth: 3.6 per cent compared with 2.4 per cent. Wholesale electricity prices were $264 under them and are now $63.
