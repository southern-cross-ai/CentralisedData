        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister now admit that his industrial relations changes failed to meet the basic test of providing secure jobs and decent pay? Is this why he had to gut his own bill in the Senate today?

         No. The bill—which we continue to seek to see supported, including the measures that the Leader of the Opposition has just referred to—was going to be voted against by the Labor Party. They were opposing the whole bill. They were opposing introducing tougher penalties to deter underpayment of employees. They told us very clearly that they did not want to support these measures. Now they say they do want to support these measures. You know what that sounds like? That sounds like an each-way bet. That sounds like another each-way bet from the Labor Party. They want to oppose it, then they want to support it and then they want to oppose it. It's a game of tennis. What's his next position?

                 The government sought to bring measures into this parliament that would create more jobs. That's what we sought to do. The Labor Party opposed all the measures, including those they now pretend to support. You can't have an each-way bet on this. That's what this leader of the Labor Party is famous for. We will pursue measures through the parliament, and, on a day when Australians have learnt that there are more jobs now in the Australian economy than there were before the pandemic, we're not going to give up on continuing to create even more jobs, even if the Labor Party is not as passionate about creating jobs as the coalition government is—even though it was this government that saw 1½ million jobs created under the policies that we put in place when we came to government. Those jobs that were lost over the course of the COVID pandemic have now returned. There's more work to do, but we will stand up for jobs each and every day. The Leader of the Labor Party and the Labor Party have demonstrated they're against job creation by opposing policies that support job creation.
