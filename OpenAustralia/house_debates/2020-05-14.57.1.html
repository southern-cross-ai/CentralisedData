       <p>
        Next Monday sparks the start of national volunteer week, and this year's theme is changing communities, changing lives. Every day across this country and across my electorate of Forde, countless volunteers are rolling up their sleeves to do exactly that: to change communities and to change lives. Whether it's rolling up their sleeves and putting on the gumboots to clean up after the devastating Logan floods of 2017 or the more recent and pressing challenges of the bushfires and COVID-19, volunteers in my community are there to support others, lend a hand or simply just lend an ear to listen or be a shoulder to cry on.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent times volunteers in Forde have stepped up to help those struggling with the COVID-19 crisis, and I want to acknowledge just some of their efforts in the chamber today. Loganlea Community Centre has been providing free food parcels for families in need. On the Edge Charity in Beenleigh has been doing a weekly free hangi for those in our community doing it tough, and Nightlight has been doing a free takeaway community feed at Beenleigh train station. Beenleigh and Shailer Park Meals on Wheels are ramping up their deliveries for our elderly residents who are isolating, and our service clubs are continuing with their online meetings to keep people connected.
       </p>
       <p>
        The volunteers are the heart and soul of our community and make it a better place to live. I want to thank them for the great work they're doing and the difference they are making in our community.
