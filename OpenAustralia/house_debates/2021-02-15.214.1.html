        The St Mary's Convent Football Club is a passionate and enthusiastic team oriented club. Last week, it was a delight to join the under 13s and under 11s at training on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Road" rel="nofollow">

        playing fields under brand-new lights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Community Development Grants we delivered almost $86,000 to install floodlights over the playing fields, as well as upgrading the surface. Phil, the club secretary, said that this upgrade has made the field 100 per cent better than what it used to be. For the St Mary's Convent Football Club, local cricket clubs and local schools these upgrades enhance safety and open more opportunities for training and competitions at night. Our local sports clubs are such an integral part of our community and play an important role in helping our kids stay healthy and active—something I'm passionate about—to make new friends and to learn lifelong skills. Sharon, the club president, told me how the club had overcome challenges and retained almost all of its players throughout the coronavirus pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also visited the Kingsway Sports Precinct, where joint federal and council investment has delivered floodlighting to allow thousands of players to play safely at night. I would also like to congratulate the clubs there, particularly the touch football and Oztag teams which have volunteered to ensure that our community, players and spectators have kept safe during the coronavirus pandemic. You have all done such a tremendous job.
