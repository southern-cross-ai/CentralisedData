        (3) further notes the damning findings from the Auditor-General including that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) there has been a 510 per cent increase in the average delays for approval decisions since the Liberals and Nationals were elected (between 2014-15 and 2018-19);

       <p class="italic">
        (b) between 2014-15 and 2018-19, delays to environmental approvals for jobs and investment from major projects exploded from 19 days on average to 116 days;

        (5) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the report reveals the extent to which Government cuts to the environment department, which are estimated to be 40 per cent since 2013, has smashed the department's capacity to make good, timely decisions to create jobs and protect the environment; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Government cuts and mismanagement (Liberal party blue-tape) is at the heart of job and investment delays, poor quality decisions and legal challenges; and

        (6) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) take responsibility for their abject failure on the environment and jobs; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) stop tying up projects and strangling the environment with Liberal party blue tape which is delaying jobs and investment, putting a handbrake on our economy, failing to protect iconic Australian species like the koala and allowing the state of our natural environment to rapidly decline.

        1 MR HILL: To move—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) reaffirms that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australians love who they love, and the community must have confidence that the partner and spouse visa provisions in the
        <i>
         Migration Act 1958
        </i>
        (the Act) are administered lawfully, fairly, impartially and with integrity;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) while the Minister generally has the power to limit the number of visas in particular classes and subclasses by using the program management provisions in s86 of the Act, s87 of the Act explicitly prevents the 'capping' of visas to people who apply for a visa on the grounds that they are the spouse or de facto partner of an Australian citizen or permanent resident;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Parliament has voted twice to reject legislative amendments to give the Minister a power to cap these visa classes, preferring the processing of spouse visa applications to occur on a demand-driven basis; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) inexplicable and unconscionable delays by the

        (2) condemns the Government for:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) using the administrative tool of migration program planning levels to unlawfully override the legislated program management tools in s86 and s87 thus effectively 'capping' partner visas against the intent of s87 of the Act;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) refusing to release advice on the legality of their actions to restrict partner visa grants;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) presiding over an extraordinary blow out to 91,717 as at 31 March 2020 in the number of partner visa applications on hand, an increase of almost 30 per cent in under three years;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) unacceptably high and deteriorating processing times for partner visa applications, with the Department's website indicating that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) subclass 300—75 per cent of applications are processed within 16 months and 90 per cent of applications are processed within 29 months;

        (iii) subclass 100—75 per cent of applications are processed within 20 months and 90 per cent of applications are processed within 24 months;

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) apologise for the unacceptable delays in processing partner visa applications and take immediate action to process the backlog noting the Government has collected massive levels of visa application revenue that should be used to process applications in a timely way;

        —That this House notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) the purpose of superannuation is to enable Australians to save for a dignified retirement;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) superannuation has made an enormous contribution to converting Australia from a nation that borrows to a nation that lends, creating a pool of funds to invest locally and abroad;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Australia is the 16th largest economy in the world, but because of universal superannuation has a pool of savings owned by Australian workers worth $2.8 trillion, which is the fourth largest pool of retirement savings in the world;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) before universal superannuation, 68 per cent of Australians and 85 per cent of all women had no retirement savings;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) the average superannuation balance at retirement is now approximately $160,000 for women and $280,000 for men;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) under current policy settings, the median balance on retirement for full-time workers will be $310,819 for women and $628,634 for men;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) over the past decade the average rate of return has been between 6 and 8 per cent—last year it grew by 9.2 per cent and Australia was among only a handful of countries that saw pension fund growth; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8) superannuation is critical to Australia's economic growth and resilience and must be strengthened so it can play a pivotal role in Australia's economic recovery from COVID-19.
