       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the past month the government has introduced into this parliament a suite of bills that represents the most significant overhaul of Australia's maritime industry since its establishment in 1912.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have introduced the national law bill to establish a single national marine safety regulator in Australia and the Navigation Bill that modernises the 100-year-old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Navigation Act
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had the great pleasure to introduce the government's Stronger Shipping for a Stronger Economy legislative reforms.
       </p>
       <p>
        These reforms became law last Thursday and from 1 July commence the vital work of revitalising Australia's shipping industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has also amassed a substantial body of work in protecting Australia's precious marine environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this parliament alone, we have increased penalties for the discharge of oil or oil residues by ships in Australian waters from $220,000 to $11 million; banned the carriage or use of heavy grade oils on ships in the Antarctic area, legislated practices for ship-to-ship transfers of oil carried as cargo and implemented incremental changes to the maximum sulphur level of marine fuel oil.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill continues the government's commitment to our marine environments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to strengthen Australia's comprehensive marine pollution prevention regime.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a government, it is our duty to ensure that our laws for prevention of marine pollution are adequate, up to date and consistent with international law.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Maritime_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         International Maritime Organisation
        </a>
        has adopted a number of conventions which are intended to reduce pollution by ships.
       </p>
       <p>
        The most important of these conventions is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships which is generally referred to as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARPOL" rel="nofollow">
         MARPOL
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        MARPOL has six technical annexes which deal with different aspects of marine pollution.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are pollution by oil, noxious liquid substances in bulk, harmful substances carried by sea in packaged form, sewage, garbage and air pollution.
       </p>
       <p>
        About 150 countries have adopted at least some of these annexes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has adopted all six.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July 2011 the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation adopted amendments to Annex
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
         IV
        </a>
        , V and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VI" rel="nofollow">
         VI
        </a>
        of MARPOL.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main purpose of this bill is to implement those amendments in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments to MARPOL, which will enter into force internationally on 1 January 2013, will:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        This bill will also clarify the application of roll-back provisions in Australia's territorial sea to clarify application of offences committed outside the three-nautical-mile limit.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the bill will repeal the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Act 1998 and the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Act 1998 which relate to the former stevedoring levy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of the stevedoring levy in accordance with the two acts ceased in May 2006 and the two acts are no longer of any effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since coming to power in 2007 this government has significantly improved the protection of Australia's marine environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill continues that work, and I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
