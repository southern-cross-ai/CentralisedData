       <p>
        At about 1.40 pm on 6 August at the Landsdale Primary School early childhood annex, a fire started in a demountable classroom. Fortunately, the children were all evacuated safely, and I acknowledge the great work of teachers and staff who did such a great job that day. By 3 pm the fire brigade had extinguished the fire, and the staff were left to count the cost. All the children's work was lost and all the classroom equipment as well. It was a sad event, but of course the priority was that no-one was injured.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the fire, I am pleased that during the last sitting fortnight my staff and some of my volunteers went along to help cook the barbecue fundraiser that the staff and parents had organised at the school. I am also very pleased that last Saturday, between 7.45 am and 2 pm, I, my wife, Lara, my staff and two of my volunteers, Luke and Nicole, helped out with another barbecue fundraiser sponsored by and out the front of George's hardware store and Artistic Floral, down at the Landsdale Forum shopping centre. I am informed that $1,200 was raised to help replace the decorations and fittings of the classroom for the kindy children.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would mainly, however, like to acknowledge the Landsdale kindy team of Felicity, Heather, Leonie and Nadine and also the many hardworking parents who cooked the food and looked after the raffle that day, led by the dedicated Melissa. I must also acknowledge the outstanding contribution of all the parents who baked cakes, cupcakes, slices and cookies. They sold very well through the day, and people even started arriving during the day asking specifically for Felicity Caratti's cupcakes. Congratulations to the Landsdale kindy staff, the whole team and parents for their outstanding work.
