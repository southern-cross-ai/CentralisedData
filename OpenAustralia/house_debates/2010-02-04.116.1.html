        I take this opportunity to speak of and praise OzHelp WA. Before I do so, I would like to give what I am sure is a common view of the construction industry. Most people who have not worked in that industry would agree that a 7 am start is early but it would be offset by a mid-afternoon finish. The work is heavy and the ability to work at heights would also be required. It would appear that it is fairly well-paid—if not as an apprentice, then once trade qualified they would do pretty well. It is not a bad sort of lifestyle if that is your thing. I have met plenty of apprentices and tradesmen and they often have a healthy disposable income. Overall they seem to be doing pretty well in

        , and that is great.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, however, I was talking to a board member of OzHelp WA who told me that the suicide mortality rates in the construction industry are staggering—75 per cent higher than the average Australian male rate. It has been reported that from 1998 to 2004 the rate of possible suicides was around 43 per 100,000. Contrast that with the 2002 national suicide mortality rate in Australia of 11.8 deaths per 100,000. Clearly there is a need for action to address this terrible statistic. In recognition of this need, in 2002 the OzHelp Foundation was established. OzHelp is an early intervention suicide prevention and capacity-building program designed to address the industry’s needs, particularly given the number of apprentices, trainees and other workers employed in the sector.

        2009 OzHelp WA commenced operations in Western Australia. I would also add that I am very pleased that OzHelp has collocated with the West Australian Group Training Scheme at their premises in Wangara, within my electorate of Cowan. The Chief Executive Officer of OzHelp is Julian Gimpel, who is very well qualified, with degrees in social work, counselling and family therapy. OzHelp is supported by a number of organisations and businesses that have recognised the unique challenges of their industry and the need to look after their workforce. As with OzHelp elsewhere, their focus is about prevention and equipping apprentices and other workers with the skills they need, particularly in terms of self-management and lifestyle.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that OzHelp and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        Julian Gimpel can do the job, but they are constantly challenged by a lack of resources with which to do their work. They are funded in part by industry subsidies and sponsorships, but I would also like to see a federal grant to help OzHelp WA in the same way that OzHelp
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        and Tasmania have received grants in the past. I have written to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        to assist OzHelp WA and to meet with the CEO and a board member so that they can outline the deep needs that we have in Western Australia. I would also say to the minister that, as Western Australia drags this nation back to prosperity, this is the sort of investment that will help maintain the momentum. With a federal grant, OzHelp will be able to extend their programs such as the Life Skills Tool Box, a nationally accredited course assisting apprentices with their confidence through communication, budgeting and dealing with bullying in the workplace, and using 12 four-hour modules to provide the training. The tool box is being piloted in Western Australia with 100 apprentices, including in-class training and on-site field officer support visits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course OzHelp also has a suicide risk identification intervention program, with field officers and supervisors. I understand that OzHelp WA has recently begun working with the ApprentiCentre in Western Australia to provide general awareness training to its entire metro and regional field officer team. I should also mention OzBBQ, the core outreach and follow-up platform for OzHelp WA. Field officers provide free on-site health promotion and awareness-raising activities as well as the food.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have great confidence in OzHelp WA and I know that other members in this place also have confidence in OzHelp in their states and territories. Yet ultimately this good work must be funded. The construction industry is contributing, but, as in other places, there is a need for federal support. I encourage the Minister for Health and Ageing to sit down with OzHelp WA and then support them with a grant. Minister, if you can give them 20 minutes they will come here from Western Australia to see you, and that would be money well spent. I ask for your support.
