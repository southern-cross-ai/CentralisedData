        , driven by a scorching easterly wind. Within minutes, the pall of smoke, ash and raining embers became a serious threat to three local schools.

        I was grateful on Friday to speak with the principals of Hammond Park Primary School, Hammond Park Catholic Primary School and Hammond Park Secondary College. All three principals—Dane Franklin, Andrew Colley and Joanne Willesee—did a fantastic job leading their teachers and staff, engaging with parents and carers and guiding their students to safety in frightening and fast-changing circumstances.

        and was glad for the support from Emmanuel Catholic College next door.

I want to pay tribute to those school leaders and their school communities for staying calm and collected and to
