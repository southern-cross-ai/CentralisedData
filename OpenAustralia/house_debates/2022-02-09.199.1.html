        The Goldstein electorate is a proud one because it is built on the success of its citizens, families and communities coming together to build the foundation of the strength of our nation. Each
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        we honour and celebrate those Australians who have taken responsibility for the wellbeing of not only themselves but our community and our nation as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Goldstein is excited to have 11 local recipients recognised this year in the Australia Day awards, including Mr John Wylie
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        —the highest honour that can be afforded—for eminent service to the community through leadership in the sporting, cultural, philanthropic and business sectors; Dr Mimi Colligan AM for significant service to community history and heritage preservation; Ms Mary Duffy AM for significant service to medicine in the field of lung cancer; Mrs Mary Dawes
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        . Congratulations, Jamie OAM, for your service to local government and to the community of Glen Eira but also, of course, for the incredible work and support you have always provided to one of the communities that enriches the Goldstein social fabric, which is the Jewish community.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was also Ms Jessica Morrison OAM for service to sport as a gold medallist at the

        </a>
        for her service to the community. Individuals create a stronger society through their charity by voluntarily applying their efforts to improve the community as a whole. Those who take that sense of responsibility are the foundation and the strength of our nation. We congratulate Goldstein's Australia Day honour recipients and thank them for their service. In the coming months we will have those for the

        as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to give a big shout-out to Brighton local Brodie Summers, who represented Australia at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. He has already completed. Well done, Brodie, and congratulations on your incredible achievements in getting into international sport—as we have many who participated in the summer Olympics as well. It's an incredible achievement and not just for yourself but for your family and friends who supported you to achieve and realise your dreams. Congratulations on your efforts and best wishes for the future.
