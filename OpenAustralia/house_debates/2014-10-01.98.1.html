         It is a great privilege to answer a question from the member for Casey, who is a great fighter for this project along with the member for Deakin and other colleagues in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, including the Minister for the Environment, who mentioned last week that he should have been included. The member for Aston is fighting for this project as well, as is the member for Dunkley, the Minister for

          Traffic Group

         found that average travel time savings for vehicles using

           how important that signing session was earlier this week. It includes, of course, bike paths as well. There are bike paths as part of the project—a comprehensive investment in bike paths, which I understand the Scooter Appreciation Society has endorsed, as part of the project.

             that was supported by the group of four MPs from the western suburbs of Melbourne because they want the western side done as well, and that is fair enough. I appreciate the passion of the member for Maribyrnong for the western side of this project to be completed, because that too will have huge benefits, as the member for Corangamite argues: benefits to the people of the member for Corio in his electorate and the member for Ballarat in her electorate.
