        I rise this evening to speak on a very important issue in my electorate: fishing. Sadly, fishing in the Territory is under threat and my constituents are not happy. Conservationists are lobbying the federal government to close vast stretches of Territory coastal waters. It is absolutely ridiculous that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Marine_Conservation_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Marine Conservation Society
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMCS" rel="nofollow">
         AMCS
        </a>
        , is trying to establish nine no-go, no-take zones off the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        My colleague in the other place Senator Scullion has already indicated that green groups behind this push will not stop until all waters are covered by no-go zones, and they will destroy both the recreational fishing industry and the very important commercial fishing industry. There is a suggestion by the AMCS that only one per cent of our waters are protected. The fact of the matter is that 100 per cent of our waters are protected under a variety of acts, such as the Northern Territory Marine Act, the Fisheries Act and the Maritime Safety Act, as well as acts on mining in northern maritime waters. It is quite plain to see that there are many layers of protection in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT
        </a>
        waters.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all know that a plan to make areas no-go zones will not work. What it will do is concentrate fishing in other areas and make them unsustainable in the longer term. The coalition's policy at the last election was to put on hold and then restructure the marine bioregional planning process. We will base marine protected areas on science, not just a green take-and-plunder plan So concerned are my constituents they are organizing a rally this Saturday, 5 November, at Stokes Hill Wharf. I have said that I will join the hundreds of very upset fisherman and fisherwomen who are protesting against the proposed no-go zones. Thanks to keen fisherman Clint Jebbink and his friends for offering to take me on their boat.
       </p>
       <p>
        When reporting on the rally last week,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT_News" rel="nofollow">
         NT News
        </a>
        .com.au had a catchy headline, 'Here's some boat people to truly fear'. Rally spokesperson
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davies" rel="nofollow">
         Pete Davies
        </a>
        offered a message to the Prime Minister in relation to the peaceful protest, 'Hey Julia, try stopping these boats'. Pete has indicated that there will be at least 100 boats on the harbour at the one place protesting against the ridiculous proposed no-go zones.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been contacted by hundreds of constituents who all say they are afraid that the Gillard Labor government, after being pressured by the Greens, might have a similar knee-jerk reaction to when they placed a blanket ban on live exports. I would like to share with the House some of what my constituents have said. Chris F of Larrakeyah said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I feel strongly about this because the organization AMCS has not done the necessary investigations before proposing the bans … Recreational fisherman are the eyes on the water particularly here in the NT where there is such a small population and lack of resources to police these types of areas … Living in the NT fishing is a dominant part of our lifestyle and we do it responsibly, adhering the strict bag limits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paul S of Jingili said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am appalled at the unnecessary and unwanted intrusion on the Territory way of life by the AMCS in seeking to close the vast areas of the territory fishing areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luke H of Millner said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We fishermen of the NT have always led the pack in terms of fisheries management and we will continue to. … Fisherman of the NT will happily look at fishing reform when the science supports it but we will not stand by and accept no-go zones especially when the available science does not support it
       </p>
       <p>
        Ted Dunstan said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I cannot imagine anything more likely to kill off the NT hallowed lifestyle. The AMCS's call to the federal government to establish non fishing zones in the top end waters is the mark of abject ignorance of what makes the Territory so special to all who value it. Our boating and fishing is almost sacred. No truer word has been said.

        I would like to use what little time I have left to wish Margot Cox, a constituent of mine, a very happy 80th birthday. Today is her birthday. I spoke with her earlier this evening, and she said she had had a wonderful day and was delighted with having received over thirty calls from well wishers. Margot has lived in the Territory for 60 of those 80 years. She has lived in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Katherine and Darwin. She now lives in Palmerston and is an active member of the Palmerston community. She volunteers her time for a number of organisations. She is a member of the Senior Songsters, who are legendary in the Palmerston area. I wish Margot a very happy birthday.
