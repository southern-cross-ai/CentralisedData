        In positive news for small businesses, families and some critical industries that have been suffering from worker shortages, the government announced that from 1 December large numbers of visas holders will now be able to enter Australia. Our borders are in the process of reopening. From 1 December, if you are double vaccinated with a recognised vaccine you'll be able to enter Australia without an exemption if you are a skilled migrant, international student, working holiday maker, provisional family visa holder, or a tourist or business traveller from Japan, Korea or Singapore.

And we've got an economy that is larger coming out of the pandemic than it was going into the pandemic. We expect around 200,000 new arrivals to come in between December and January. For people in the tourist industry, in the restaurant industry, in the hospitality business, on farms and in agriculture and in any number of businesses, this is welcome news indeed.
