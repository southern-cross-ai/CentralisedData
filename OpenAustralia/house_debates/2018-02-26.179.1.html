       <p>
        I wish to report to the House an outstanding achievement by one of my local schools, Livingstone
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_College" rel="nofollow">
         Christian College
        </a>
        . It was founded in 2002, and some areas of the college previously ranked in the bottom two per cent of schools in Queensland. But not anymore. Last week it was reported to the school that it has gone from—in some aspects—the bottom two per cent of the state to now ranking in the top 44 per cent of all schools in Queensland. That is an outstanding achievement that is worthy of recognition here in parliament. Livingstone Christian College managed a Herculean effort in climbing 165 places in the school rankings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Results like this are the combination of hard work by students, teachers, parents and the local community, all working together with a common purpose. That shared common purpose and striving to do better have seen the school rapidly improve on the National School Improvement Tool, and I've heard reports that many within the department have never seen a school improve that quickly. Its prep reading levels are now off the charts. It's been said that it takes a village to raise a child, and that village right now is the school community of the Livingstone Christian College. They can be proud of what they've done.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to give special mention to the principal, Mark Laraghy, for his leadership in striving to turn the school's fortunes around. He has done an outstanding job with an outstanding group of teachers, and they, the families and the students should justifiably be extraordinarily proud. Congratulations to Livingstone Christian College.
