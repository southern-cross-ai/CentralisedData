       <p>
        I rise in this House tonight to proudly extend my best wishes to the many members of the Australian community of proud Indian heritage and those from my electorate of Holt who, on Monday, 15 August 2011, celebrated the 64th anniversary of India's independence from British rule. On that day in 1947 India became a sovereign nation. When India achieved independence, India's first Prime Minister, Mr Nehru, spoke to the nation. He asked the nation one important question on the first day India became a free country. He asked: are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future? From any objective assessment, India has grasped the opportunity and claimed its birthright.
       </p>
       <p>
        India's economic development, along with its emergence in key institutions like the G20 and other elements of the global political and economic architecture, is testament to the spirit of the people of India, their vibrant optimism, their desire for social prosperity and economic development and for opportunity for their country and their children. The Indian economy is growing at approximately eight per cent. The economic boom has translated into opportunities for its citizens in the way of new infrastructure and industries and has improved the lives of many Indian citizens. India has been one of the fastest-growing large economies since 1994. Indian economic engagement with the rest of the world has increased, particularly in the services sector. It is apparent that the spirit of the people of India still moves people within the country to fight for change, changes that they want to see in their country and in the world. And at this time of profound change and hope for millions of people, India's story stands as a powerful example of what people can achieve through the peaceful pursuit of human, political and social rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has a very broad and deep relationship with India based on our common interests and shared commitment to democracy, pluralism, human rights and the rule of law. The relationship that exists between our countries is one characterised not only by flourishing trade but profound cultural and social exchange. In 2009, for example, the then Prime Minister Rudd announced a major boost in funding over five years for joint science and technology research projects. This included $50 million that will be matched by India for the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund to support joint research in some of the grand challenges facing the two countries, like energy, food and water security.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is no secret—and I proudly say this—that Australia welcomes a growing number of migrants, students and visitors from India. They are part of the past, present and future of this nation. In our past, Indian crews from the

        are believed to have come to Australia on trading ships soon after 1788 and others came later, in the 1800s. These members of the Indian community were vital in the early exploration of inland Australia and in the establishment of service and communication links. Today well over 300,000 people of Indian heritage are making an invaluable contribution to Australia's economic and social prosperity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am continually amazed at the vibrant culture that the Indian community has brought to Australia. In particular it has been heartening to see how the Indian community has enriched the local community in my electorate. They have left an indelible mark on areas in and around my electorate like the

        Temple and the Indian Quarter in Dandenong, home of many Indian restaurants and Indian cultural organisations. I visited the Hindu Shri Shiva Vishnu temple in Carrum Downs earlier this year for the Holi Festival. This temple was built by Hindu community members from India,

        </a>
        . The building itself is a monumental piece of architecture, a credit to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the great triumphs of the Australian experience is to allow people from every corner of the earth to make this place their home and to share their cultures with their fellow Australians in this country in an atmosphere of mutual respect, tolerance and shared understanding. This was made very clear to me during the Week of Nations that took place at the Courtenay Gardens Primary School on Friday, 29 July 2011. That is where they had a parade of nations, and the acceptance that members of the Indian community had from that particular community was very clear.
