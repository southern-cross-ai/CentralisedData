           I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member, I am sure, would recall very clearly the numerous occasions on which he has said how important it is to defend the independent umpire and the decisions of the Fair Work Commission, and how he railed against the policy of the Greens, echoed by his leader, the member for Maribyrnong. They railed against the Greens for suggesting that parliament could interfere with decisions of the Fair Work Commission. Having a long and distinguished career in the union movement, the honourable member would often say what a fundamental issue and principle it was for the Labor Party to defend the independent umpire in setting wages and conditions. But not any longer, because now—

             in line with the new ideological leader of the labour movement, Sally McManus, the law should be followed by unions only when it suits them. So, the law is optional for trade unions, apparently. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
              CFMEU
             </a>
             has always had that approach. And we brought them back, under the rule of law, with the restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, and we will bring out all of those shonky payments, all of those secret payments, some of which have been listed here and many of which went to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers'_Union" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Workers' Union
             </a>
             —mysterious payments about which the Leader of the Opposition is so proud. And that distinguished advocate the member for Isaacs has said—speaking, I am sure, for all of the members opposite—how proud they all are about the advocacy and leadership by the Leader of the Opposition in the Australian Workers' Union, which involved the union receiving payments from one employer after another but never bothering to tell the members about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wonder why that was? Why were those payments hidden? Was it because they did not want to trouble the equanimity of the members of the union? I do not think so. I think is was because they knew there was something wrong. People who have nothing to hide do not hide anything. What the Leader of the Opposition did, what the union bosses did, was set out to hide those payments. They hid them from view.
