       <p>
        I would like to address an important issue in my community: the very poor mobile phone coverage in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connells_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Connells Point
        </a>
        area. In seeking a solution for residents on this matter, I have discussed the issue on several occasions with Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. I want to congratulate Vodafone and Optus for the constructive approach they have taken on this issue. Following on from discussions with the companies, Vodafone recently submitted a plan to Kogarah City Council to install an additional mobile antenna in the area. That plan has been approved and the antenna is expected to be up and running early next year, which is expected to significantly improve mobile phone reception coverage for Vodaphone and Optus customers. I commend those companies on their efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        In contrast to the responsive actions of Vodafone and Optus, Telstra's lack of action on this issue continues to be a source of immense frustration. I have had numerous meetings and many conversations with Telstra over the issue of very poor mobile coverage in the Connells Point area, dating back to November last year. The simple fact, however, is that Telstra has done nothing to address the needs of its customers in the area. Telstra has not provided any plan on how it will address the reception issues, despite the fact that Vodafone and Optus have been able to do so. It is clear from the actions of Vodafone and Optus that it is commercially possible to address this problem, but Telstra has failed to act. I believe it should act and I will continue to advocate on behalf of residents on this important issue.
