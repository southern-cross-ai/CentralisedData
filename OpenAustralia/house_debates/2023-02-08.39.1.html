        The

        and its mind-boggling bureaucracy dominates the lives of many members of the Goldstein community. Reapplying for packages and finding the right care have combined to become a full-time job for carers and people with disabilities trying to engage with the system. Therefore, I was pleased that the Minister for the NDIS and Minister for Government Services,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        , took the time last week to visit Goldstein to participate in a public forum to engage directly with our community. As the minister told the full room, there is an NDIS review underway that will report towards the end of the year, but feedback received now can be folded into the system. Through this direct engagement the system will be improved—it must be—and only then will support for what is a costly but much needed service be maintained.

        The minister also join me in a session with

        music therapy, which supports people with neurodevelopmental disabilities making music together. Unlike most allied health professionals, music therapists are subject to

        under the NDIS, which cuts into users' funds. This, I would argue, should change. It was appreciated by all the participants that the minister took the time to implement change based on their real-world experience. Thanks to all those who came.
