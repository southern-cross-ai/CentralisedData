       <p>
        On Friday last week, I had the absolute pleasure of meeting the grade 5 students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cross_Catholic_College" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Cross Catholic College
        </a>
        , MacKillop Campus, and their teacher, Jo Donohoe. The students had written to me with suggestions on how to best upgrade the Rothwell roundabout, a local traffic hotspot in my electorate. I want to thank the grade 5 students from class 5B for their contribution to this important discussion. They had been working on the project for more than six weeks and I was very impressed with their intelligent analysis of the issue. The class invited me to also have a good look at the models they had made with their parents and in the class. Many of them had spent many hours on it. The results were that 16 of the students in 5B said an overpass was the way to go, three said traffic lights were the way to go, three said extra lanes were the way to go, two said tunnels were the way to go—we should tunnel under the roundabout—and one said, 'Forget all that. We just need a lollipop man.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rothwell roundabout, whilst it is a major responsibility of the state, I am talking to the Deputy Prime Minister about how the federal government can help. I received a whole lot of letters, which are all here, from the class. Amy Bird said tunnels were the way to go. Casey Clarke said traffic lights were not the way to go; she thought an overpass was. And Jai Dunlop said traffic lights were the best solution. It was very important. Thank you, 5B.
