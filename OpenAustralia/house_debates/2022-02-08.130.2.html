        I want to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Secret Harbour
        </a>
        Surf Life Saving Club on celebrating its 40th anniversary. With Perth sweating through one of its hottest summers on record, I, alongside many others in my electorate of Brand, have flocked to our beautiful beaches. The Secret Harbour Surf Life Saving Club has done a remarkable job keeping us all safe. The club performs over 6,000 patrols and 300 rescues annually. As well as monitoring approximately 35 kilometres of the Rockingham coastline, the club patrols

        </a>
        during the very busy and very hectic abalone season, ensuring the safety of those hunting for that exotic treasure.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud to say that the club was recognised in the 2021 Surf Life Saving WA Awards of Excellence, with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Williams" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        winning Trainer of the Year and Nicholas Graydon winning Youth Lifesaver of the Year. While I would love to congratulate these exemplary members in person at the club's celebration of its 40th anniversary on 19 February, I, unfortunately, cannot attend due to quarantine and isolation requirements on my return home, but I sincerely hope everyone has a brilliant time and quite rightly celebrates this club's great success. The club is always looking for new members and volunteers. I encourage everyone to get involved and show their support.

        Another club in Brand that's making me incredibly proud is the Secret Harbour Dockers Cricket Club. This weekend they join cricket clubs around Australia in hosting a Pink Stumps Day to raise money for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGrath_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         McGrath Foundation
        </a>
        . The day will start with a warm-up game between the Secret Harbour men's team and the Wanachote Wanderers, which is a team made up of players from clubs around Perth who come together a few times a year to play Peel based teams and raise funds for cancer research. I guess it's good that a few people get south of the river sometimes. The Secret Harbour Dockers will then take on the Warnbro Swans in the T20 ladies game.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both teams will play for the inaugural Madeleine King MP Trophy. It will become an annual competition between the two neighbouring clubs. I love cricket enormously, so I am enormously grateful to have a trophy in my name for these two great clubs to compete for. I really wish I could be there this weekend, but I will be in Canberra. If you livestream it, maybe I will get to watch it back here. Good luck to both teams. I can't wait to see next year's game.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secret Harbour Football Club player and breast cancer survivor Amy Duckworth will present the trophy to the winning team. Amy, it's really disappointing that I won't be there with you. Hopefully, next year I can get along and take part in the fun, but I can't promise to bowl or bat, because I just like watching.
       </p>
