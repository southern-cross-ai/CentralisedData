        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Week, a time to celebrate the history and culture of our Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        peoples. I would like to use this opportunity during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC_Week" rel="nofollow">
         NAIDOC Week
        </a>
        to acknowledge a wonderful elder from my community, Poppy Harry Mundine Walker. Poppy Harry is a greatly respected senior elder. Born in 1940, he has spent his life sharing stories about his family history to ensure younger generations know and understand Aboriginal culture.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few year ago he was involved in a film project that captured the stories and history of the Tabulam area. They created six
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" rel="nofollow">
         DVD
        </a>
        s to be used by schools as an educational resource. Harry has also been involved in workshops across Bundjalung country, with the aim of ensuring these stories are passed on to future generations. Importantly, he does great work at Tabulam Public School, teaching language and culture lessons and taking students on excursions. He is also an ordained

         Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Poppy Harry has lived in Tabulam all his life with his wife Annabel. Their children, Steven, Marty, Tony, Donny, Vanessa and Janine, and his many grandchildren also live in the area. Poppy Harry has many brothers and sisters, including John, Bow, George, Gloria, Francis, Peter and Lewis. It is an extensive list.
       </p>
       <p>
        Poppy Harry is also an extremely proud descendant of Harry Joseph Mundine. This is his great-great grandfather. Harry Joseph Mundine was born in 1860. He was an outstanding horseman and an outstanding athlete. Many people would know General Sir Henry George Chauvel. He was also born in Tabulam and was appointed to command the 1st Light Horse Brigade. Chauvel asked Harry to mentor his children, teaching them horsemanship and an understanding of Aboriginal and Christian beliefs. This was a highly symbolic position at the time. Harry is still known by many as one of the first people to recognise the value of reconciliation, and was a great example of how both cultures can work together successfully. Harry Mundine married Aboriginal Queen Ponjam, and it is through this line that the Walkers are descended. Their home was originally known as the 'big house' and was where many of the children were born.
       </p>
       <p>
        Poppy Harry and Harry Mundine have incredible stories. It is wonderful to acknowledge them this week in this place for the community leaders that they were and are.

         admirably fought for a nation that, sadly, refused to acknowledge their existence.

         . His legacy is profound and it reminds us that history matters. Indeed, in recent years, we have seen a commendable effort from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         , an institution conceived by Bean, to cast a light on these untold stories. Last year, it was a privileged to be at the dedication of the Aboriginal and

        </p>
        <p>
         Revealing the true history of our nation and challenging a once accepted view of our war service is critical. Truth-telling across all parts of our story is critical. Over a thousand
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         fought in the First World War. They came from a section of society with few rights, low wages and poor living conditions. Most Indigenous Australians could not vote and none were counted in the census. Many Indigenous Australians denied their Aboriginality and kinship to enlist, serve, fight, suffer and die for the nation that had taken so much from them.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to mention some of these First Nations soldiers that served Australiaâ€”soldiers such as Private Richard Martin, who served with the 47th Infantry Battalion in France, was wounded three times, yet continued to fight on. In order to serve, Private Martin lied about his ancestry, claiming to be born in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         â€”in truth, hailing from Queensland. Private Martin was finally killed in March 1918. Then there was Corporal Harry Thorpe. Born in Victoria, Thorpe enlisted and set sail from Melbourne in 1916 before joining up with the 7th Battalion in France. During operations near Ypres in 1917, Corporal Thorpe demonstrated conspicuous courage and leadership, being awarded the military medal and receiving a promotion.
        </p>
        <p>
         They were men who endured the same hardship, chaos and tribulation as their fellow soldiers, yet for decades, as we revered the sacrifice of others, they remained banished to the shadows of history. Unfortunately, despite Indigenous Australians serving on equal terms, after the war, in areas such as education, employment and freedom, Aboriginal ex-service men and women found their discrimination remained or, indeed, had worsened during the war period. They fought shoulder-to-shoulder with their mates in the muddy trenches of
