        I would like to pay tribute to Terry Tindale, a constituent and former southern New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">
         MUA
        </a>
        branch secretary and legend of the Illawarra seafaring industry, who passed away last Monday after a long battle with illness. Terry first went to sea on 16 April 1947; he was only 14 years of age. He soon developed an enormous reputation for his seafaring skills and political and industrial commitment. He worked aboard many ships during his long career, most famously working on the iron boats the

        and the
        <i>
         Iron Yampi
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Terry's achievements were legendary on the iron boats and in the land of the 'long red cloud', the name he gave to his home town,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kembla" rel="nofollow">
         Port Kembla
        </a>
        . He was also famous for his involvement in the South Coast Labour Council and as the official and branch secretary of the MUA. No problem was ever too big or small to take to Terry. No matter what it was, he was always happy to sit down and have a yack and make sure his men were well looked after. He was particularly proud of his grandson Ben, who followed his grandfather to sea and is a respected, active trade unionist and is known as an esteemed delegate. There are no two ways about itâ€”Terry has left an indelible mark on the Illawarra seafaring landscape. My thoughts are with his wife Annette and three daughters Renay, Tracey and my colleague Danielle and their families at home. Vale Terry Tindale. You will be sadly missed mate.
