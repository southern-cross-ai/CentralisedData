        Following comments made by health minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Dutton
        </a>
        , on the
        <i>

          ABC News Breakfast
         </a>

        program yesterday morning, I would like to clarify that at no stage during my time as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker of the House of Representatives
        </a>
        did I ever use or make the Speaker's office available for party political fundraisers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking to host
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rowland" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Rowland
        </a>
        , Mr Dutton suggested that the practice of holding political fundraisers in the Speaker's office has been commonplace for many Speakers. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I think the Speaker has, as is the case with previous Speakers, conducted these sort of events not at taxpayers expense and I think that is appropriate â€¦
       </p>
       <p>
        This statement is false and misleading. I and my Labor predecessor never used the Speaker's office for party political fundraising. To do so would have been highly inappropriate. The only functions held in the Speaker's office during my time as Speaker were for the purposes of official business and the annual Christmas drinks for members of parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        When pressed to nominate a Speaker who had held a fundraiser in the Speaker's office, Mr Dutton could not, simply stating:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I can't rule out that past speakers haven't done it because it is common practice across both parties across the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        If Mr Dutton has any doubts about the conduct of previous Speakers then I am happy to clarify. He can rule out the possibility of political fundraisers previously being held in the Speaker's office during the previous Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The office of the Speaker is bequeathed by the parliament and the Australian people. It is not an institution owned by the government of the day or a political party; it belongs to the parliament and to the people. The independence of the office of the Speaker is paramount to the dignity and respect which that office holds. Maintaining this independence was my guiding principle and governed every decision I made.
