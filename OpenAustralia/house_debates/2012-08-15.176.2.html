        and gone north again. Since then no ship had called: not a word, not an observation, for seventeen years, each one of which was exactly like the thousands that had preceded it, locked in its historical immensity of blue heat, bush, sandstone and the measured booming of glassy Pacific rollers.

        Stirring stuff, wonderfully woven—there is nothing better than excellent writing. It compels you to read on and on. This book is one of those you cannot put down, even though it is a weighty tome. It tells the tale of the brutal transportation of men, women and children from Georgian Britain—and being a staunch advocate for the Australian Republican movement, Hughes would probably prefer that to '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" rel="nofollow">
         Great Britain
        </a>
        '—into a harsh, cruel, penal system. This was the origin of modern Australia.

        Published in 1987,
        <i>
         The Fatal Shore
        </i>
        was a prize-winning epic and a No. 1 international bestseller. I know Hughes's works are immensely enjoyed by the many book clubs throughout the Riverina and are regularly borrowed from regional libraries. Hughes contributed much more than just this cleverly crafted account of the historical, political and sociological reasons which prompted British settlement of our great country.

        died on 6 August, aged 74 years. He was an iconic art critic, author and maker of television documentaries. The member for Wentworth, husband of Hughes's niece Lucy, did marvellous justice to Hughes's well lived life in our parliament yesterday. We pay condolences to those Robert Hughes has left behind. We mourn his passing and we thank him for the extraordinary gift he left us in the form of his works, which will be read, reread and treasured for as long as the written word endures.

         series, three wives. The member for Wentworth yesterday in the House spoke on Robert Hughes's passing with wonderful eloquence, as he so often does. I suggested to him afterwards we should create a post of parliamentary eulogist and make it his in permanence.
        </p>
        <p>
         So many aspects of Robert Hughes's life could attract mention today:

         </i>
         , or his tome on Barcelona, which was an extraordinary piece of work. But I want to focus today on his role as an art critic—I think the leading art critic of a generation—because it was in that capacity that he so much inspired me. It has been noted that Robert Hughes became an art critic by accident. In 1958 he was working as a cartoonist in Sydney for the fortnightly magazine the
         <i>
          Observer
         </i>
         , then edited by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Horne" rel="nofollow">
          Donald Horne
         </a>
         . He recounted that Horne had sacked the magazine's art critic and snapped at Hughes, 'You're the cartoonist—you ought to know something about art.' And so a career began.
        </p>
        <p>
         Robert Hughes was himself an artist, not of the ranks of those whose work he analysed but enough to know something of the craft. In an interview with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Craven" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Craven
         </a>
         , Craven described Robert Hughes's own creative work in the following words:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         He's pleased that he knows enough about making things to appreciate greatness when he sees it, and to understand the sheer difficulty of creating something that looks simple.
        </p>
        <p>
         He left Australia in the 1960s. His friend the writer
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Moorehead" rel="nofollow">
          Alan Moorehead
         </a>
         counselled: 'If you stay here another 10 years, Australia will still be a very interesting place, but you will have become a bore, a village explainer.' So off he headed, first to Europe and then to the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         His tongue could be sharp.
         <i>
          American Visions
         </i>
         , I think possibly his greatest work, contains some examples of where he could take on those who displeased him. In writing of the work of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Newman" rel="nofollow">
          Barnett Newman
         </a>
         , he said the following:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         At one point Newman said, with a straight face, 'I thought our quarrel was with Michelangelo.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Hughes's deadpan reply:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It was not a quarrel anyone could win with a stripe.
        </p>
        <p>
         Speaking of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schnabel" rel="nofollow">
          Julian Schnabel
         </a>
         , one of his great nemeses, Hughes described him as 'a roundly self-admiring painter who once compared himself to Duccio, Giotto and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh" rel="nofollow">
          Van Gogh
         </a>
         —not very close and no cigar'. Schnabel was 'a perfect painter for a culture of replays'.
        </p>
        <p>
         But for those whose work he loved he wrote in glowing terms. Writing of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian_Freud" rel="nofollow">
          Lucian Freud
         </a>
         , he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Every inch of the surface has to be won, must be argued through, bears the traces of curiosity and inquisition — above all, takes nothing for granted and demands active engagement from the viewer as its right.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of Goya he wrote his genius lay in his 'vast breadth of curiosity about the human animal and the depth of his appalled sympathy for it'. Of Caravaggio he wrote:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Caravaggio was one of the hinges of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_History" rel="nofollow">

         and perhaps one of those who will pick up Hughes's mantle, wrote:

        <p class="italic">
         Robert Hughes, more than any other critic, played an enormous role in converting people to take pleasure in it and to be discerning about it, rather than to feel that sense of suspicion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sebastian Smee pointed out that Hughes helped to create a sense of enjoyment of modern art, 'to make many of us feel that we could approach it and like it and, most importantly, not like it'. As the

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I had known Robert Hughes since the mid-70s and will miss his eloquent, thought-provoking writing and commentary on Australian art in a national and international context.
        </p>
        <p>
         He touched so many Australians through his writing. His great work, particularly on the fine arts, will live on for decades and perhaps centuries to come.
