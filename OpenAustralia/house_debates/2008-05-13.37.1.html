        Mr Speaker, I had the privilege of attending the

         Parliament House
        </a>
        20th anniversary celebrations here last Saturday. I ask if you could advise the House of the contribution made by the staff of the parliament which I believe helped to ensure such a successful public occasion and such an important one?

         I am ashamed to indicate that the member for Canberra did tip me off about this earlier in question time!

         briefly, and importantly, say that there were a series of events last Friday and Saturday to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the opening of this building, which is often described as ‘new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         ’ by locals but is ‘Parliament House’ to most of the nation. The purpose and the theme of the celebrations was to commemorate the contribution of those who were involved in the design and construction of the building. As the member for Canberra has indicated, it was a very successful occasion. It included an open day on the Saturday at which there were—I have seen one report say—8,000 people, but I was not out there counting them. I think that it is quite proper for us to congratulate all those from the parliamentary departments who were involved in what was a very successful occasion. The feedback from those who were involved in design and construction was that they felt that it was a very suitable way in which we commemorated the 20th anniversary of the opening of this place.
