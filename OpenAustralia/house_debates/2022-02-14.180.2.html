        I rise to congratulate the Australian winter Olympic team on their fantastic achievements in Beijing to date.

        aren't over yet, but from an Australian perspective they've already had the most successful winter games ever. I congratulate Jakara Anthony, Scotty James, Jackie Narracott and Tess Coady, who have been amongst the medallists. We still have seven days to go. There are amazing athletes still competing, including Warringah's very own Sami Kennedy-Sim, who is competing in her third

        . I wish Sami the best of luck in the women's ski cross on Thursday. She has overcome great adversity, including injuries and a stroke in 2013. She is a proud ambassador of the national Stroke Foundation. She raises awareness of strokes in young people.

        The Australian winter Olympic team has come a long way since I first competed as a 17-year-old in Albertville in 1992. The team has nearly doubled in size and now more than half of the team are women. I congratulate all the athletes for making it to the Olympic Games. I wish the athletes the best of luck for the events still to come. I remind people that, by supporting the Australian team overseas, you are supporting Australians who are doing their very best. They really should make us all feel very proud. Whether it's summer or winter Olympics, they do need support. I remind the government that funding of sport is essential for that message of health and wellbeing to our communities.
