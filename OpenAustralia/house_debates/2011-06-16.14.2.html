        . It is currently an operating airfield used mostly by civilian aircraft. An area of Point Cook which was formerly used for firefighting training has been identified as a source of contamination. Firefighting training at the site required the use of a range of flammable chemicals to ignite and extinguish old aircraft. A number of known carcinogens and other contaminants toxic to humans and the environment have been identified as being present in the soil and discharging via groundwater to Port Phillip Bay. Remediation is required to ensure the protection of human health and to include the quality of the groundwater and the Port Phillip Bay marine environment. This can only be achieved by reducing the contamination concentrations entering the groundwater. The estimated turnout cost of the proposed works is $23 million plus

        Scottsdale facility is vital to maintaining the nutritional and health status of Australian troops because it provides food and feeding regimes which enhance performance. The works will include the redevelopment of food technology facilities, upgrades to existing chemistry and nutrition laboratories and improvements to site infrastructure and working areas. The redevelopment will result in a modern food science facility equipped to meet the future nutritional needs of ADF personnel. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $18.7 million plus GST. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence late this year and be completed by late 2013. I commend the motion of the House.
