       <p>
        I recently had the honour of attending an event that was really a red-letter day for our Cairns Men's Shed. I can now proudly say the funding has been delivered, the contract is well and truly signed and the shed is now owned by its members. Cairns Men's Shed has come a long way, in leaps and bounds, for the past few years and is widely regarded as one of the best sheds in our region. In fact, it's the only shed in Australia where the members fully own the land on which and the building in which they operate. I can honestly say that it makes me immensely proud to have played a role in delivering this outcome for such an amazing community organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to personally thank the Cairns Men's Shed president, Bob Lavington, and his board for their passion and for their dedication in securing this fantastic community asset for generations to come. I'd also like to acknowledge past presidents Clive Lee and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_King" rel="nofollow">
         John King
        </a>
        , as well as the many local businesses who donated their services to achieve this amazing outcome for members of the community. Finally, I'd like to make special mention of Bob's wife, Beth Lavington, who worked tirelessly behind the scenes, making sense of the layers of bureaucracy and ensuring that all the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed.
       </p>
       <p>
        To everyone involved in the men's shed, I'd like to say: job very, very well done. Now I have to say to you that, with these things, one job finishes and another's ready to start. I think it's about time we started to look at the car park!
