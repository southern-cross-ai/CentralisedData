       <p>
        I am delighted to participate in the adjournment debate and recognise the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ocean_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Great Ocean Road
        </a>
        marathon that was held on Sunday, 20 May. As you would be aware, Mr Speaker, the Great Ocean Road becomes part of the Corangamite electorate—that is, the main part—and the secondary part is in the electorate of Wannon. I acknowledge the fantastic work that the organisers of the Great Ocean Road marathon have done.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the third event and it now attracts 2,000 competitors. Hopefully it will become an icon of marathon running around the world. The scenery, the atmosphere and the general arrangements surrounding the Great Ocean Road marathon foreshadow the possibilities of it being up with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        , London and Paris marathons and some of the other well-known marathons here in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge Ross Stephens and his committee from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Apollo Bay
        </a>
        who thought up the original idea that we run a marathon from Lorne to Apollo Bay and that the weekend be devoted to runners participating in a number of events. They put their money on the line and they have been part of organising the event. I also acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Craven" rel="nofollow">
         John Craven
        </a>
        , who was the event manager.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had two events, the half marathon of 21 kilometres plus two kilometres to finish in Apollo Bay and the full marathon from Lorne to Apollo Bay. The organisers encouraged world recognised athletes from Kenya to join them. David Mutua won the marathon. He was supported by those well-known Australian marathoners
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Moneghetti" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Troop" rel="nofollow">
         Lee Troop
        </a>
        . Steve Moneghetti has been a great supporter of this event, he has been a participant and he has been prepared to support the organisers, as has Lee Troop. We had, as I said, 2,000 competitors in both those events. I think the hero of the event was Dr Lloyd Morgan. He competed in the half marathon last year, and this year, at the age of 77, he participated in the full marathon. Dr Morgan used to run in the old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunlop_Volleys" rel="nofollow">
         Dunlop Volleys
        </a>
        and I suggested he should get a better pair of shoes but this year he trained up and he finished the full marathon in, I think, about five hours and 20 minutes. That is a magnificent performance and shows the sort of participation that the runners have in this very important event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge PETstock, who have been a sponsor. Obviously the organisers are looking for other sponsors to support this wonderful event. Barry and Keith Fagg from Mitre 10 also sponsored the event. Mr Barry Fagg competed in the half marathon and his brother Keith completed yet another full marathon, having competed in the Berlin and Paris marathons. I competed in the third event and was able to achieve a finisher’s medal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was accompanied by my friend from the other side the minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Holding" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Holding
        </a>
        . He competed in the full marathon, the member opposite would be pleased to know. I do not have his time here but he did a fantastic job and he was supported by the Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bracks" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Bracks
        </a>
        , as he went past Steve Bracks’s holiday house. As I say, Tim Holding was delighted that the Premier was supporting him halfway through the marathon. I was lucky enough to complete the half marathon in two hours 14 minutes, seven minutes longer than last year and, of course, you have to do another two kilometres to the centre of Apollo Bay.
       </p>
       <p>
        I conclude by saying that this Great Ocean Road marathon could become a world event. The organisers are getting ready for next year. They are looking for sponsors. I have put a submission to the federal government to help in this event. It is going to become a world-class event and they are to be commended because of the way in which they have been entrepreneurs. They started the event and it goes from success to success.
