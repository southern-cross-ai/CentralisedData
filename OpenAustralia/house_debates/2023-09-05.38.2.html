Does the Prime Minister still maintain that the Uluru statement is just one page and that any suggestions otherwise are conspiracy theory and nonsense?

           ! Wait until they find them! They are out there somewhere! There's a 10-minute bagpipe solo in there; it goes on and on and on. We had in that question that it's 200 pages. Then we had it as 20 pages. Yesterday on the front page of the paper it was 15 pages.

           Dialogues emphasising that reform needed to be substantive and structural include: Hobart, Broome, Darwin, Perth, Sydney,

           The document quotes the reports from individual dialogue meetings. For example, they cite the reflections of the participants in the Perth dialogue:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We have learnt through the leaders of the Pilbara Strike, we have learnt from the stories of our big sisters, our mothers, how to be proud of who we are.

           In the lead-up to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, there were hundreds of meetings involving thousands of Indigenous people. This process was set up under the former government, meeting at Uluru in 2017 to agree to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which I table—the one-page document. I know full well that Megan Davis has made it very clear that the Uluru statement is one page. What we have here is a whole range of meeting minutes, effectively, of the hundreds of meetings that took place in the lead-up to Uluru, because it was well thought through. And they came up with a gracious 440 word statement. Just like the words that are in the question before the Australian people—they are very clear and succinct as well. But those opposite don't want to talk about them; they want to talk about everything but. They say that people are confused, but that they try to add to every bit of confusion with 'what ifs?' and utter untruths that they know are totally untrue. That is why
