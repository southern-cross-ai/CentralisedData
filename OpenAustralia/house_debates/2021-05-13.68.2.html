        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the government has spent almost half a million dollars to intervene in the Rossato High Court case in support of ripping away pay from long-term workers in insecure work? Why is the Prime Minister spending taxpayer money to cut the wages of insecure workers, including Queensland miners in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowen_Basin" rel="nofollow">

         I thank the member for his question. It's on the matter that went to the great uncertainty that arose in relation to the definition of casuals in the workplace that, if unresolved, could have seen job losses and loss of investment, and the loss of confidence in our economy at a time in the middle of the worst global recession we have seen since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
          Great Depression
         </a>
         —a global recession 30 times worse than the global financial crisis. Uncertainty at any time, when it comes to these types of issues, needs to be addressed and needs to be resolved so that we can ensure that businesses invest and people get into work and people get into jobs.

         Prior to entering into the pandemic, Australia had already achieved, since the government was first elected, some 1.5 million people coming into work. We knew that we went into the pandemic, and when we went into the pandemic some 900,000, or thereabouts, Australians lost their jobs and another 300,000—and, indeed, more—had their hours reduced to zero. But we now know, on the other side of the pandemic, there are more people in work today than there were before the pandemic. Certainty—

               The Leader of the Opposition has made his point of order. I say to the Prime Minister: the question was fairly specific certainly in the first part that was asked. But even in the broader part at the end I don't think it allows you to move beyond the issue of wages.

                The Australian people know the Labor Party are no friend of coalminers. They are no friend of the workers in the resources industry. They are no friend of the workers in the construction industry. They opposed the HomeBuilder program. They bagged it. They rubbished it. They on that side are no friends of workers. The friends of workers are on this side, because it is this side of the House which has been creating jobs for the Australian people. We acted to ensure certainty to enable Australians to get employed, and that is what this government is about—getting Australians into work. When we took the measures through this House and the other place, the Labor Party saw workers' rights as collateral damage for their own political purposes as they voted against important improvements for those to be supported in casual work. They thought that politics was more important than workers. So I am not going to be lectured by a Labor Party whose form in this House is to oppose jobs for workers, particularly in the resources sector. Give us a break!
