        My question is to the Prime Minister. Why does the Prime Minister always choose the worst and weakest policy option on climate change? Is it because, as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        has said, there is a significant percentage of his government that does not believe climate change is real? Is this why Malcolm Turnbull is no longer Prime Minister?

        <p>
         The weakest and worst option for the Australian economy is the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         . That is the weakest and worst option. I can advise the House that that is based on their form, when they have been in governmentâ€”'Captain Risky' over there, when it comes to the Australian economy. That is the risk that the Labor Party poses to our economy and all of what we're able to achieve, in terms of funding the essential services that Australians rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
         I notice the hubris, which I'm hearing from the member for Eden-Monaro. He's out there. He's all cocky. He's walking around his electorate. He thinks it's all over, bar the shouting. But I can assure the member for Eden-Monaro: you are in for a very big fight, because the Australian people do not want $200 billion of higher taxes on them in the mortgage belt of Queanbeyan or down the south coast of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . You're going to rip thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars out of the pockets of the retirees who are all throughout your electorate. The member for Eden-Monaro is a risk to his own constituents when it comes to the taxes that he seeks to impose on them.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can assure the Labor Party members opposite that on this side of the House we are going to fight for a stronger economy, we are going to fight for lower taxes, we are going to fight for small and family businesses, we are going to fight for mums and dads and we are going to fight for those Australians who haven't got the time to go around and get on Twitter and wear T-shirts and turn up at protests. We are going to fight for the Australians who are out there putting their kids through school, running their businesses, getting their kids educated, ensuring that they are supporting their communities, and running their local sporting organisations. That's who we are fighting for.

          The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The member for Batman will resume her seat. The member for Robertson.
