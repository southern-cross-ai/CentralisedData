        Today I would like to talk about some outstanding capital projects in Bonner. I have been proud to support these projects through the Stronger Communities Program. The fantastic thing about Stronger Communities is how it makes our local communities a priority. Wayne Cameron from

        , a local environmental group that has received funding for a vital revegetation project, put it well to me. He said the project has many social as well as environmental benefits. Their newly funded project will help get more locals involved in the group and help build a shared love of the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stronger Communities has also helped support other activity groups that are a cornerstone of Bonner. Karen Dixon, President of Wyndham District Horse and

        , said they are now able to go ahead with lighting and electrical upgrades that will boost safety for the over 1,000 people who use their facilities each year. Jim and Sue Horton from the Mount Gravatt Lapidary Club tell me they are now finally able to upgrade equipment that is between 20 and 40 years old. This will help the club be more energy- and cost-efficient, saving them money in the long run and helping them bring in more members.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the members of my Stronger Communities committee. They recently met to decide which submitted projects in round 2 would go on to the next stage of the selection process. I am grateful for their time and assistance. I very much look forward to delivering more upgrades to our community.
