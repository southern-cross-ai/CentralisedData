         I thank the member for Banks for his question on this very important issue, which is the progress in relation to

         Airport and the work that the government is doing towards Western Sydney Airport being ready to open in the mid-2020s. We have now finalised the environmental impact statement in relation to the Western Sydney Airport, and that has been provided to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Energy, in mid-September. The final environmental impact statement draws on some 700 field investigations and 19 technical studies. It is very comprehensive in the matters it addresses—such matters as noise impact modelling, assessment of air and water quality, health risk assessments and all of the matters that should be considered in an environmental impact statement for a project of this scale.

           Of course, it follows the draft environmental impact statement which was issued last year. There are some very important changes which the government has made in response to community consultation on the draft environmental impact statement. We have made a commitment that there will be no single merge point over the town of Blaxland. We have made a commitment that there will be no single merge point over any residential community. We have expressed the position that our preferred option is for head-to-head operations to the south-west of the airport—the more lightly populated area—between 11 pm and 6 am where safe to do so. What that will mean is that during this time flights will both take off and land to the south-west, where it is safe to do so. It is very important that we do the detailed work to determine exactly when it will be safe to have head-to-head operations directed towards the south-west, but the early indications are that in over 80 per cent of the time head-to-head operations to the south-west will be safe.

           Airport, when it opens, will be closer than

           and will be a more convenient option for some 2 million people. The 2012 joint study on aviation capacity in the Sydney region pointed out that by 2027 there will be no more slots available at Kingston Smith Airport, and by around 2035 there will be practically no scope for further growth of revenue passenger services at Kingsford Smith Airport. So Western Sydney Airport is very important to meet the capacity needs of Sydney and Australia, and of course it will deliver a major economic boost to Western Sydney—some 11,000 jobs during the construction phase, and by the early 2030s some 9,000 jobs directly at the airport as well as the economic activity that will be attracted.

             that I recognise the Prime Minister. I want to be really clear on this, because I did chastise the Leader of the Opposition on this very subject. This is the last time I want make this point. I am happy to circulate the page from the
             <i>
              House of Representatives Practice
             </i>
             . The Prime Minister can end question time at any time. It states that very clearly. It can even be during an answer or during a question. I am saying that to the member for Jagajaga, because if there is a repeat of this I will have to take action. To the member for Isaacs: while I admire his athletic endeavours at the end of question time each day, there is no point to them.
