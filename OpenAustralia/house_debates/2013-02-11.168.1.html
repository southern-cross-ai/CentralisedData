        I rise today because I wish to note with appreciation the running of the 2013 Camden Classic Carnival on 3 February at Camden Oval in my electorate of Hindmarsh. I have spoken about the Camden Classic previously and I do so again today because it is an event that is held every year in my electorate, an event of considerable stature within the

        n and even national athletics calendars. Camden Athletics Club runs a series of races which we outsiders collectively refer to as the Camden Classic, including races for under-14s, under-17s, under-20s and over-35s. Distances range from 50 metres to the 1,600-metre race, and the actual Camden Classic is a 400-metre race for men. There is a women's Camden Classic also of 400 metres. These are the absolute highlights of the carnival.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the winner of the men's Camden Classic was Matt Hargreaves of Victoria, who ran the distance in 48.41 seconds. That is an absolutely terrific time for the 400 metres at any level of competition. The women's Camden Classic was won by Yasmin Openshaw with a time of 54.64 secondsâ€”again a great time at any level of competition. So congratulations to both Yasmin and Matt for their victorious wins in those two wonderful races.

        Camden Athletics Club has had a very proud history since its formation in 1931 and it is currently being well served by president,

        , and many others as well as the volunteers who give their time to ensure that they give to the community one of the greatest athletic races in our state of South Australia. One member of the Camden Athletics Club committee who is a terrific champion for athletics in our region and who volunteers for this wonderful event every year is Colin Rowston, who has spent countless hours organising and running the Camden Classic year after year over many years including this year. The gift of the Camden Classic that is given to the community by all members of the Camden Athletics Club and participants, considering the time and the energy given to this community event, is truly appreciated and all involved deserve our wholehearted appreciation. It is a wonderful event. On the Friday prior to the event there was a fundraiser barbecue which I attended, together with Mayor John Trainer and other members of council.
