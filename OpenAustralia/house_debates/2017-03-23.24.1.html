        It was my great pleasure to attend the opening of the new LifeCare centre at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwood_East" rel="nofollow">
         Burwood East
        </a>
        on Sunday afternoon. The new centre is described as Crossway's 'heart response' to those struggling in the local community. LifeCare is a community services organisation passionate about helping people in tough places flourish. It provides help for people in our local community who are experiencing hardship, such as relationship issues, depression and anxiety, domestic violence, addictions and other challenging life situations. Put simply, LifeCare is rebuilding lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        One person whose life is being rebuilt is Sam. He shared his heart and truly inspirational story to well-being and success with the integral support of LifeCare. LifeCare's services include counselling, mentorship, financial coaching, community meals, as well as an incredible women's centreâ€”a safe haven run by women for women. It was truly wonderful to join the Crossway community to open their new centre and celebrate their amazing work in Chisholm and the broader community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The centre is a haven ably run by the fantastic employees and numerous volunteers. The new centre will make it possible to help even more people. Congratulations to Pastor Dale Stephenson, board chair
