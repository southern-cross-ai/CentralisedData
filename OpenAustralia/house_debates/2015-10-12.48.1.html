        I wish to congratulate the mighty Maroubra Saints

        girls under-18 team, who won their first premiership in September this year. Guided by co-captains Erin Keogh and Greta Stonier and coached by Bronwyn Gulden, the girls won a thumping 38 to 1 victory over Drummoyne, taking out the club's first-ever female premiership. The Maroubra Saints AFL club is a remarkable against-the-odds success story. Established in 2000 in the heart of

        territory, the club has grown from 15 players and one team in its first year to now 26 teams with 420 players across the age groups of five to 17. Not only has the membership of the club grown exponentially but also the trophy case is now brimming, with the under-18 girls making it six premierships across multiple age groups. This year the under-12s team also won the premiership, and five of the teams made the finals.

        . But it is not all about winning. This is a great community club, and they emphasise enjoyment and the growth of the kids. I am honoured to have such a successful, positive AFL club in my community. I also congratulate the senior team, the Randwick City Saints, on a very successful season. It was a privilege to attend your presentation evening. May there be many more successes for the Maroubra Saints.
