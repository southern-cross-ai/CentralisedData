         Honourable members will be aware of the devastation that was caused last year by the outbreak of equine influenza and will be pleased to see the racing industry getting back on its feet and doing well again as we now move into the

         season. A couple of weeks ago I referred to a test that had come out as a positive for some horses that were in quarantine. I indicated at the time that it was likely to be a false positive. It is important to advise the House that this did turn out to be a fact. Each of the 74 horses in the quarantine station was tested using 14 different procedures before they were all given a clean bill of health.
        </p>
        <p>
         We still have some horses at the moment in the quarantine facilities. In fact, nine internationals are at Sandown at the moment preparing to compete in the racing carnival. One of them is the Irish champion horse, Septimus, trained by Aidan Oâ€™Brien. The Spring Racing Carnival is not just held in the capital cities. The member for Page, who asked me the question, not long ago was kind enough to invite me to the Ballina Cup Race Day, which last year was not able to be run on the usual day. Regional members will understand just how important those race days are, both for enthusiasm for the local economy and for the local community. Ballina Cup Race Day is also a half-day holiday for workers in Ballina and provides a major economic boost for the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we now move into the period for the Spring Racing Carnival, the preparations behind the scenes continue, even though some of the races have already begun. In particular, we move with great enthusiasm towards the race that stops the nation, the

         . This is a particularly important day for me as someone who was born on
