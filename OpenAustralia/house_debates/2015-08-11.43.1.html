        Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election as Speaker by this chamber. Also, I am sure that there are many ex-students of Kerrimuir Primary School, which we both attended, who will be proud of what you have done.
       </p>
       <p>
        My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Will the minister update the House on the government's strong, credible, effective and fair approach to reducing carbon emissions? What would be the impact of alternative proposals?

         Mr Speaker, on a point of order: there has for long time been a ruling in this place that questions asking for alternative policies were not part of a minister's responsibility. There is specific reference to it in

          Mr Speaker, on the point of order: the question asks about alternative proposals, which cover not just the policies of political parties but all alternative proposals other than the government's suggested policies.

           <p>
            The point I was making was that the question asks about alternative proposals, which of course means that the minister can range across all suggestions about emissions reduction schemes and the costs to the economy, not just the sensitivities of the opposition on this matter. Of course, there have been many years of precedence of these questions being allowed even if they asked about alternative policies.

             <p>
              Mr Speaker, I add my deep and personal congratulations; you deserve this honour. The member for Swan comes to this place as a tradie with real-world experience. In fact, he was an electrician, so he understands the value of electricity and its impact on individual lives when electricity costs skyrocket. Against that background, I thank him for this question, because he represents both a concern for the cost of living and a concern for the environment, and that is what we bring in the policy which we have framed today.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have announced an emissions target for Australia of minus 26 to 28 per cent from 2005 to 2030. That puts us ahead of Japan, at minus 25 per cent; ahead of Korea, at minus four per cent; ahead of China, at plus 150 per cent; and comparable with the United States, at minus 26 to 28 per cent, and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
               New Zealand
              </a>
              and Canada.
             </p>
             <p>
              But how are we getting there? We have an Emissions Reduction Fund which produced four times the reductions—and I want those opposite to understand this—in just the first auction, at a fraction of the cost (approximately one per cent of the cost per tonne of abatement), than Labor produced during the entire carbon tax experiment. So we have a system which will allow us to achieve our goal, which will do the right thing by the world, but which will not drive up electricity prices.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am asked whether there are any alternative proposals, and there are. The Labor Party, in the last few weeks, has told us about an alternative proposal—

He told us it was a tax. What does it mean? Only yesterday we saw the true costs of their own modelling of their own policy. Their own tax showed a $209 price, a $600 billion cost and a $5,000 per family hit—their modelling and their tax showed a 78 per cent increase in wholesale electricity prices. We will make real reductions but we will do it without an electricity tax. They have failed to make real reductions and they will impose a crushing electricity tax.

                    There is modelling and it will shortly be released. I can give the member who asked the question a bit of a foretaste of that modelling. Let's be honest and up-front with the parliament and with the people of Australia: if there is going to be significant emissions reduction there will be a cost. There is no entirely cost-free way of significantly reducing our emissions. The modelling that was done by the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
                     Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
                    </a>
                    shows that a 26 per cent reduction in our emissions on 2005 levels by 2020 will cost the economy in the year 2030 between 0.2 and 0.3 per cent of
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
                     GDP
                    </a>
                    , so the overall cost to the economy of this will be in the order of $3 to $4 billion. The modelling also shows that a cut in the order of 40 per cent will cost more like two per cent of GDP—a massive hit on our economy, a massive hit on jobs and a massive hit on families which this government will never impose.

                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">

                         Authority has recommended? If every country adopted targets like these, we would be on the road to four degrees of global warming. Haven't you just chosen to appease the deniers instead of satisfying the science? Isn't this just a weak and dangerous target from a weak and dangerous government?

                          At least the member who asked the question is honest and upfront about the Labor-Greens target. At the Labor Party conference the other week they committed to an emissions reduction target entirely in line with the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
                           Climate Change
                          </a>
                          Authority's recommendation, which was 40 to 60 per cent—that would be a two per cent reduction in the size of our economy if the Labor-Green policy were adopted. Not only would there be a two per cent reduction in the size of our economy if the Labor-Green policy were adopted but there is a carbon tax of more than $200 a tonne—part of the electricity tax scam which the Leader of the Opposition wants to foist on the Australian people—and there is a massive $85 billion overbuild of renewable energy capacity thanks to the 50 per cent renewable target that the Leader of the Opposition has also committed himself to.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          To get back to the precise question that the member for Melbourne has asked, our commitment of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction is entirely in line with the United States commitment, a little less than the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

                          </a>
                          commitment, somewhat more than the Japanese commitment, much more than the Korean commitment and immeasurably better than the Chinese commitment and, when it comes to emissions reduction per person, the very best in the developed world. This is a strong and responsible position that the government has adopted. It is environmentally responsible and it is economically responsible. Unlike members opposite, we are not going to clobber the economy to protect the environment. We appreciate that the best way to protect the environment is to have a strong economy too. The best way to protect the environment is to have more Australians in jobs in an economy which is growing strongly—and that is exactly what people will get under this government.

                           <p>
                            I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. The government is committed to being a positive, constructive player in the international response to climate change. The 2030 emissions reduction target that we announced today is responsible, it is achievable, and it is a contribution which is in step with the efforts of other developed countries. Climate change is a global challenge that requires a global response. We are already working with other countries to deliver practical action on climate change, including through our $200 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund and our $28 million contribution to the Global Green Growth Institute. The government is committed to achievable action on climate change, and we have an impressive track record already. Unlike most other nations, Australia not only met our first Kyoto target under the Kyoto protocol—we exceeded it. We are now on track to meet and beat our 2020 target as well.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            In the context of the forecasts of our population growth and our economic growth, our 2030 target is credible, appropriate, fair and environmentally and economically sound and responsible for our national circumstances. It is a significant increase from our 2020 target, and Australia will reduce per capita emissions at a far greater rate than most other countries, including those in the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
                             EU
                            </a>
                            and including the United States, Japan, China and Korea. We will halve our emissions per person over the next 15 years, and without a carbon tax. We have been inventive, we have been creative but we have always been responsible in meeting our climate change commitments while protecting the living standards of Australians and ensuring that our economy can continue to grow and jobs will continue to grow.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I have been asked what is a responsible contribution in international terms. This is a responsible contribution. What is not responsible is Labor's endorsement of a carbon reduction target of up to 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2030. It is not responsible to reintroduce a carbon tax—a supercharged carbon tax—to do it, and Labor's own modelling shows it will hit wages, reduce household incomes and drive up electricity prices. That is the Labor way.

                                 Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was asked about a responsible contribution to the international effort. We will take a responsible target to the Paris meeting on climate change at the end of the year. It is environmentally sound, it is economically sound, it will not hit wages or reduce household incomes, it will not reintroduce a carbon tax, as the Labor Party has proposed, and it is environmentally and economically credible, sound and responsible.
