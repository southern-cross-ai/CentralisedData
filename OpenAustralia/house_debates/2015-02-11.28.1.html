        of Myra church stood as a beacon of faith and hope for many who have made the Penrith region their home. For more than 175 years, the church has stood by our community through the good times and the bad. From the vantage point on the hill, St Nicholas has played a pivotal role in shaping much of our city and as a result has become a pivotal part of our region.

         St Nicholas of Myra
        </a>
        church was laid on 9 December 1839. Unlike other places of worship that have closed down or moved, St Nicholas of Myra has survived through the ages. For more than 17Â½ decades, St Nic's has played the central character to the personal stories of so many local families as they celebrate and commemorate some of the most special moments in their lives. St Nicholas has truly forged a unique and special place in the heart of our city.

        This was one of the first churches in the region, and I recognise the inspiring and integral contributions made by many. Like their patron saint, whom the church is named after, long have the parishioners, priests and volunteers been generous with the many gifts that they have bestowed on our region. I congratulate the congregation on the wonderful events they have run to commemorate this wonderful church.
