        <p>
         Our ability to keep Australians safe is the envy of the world. The quarantine system, which came about as a result of national cabinet, using hotels for quarantining, has worked largely successfully. It has. We have indeed placed health as the No. 1 priority as we work through COVID-19. We've also made sure we had the economic outcomes. We've put the money into the budget, in successive budgets, to build into a better place out of COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
         So we've made sure that we're strengthening the economy, but we're doing it at the same time that we're placing at the heart of everything we do the welfare and the health of Australians. Indeed, the federal government stands ready to take any detailed submissions from state governments to build quarantine facilities, but there will be criteria around such facilities. They will have to be close to an international airport where there are international routes. They will need to be close to a tertiary hospital such that there are extremely good medical facilities and medical experts there to help with any outbreaks. We are making sure that, if it comes to quarantining, we've got an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOU" rel="nofollow">
          MOU
         </a>
         with the Victorian government on quarantining. But, when you look at the statistics worldwide, you see the latest figures in the United States—615,000 deaths—and that is tragic. They have a very good health system in the United States. In the

         127,000 people have lost their lives.

                Apropos of my previous answer, we are happy to work with any state, any territory to build a proper quarantining facility so long as we've got those criteria answered as well as local community support. But we're not going to subject regional areas to any potential outbreaks, because regional areas have been the safest place in all of the world during this COVID-19 pandemic, and I wouldn't want to live anywhere else other than regional Australia right now, because it has proven to be leading the economic recovery out of COVID-19 and the safest health-wise in all of the world.
