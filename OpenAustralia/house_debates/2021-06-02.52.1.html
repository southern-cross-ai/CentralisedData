        to mark the 50th anniversary of the 3rd Battalion,

        . For Judith and Harley Stanton from Youngtown in northern Tasmania, these events will be particularly moving, as part of the service will be dedicated to their brother and brother-in-law Ronald William Betts. Pilot Officer Betts, a member of the ninth squadron, was the first

        pilot to be killed in Vietnam, on 20 March 1971, when the squadron was called in to support the 3rd Battalion, RAR. He was just 24 years old.

       <p>
        Born in Launceston in 1947, Ronald was the son of Mannie Betts, a radio operator with the RAAF during World War

        . According to his family, all Ron ever wanted to do was learn to fly. On 20 March 1971, the helicopter he was co-piloting received 47 gunshots. Betts was medevaced to

        . He remembers Ron as a very popular and well-liked bloke and said that, in Vietnam, his piano playing after a few beers was enjoyed by many. His death really shook the ninth squadron. Peter eventually carried the Australian flag bearing Ron's name when the Vietnam veterans were finally give a welcome home march. To Judith and Harley, I hope this event is a fitting tribute to a young man who sacrificed his life in service to our country.
