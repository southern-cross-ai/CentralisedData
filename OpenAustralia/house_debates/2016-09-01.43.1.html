       <p>
        I wish to congratulate Leigh McCleery, Gordon Merchant and Jon Donohoe on being inducted into the Australian Surfing Walk of Fame at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroubra_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Maroubra Beach
        </a>
        at a ceremony on 24 July as part of the Beach Breaks junior surf carnival.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gordon Merchant was a Maroubra grommet who grew up surfing at Maroubra and with his partner, Rena, began making board shorts on their kitchen table in 1973. They called their company Billabong and it went on to be one of the world's most successful surf labels. Gordon was made a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in 2010 and continues to be a supporter of many medical, youth and marine conservation organisationsâ€”a worthy recipient of this honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jon Donohoe won 10 Australian surf lifesaving titles and swam for Australia at the 1956 Olympics. He has been involved in surf lifesaving for 62 years, as an athlete, administrator and commentator. He was also made a Member of the Order of Australia and is Chairman of the Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service.
       </p>
       <p>
        My good friend Leigh McCleery, better known as Leigh Habler, won numerous Australian surf lifesaving titles, represented Australia at the 1992 Olympics in swimming and was five times an Australian surf lifesaving team member and the first female captain of an Australian surf lifesaving team.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are all worthy recipients. The culture of being around the ocean is strong in

        and these worthy recipients deserve these accolades. Thanks to Randwick City Council for continuing to support this initiative.
