       <p>
        When arriving at the decision to find a better way to deliver meaningful cost-of-living relief, through the tax cuts passed here this morning, the Albanese Labor government listened to the voices of young people. The voices of youth are vital to ensuring their aspirations are realised.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm currently hosting a young intern, Luis Parkinson, at my electorate office and I listen to him. Luis has reminded me of the great examples of success of youth advisory groups in representing young people at the local government level in Hasluck. In Mundaring, this representation guides the Youth Engagement Partnership Fund, which supports community groups with grants of up to $25,000 to implement youth driven initiatives aligned with the shire's youth services model. In Kalamunda, the stunning Stirk Park redevelopment, which I was pleased to open last year, was informed in its design by the voices of young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister Aly, our Minister for Youth, is an extraordinary person who sees the power of engaging and listening, and so created the youth advisory committees that create a now permanent structure for voices to be heard. When young people in Hasluck and around Australia spoke up about their cost-of-living challenges, we listened and we responded with the cost-of-living tax cuts. A young person working in retail in a supermarket in Midland on a taxable income of, say, $45,000 will now receive a tax cut of around $804. A young childcare worker in Ellenbrook just starting out on an income of $55,000 will now receive a tax cut of $1,054.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Luis and to the youth of Hasluck, we listen to the views, we hear you, you're valued and we've got your back.
