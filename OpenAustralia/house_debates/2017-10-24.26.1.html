       <p>
        Last Friday the Queensland Rural Regional and Remote Women's Network gala dinner was held at Emerald. Today I'd like to congratulate Senior Constable Sarah Grayson from Charleville's Queensland police station, who was awarded the Woman of the Year Award. This is an award that recognises the significant contribution to a high-priority issue in Queensland. To be successful, the nominee must demonstrate resilience and strong leadership, and must constantly strive to improve and inspire others to achieve their goals.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the deserving high achiever, it's no surprise that Senior Constable Grayson was also awarded the Professional Woman of the Year Award, which recognises a woman who, through the course of her work, has influenced change to improve services to regional, rural and remote women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senior Constable Grayson has almost 24 years of policing experience working in some of the most challenging and remote communities. Senior Constable Grayson has worked tirelessly to identify barriers in rural communities and works towards making positive changes. It gives me great comfort that we have people like Senior Constable Grayson working to make our regional, rural and remote communities a better place to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I would also like to congratulate all the nominees for their service and dedication to regional, rural and remote Queensland. It is inspirational and greatly appreciated.
