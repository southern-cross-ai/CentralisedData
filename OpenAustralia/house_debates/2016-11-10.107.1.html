       <p>
        I too came to speak about elections—municipal elections in this case. The beauty of democracies like Australia and United States is that periodically people get to decide who their government is. I found over the years that when you lose an election, the first thing you should do is examine why you lost the election rather than blame those who have won the election—but I will leave it at that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I came to congratulate the new councillors in my municipal areas, having had recent elections in Victoria. In Manningham I congratulate Geoff Gough, for a return to the council after many years, and Michelle Kleinert in Heide Ward; Dot Hayes, who has been returned in Koonung Ward; and Paul McLeish and Councillor Sophie Galbally in Mullum Mullum Ward. They will be joined for this next period in the Manningham council by Paula Piccinini, Anna Chen, Mike Zafiropoulos and Andrew Conlon. In addition to congratulating all of those councillors who have been elected, I congratulate Councillor Michelle Kleinert for being elected the new mayor of Manningham for the forthcoming term. It would be remiss of me not acknowledge the work over the past terms of those councillors who were not re-elected: Councillor Jim Grivokostopoulos, Councillor Meg Downie and Councillor Stephen O'Brien.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroondah_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Maroondah City Council
        </a>
        , I congratulate Councillor Tony Dib, in the Arrabri Ward, who was returned. Also returned were Councillor Nora Lamont, in the Mullum Ward; Councillor Samantha Marks, also in the Mullum Ward; and Councillor Rob Steane, in the Wyreena Ward. They are now joined by Councillor Kylie Spears and Councillor Paul Macdonald, in the Arrabri Ward. In the Mullum Ward is someone known particularly to those on the other side. They will be interested to know that Councillor Mike Symon, who was a member here for Deakin previously, is now a councillor in the Maroondah council. He is joined by Councillor Michael Macdonald and Councillor Marijke Graham, who make up the new Maroondah council. I congratulate Councillor Tony Dib, who has been elected as the mayor, and Councillor Nora Lamont, the deputy mayor, in the Maroondah council.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally on councils—although the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banyule_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Banyule City Council
        </a>
        is not in my electorate, it adjoins it—I take the opportunity of congratulating Councillor Tom Melican, who has been elected the new mayor of Banyule. Tom has been a friend of mine for a long time. Indeed, we had children in the same babysitting club together a few years ago. I congratulate him, and I congratulate all of those councillors and wish them well in their duties in the forthcoming term.
