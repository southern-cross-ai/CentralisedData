       <p>
        I'd like to acknowledge a member of my community who, at 91 years old, continues to prove that nothing beats good, old-fashioned grit, dedication and life experience. Campdrafting legend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stanton" rel="nofollow">
         John Stanton
        </a>
        has been taking out titles for over 70 years, having won his first campdraft competition in 1946. In 1954 he was selected to ride as a buckjumper on the previously completely unridden feature horse at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Easter_Show" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Easter Show
        </a>
        for Queen Elizabeth
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , where he was offered 25 pounds by the show committee if he managed to stay on the horse. He conceded that he was 'probably selected because they didn't think they'd have to pay the money'. Well, they had to pay it in full. He was awarded the Warwick Gold Cup in 2017 for his lifelong contribution to the sport. At the time he was quoted as saying, 'While I can pull my boots on, I want to keep going. And, when the day comes that I can't get out of bed and pull my own boots on, I'll be prepared to hand my number plates in.' Recently at the local Macksville Show, just a couple of weeks ago, at 91, he took out the cut-out title, beating other competitors less than half his age. It looks like those old boots have got plenty of kick in them still, John. Many thanks to the organisers of the Macksville Show and all the competitors. Also, John, I'll see you next year. You're a legend.
