        So many Australians are looking forward to Christmas this year like never before. As we come together as families and friends, we will be celebrating the importance of those bonds that are the most special in our lives. They have never been more important than during this crazy and difficult year. There will be hope across the country that as we put this year behind us we will be able to look forward to a much better 2021. With the evidence of the economic recovery underway and such promising signs for COVID vaccines there is cause for optimism. As MPs, we have all seen the magnitude of the impact of the pandemic in our own communities. It has been a year of uncertainty and, in some cases, great hardship, of separation and anxiety. But through all of this our communities have come together; from the individual acts of kindness to the work of so many organisations, this has been inspiring.

        I want to thank my own community in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        . So many have rallied to assist others in need, from individuals, to community groups to our religious organisations and, of course, there is the incredible work of professionals, like those in health and those in teaching in our schools. They have all been so magnificent. As we leave this horrible year behind, I know that through the actions of our citizens, communities and governments we can be so proud to call ourselves Australians, because if there is one thing this pandemic must surely have confirmed it is there is no better nation than our own. To all the residents in my own electorate I say, 'Merry Christmas and may the new year be a much happier one than 2020.'
