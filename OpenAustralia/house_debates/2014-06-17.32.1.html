       <p>
        Yesterday in question time the Prime Minister said that 'This is the budget that the Australian people elected us to bring down'. What kind of alternative planet is this government living on? This clearly shows that members of this government and the Prime Minister are not out there talking to the people in their electorates. When I am out talking to people in the Bendigo electorate, they are saying that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        co-payment is unfair. Rural doctors are saying it will stop people from going to the doctor. What they are also saying in Bendigo is that they are outraged by the health cuts—$25 million cut from Bendigo Health. The government was not clear about that in opposition—they did not stand up in front of Bendigo and say, 'We will cut this money from your hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government also did not tell people that they were planning to increase the petrol tax, which will hit regional people really hard. If only every cent of that petrol tax went back into Bendigo roads. If every single cent of that petrol tax went back into Bendigo roads, we would not have a roads problem in regional Victoria. The people in the Bendigo electorate do not support the cuts to education. Gonski would have delivered fair education for all. The people in Bendigo also do not support the changes to universities. This budget is unfair, it is cruel and it is another example of how this government is not talking to the community. They are out of touch.
