       <p>
        Over the weekend, we saw an extraordinary development in Labor's reckless quest to pass its radical workplace relations agenda. On Saturday night, Labor leaders engaged in a late-night talkfest with Independent Senator David Pocock to strike a deal on the passage of the bill. According to media reports, up for negotiation was a change to the size of businesses that could be roped into multi-employer bargaining, with the threshold lifted from 15 to 20 employees. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees can also, supposedly, now avoid industry-wide bargaining if there is a belief that they are not comparable with other companies, with the onus on the union movement to prove a common interest.
       </p>

        Unsurprisingly these concessions have not eased the fears of the family owned and aspirational businesses in my electorate. They, along with many business groups, agree with the coalition's assessment that Labor's legislation will complicate the system, create conflict in workplaces and cause delays. On top of this, the Independent senator's deal does not remove the issue of costs revealed in the regulatory impact statement. An owner of a small or medium-sized business in my region is still on the hook for between $14,000 and $80,000 in costs if forced to participate in multi-employer bargaining. Given how tough times are, I don't know many who could afford such a hefty hit, especially with power prices, inflation and interest rates all going up.

        Labor has tried to reduce this debate to be simply about wages, neglecting to mention that jobs could be lost if businesses are forced to scale back or close. Key Australian values of autonomy and freedom of association will be undermined as businesses lose their ability to negotiate in the shift of power towards the unions.
