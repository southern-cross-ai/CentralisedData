        I would like to speak about Operation Flinders, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n based charity. Earlier this month my wife Kate and I visited an exercise of Operation Flinders at Yankaninna Station. Previously, in 2004, I visited another exercise, which was held on Warraweena Station. I was also a member of the Operation Flinders property acquisition group, which had the objective of finding a permanent home for this worthy charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Operation Flinders runs a world-leading wilderness adventure program for young offenders and young people at risk. It was set up back in 1991 by Pamela Murray-White, a teacher and former army officer. As a teacher Pam worked with students who had behavioural problems. Pam realised that some outdoor elements of army life would have a positive effect on these students. People often talk about boot camps, but I emphasise that Operation Flinders is conceptually different from a boot camp. It is not about hardening up these youths at risk. It is more about encouraging them to make positive changes in their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pam worked with local ADF personnel to set up the program, where the Army provided personnel, stores and logistics support. In 1991 she conducted one exercise with 35 participants and by 1993 this number had tripled. Today they run a number of courses each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pamela passed away from cancer in 1995 but left a legacy to the youth of South Australia that still runs strong today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank Executive Director John Shepherd AM, Graham 'Spingo' Spinkston and Tony Moggridge for giving us an excellent overview of the work they do at Operation Flinders. Operation Flinders has been conducted at four sites: Moolooloo Station, Warraweena Station and Angepena Station and, only in the last year, they have now found a permanent home at Yankaninna Station. Operation Flinders takes people between the ages of 14 and 18 on an eight-day exercise in the far north of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Ranges
        </a>
        . It is held on Yankaninna Station, which is 65 kilometres east of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Leigh Creek
        </a>
        , which lies west and north of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gammon_Ranges_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Gammon Ranges National Park
        </a>
        and Arkaroola.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teams trek 100 kilometres through the Flinders Ranges, covering somewhere between eight and 15 kilometres a day. The terrain is saltbush, native pine and mallee. The aim is to develop personal attitudes of self-esteem, leadership, motivation, teamwork and responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        In their packs they are provided with everything they will need. The packs include only the basics: their sleeping bag, eating utensils, ground sheet, hootchie, wet weather gear, tent pegs, ropes and water. Each team member is allocated team duties each day, including team captain, cooking, digging latrines, building the fire, minding their teddy bear mascot and other normal campsite duties. During the eight days the team members are also taught basic bushcraft and navigation skills. They undertake a number of trust and team-building exercises, designed to build confidence and overcome their fears. In addition they are exposed to the local Adnyamathanha community, the traditional owners of that land. They partake in local Aboriginal culture, learn from the Adnyamathanha dreaming and prepare and consume traditional food.
       </p>
       <p>
        An independent evaluation of the program back in 2001 reported that at the time the program was leading the world in its outcomes. It also found that the young people at high risk underwent a significant positive change as a result of their attendance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the teams have completed their eight-day trek they are individually presented with a memento of their time and a set of dog tags that have a 24-hour-a-day telephone number they can ring for further support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Operation Flinders is a worthwhile cause. I encourage everyone to check out their website, www.operationflinders.org.au, and get involved. In October they run a trailblazer challenge, which is their major fundraiser. Groups can walk or run distances between 18 kilometres and 100 kilometres. This is something that a lot of businesses get involved in.

        , which will be screening in early October, walked with the group. I look forward to seeing that on the ABC. I encourage other states to look at Operation Flinders and what has been achieved there for youth at risk.
