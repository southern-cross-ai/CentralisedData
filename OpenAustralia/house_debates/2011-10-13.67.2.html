        Last night revellers were causing havoc in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenferrie_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Glenferrie Road
        </a>
        shopping strip in my electorate. Acts of violence and widespread littering are all too common. The local traders' association, local police and Boroondara Council, led by Councillor Phil Meggs, are united in their belief that something must be done. I was therefore delighted to hear the Assistant Treasurer and member for Maribyrnong say, when asked by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Neil Mitchell
        </a>
        last Friday about the mess in Glenferrie Road, 'Put in some closed circuit cameras on the Maccas because that will stop people.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, Assistant Treasurer, here is your chanceâ€”show us the money! Unlike the Labor Party, the coalition had a policy at the last election to put
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        cameras in major shopping strips across the country. In Kooyong I committed $70,000 for cameras in Burke Road. Now has come the time to put them in Glenferrie Road. It is estimated by local council that the installation of CCTV cameras will cost around $280,000 so today I have written to the Assistant Treasurer seeking a commitment for this amount. If the government are not prepared to pay for the CCTV cameras they should not be suggesting it.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this was not the Assistant Treasurer's only faux pas in his interview with Neil Mitchell. He also claimed that the increased littering was due to the removal by council of rubbish bins: 'The other thing though is, have you ever noticed, I reckon councils are getting rid of bins.' This is simply not the case. The Boroondara Council has confirmed that there are 21 litter bins and 21 recycling bins along the shopping strip on Glenferrie Road and that this number has remained steady over time. So, Assistant Treasurer, you are wrong again.
