        Recently in my electorate, I had the privilege of attending the grand opening of the new industrial design building at the Faith Lutheran College in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockyer_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Lockyer Valley
        </a>
        in the township of Laidley.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government contributed a grant of $465,000 under the Capital Grants program. The state government also contributed matching funding, and the Faith Lutheran College contributed $1,228,340 towards the project, making the project in excess of $2.1 million. It will accommodate woodwork, metalwork, graphics, the sciences and state-of-art facilities.

        For years I have watched this school grow. The constants in that community have been a number of motivated people, and I pay particular attention to, and dedicate this speech to, the principal of the school—none other than Janelle Anderson, who has been at the school since the first student was enrolled. They now have over 620 students, who come from a vast geographical area. I think they have about 12 large school buses, where they provide a service to the community. Janelle Anderson is a tower of strength for that community. There is still more to be done there, and I wish her the very best—with Janelle's enthusiasm, and the cooperation of her board, her executive staff and all the teaching staff—as I do for the success of all their students.

         Last week I stood in this chamber and let the House know that 21 small businesses in my electorate of Bendigo publicly declared their support for marriage equality. They took out a full-page ad in the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Advertiser" rel="nofollow">
           Bendigo Advertiser
          </a>
         </i>
         on Saturday saying, 'It's time, Australia. We support marriage equality.'
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, I am proud to stand here and say that on Saturday a double-page ad featured in the
         <i>
          Bendigo Advertiser
         </i>
         , with 83 small businesses in Bendigo publicly declaring their support for marriage equality, an ever-increasing number of regional businesses saying, 'I support marriage equality.' These businesses include the Foundry Hotel Complex, Wine Bag,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Cinema" rel="nofollow">
          Star Cinema
         </a>
         , Honeyeater, World of Tiles Bendigo, Hardcopy Entertainment and Sutherland Property Bendigo—to name just a few.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am incredibly proud that the small businesses in my electorate are standing up and saying, 'It is time for marriage equality.' They are speaking loudly, calling on their senators in their region to join them. It is a chance for Senator Bridget McKenzie and Senator Michael Ronaldson to hear their calls and to support marriage equality. This is a regional town stepping up to say it is time, and it is about time we saw the government get on board and allow a free vote of their members so that people in regional Australia and all people in Australia can see their dream come true—the dream of marriage equality. It is time.
