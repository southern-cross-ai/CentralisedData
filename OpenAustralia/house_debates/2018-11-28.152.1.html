        The federal government has made a significant investment in upgrading Australia's border security through the acquisition of the P-8A Poseidon aircraft and the

        -3C Orions, which are due for withdrawal in 2018-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of my role on the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I have been involved in the capital works program to upgrade the aircraft maintenance facilities in preparation to accommodate the new wing. Based at Royal Australian Air Force Base Edinburgh, the program is an important part of Australia's future maritime patrol and response strategy. The coalition government has committed to acquiring 15 Poseidon aircraft, of which 12 aircraft have been approved for acquisition and three are the subject of normal government defence acquisition approval processes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first aircraft arrived in Canberra in 2016, and the remaining 11 will be delivered by March 2020. The P-8A Poseidon has advanced sensors and mission systems, including a state-of-the-art multi-role radar, high definition cameras, and an acoustic system with four times the processing capacity of the outgoing AP-3C Orions. This new advanced capability will enhance the ability of the

        </a>
        to detect and combat the smuggling of illegal cargo, illicit drugs, narcotics, prohibited items such as weapons, and the smuggling of contraband and unauthorised persons across Australia's vast maritime borders. The incursion of unauthorised vessels into Australia's sovereign territory can be detected, providing early warning of security risks, and alerting authorities to threats to our national security and biosecurity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Poseidon is built specifically as a military aircraft. It is based on the proven commercial design of the Boeing 737-800 fuselage but has been substantially modified to include increased strengthening for low-level operations down to 200 feet and high-angle turns, as well as the capacity for armaments. The federal government takes our national security very seriously and has made a significant investment in upgrading Australia's border security through the acquisition of a new wing of 15 P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft.
