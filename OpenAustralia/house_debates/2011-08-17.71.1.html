       <p>
        Today I would like to draw attention to the valuable contribution made by men's sheds in the Canberra community. Over the past decade men's sheds have increased dramatically across the country to promote men's issues. Men's sheds focus on helping men around Australia with any problem they might be facing. It could be a health problem, isolation, loneliness or depression. The shed connects men with their community and establishes a feeling of mateship.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Canberra there are two men's sheds and another one is currently being proposed. Men in the community such as Robyn Matthews in Greenway and Kevin Bawden in Richardson work overtime to run the men's shed. I would personally like to thank them for their time and commitment to improving men's health and wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        A men's shed provides a space for mateship and a feeling of belonging. It meets the needs of members and their families. It has a developed program designed to advance men's health and wellbeing. It is inclusive to men of all ages and has a strong community engagement. I would like to acknowledge men's sheds throughout Australia and all those individuals who operate the sheds for their commitment to their community and to the health and wellbeing of their members and for their commitment to promoting and assisting men with their range of issues.
