        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Fit-out of new leased premises for the

       <p>
        The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry proposes to lease the whole of the proposed new building in Canberra city known as 18 Marcus Clarke Street, with overflow office space into the adjacent new building, known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NICTA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The developer commenced work on building construction in January this year. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fit-out will commence in March 2007. Both works are due for completion by September 2007.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that this work proceed, noting that the estimated cost of $36 million may be less, due to lease incentive arrangements. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry accepts and will implement the recommendations of the committee. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake a fit-out, at an estimated cost of $76.879 million inclusive of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , of new leased premises at Civic in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        . The new premises will replace a number of existing leased premises of varying quality fit-out within the Canberra CBD and is planned around the expiry of existing leases. Construction work on the new buildings, known as section 84, commenced in November last year, and the Australian Taxation Office proposes to undertake a fit-out of these new leased premises.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed fit-out and associated installation of services will, to the maximum extent possible, be integrated with the base building construction in order to reduce costs. The buildings are planned for completion in May and November 2007. The Australian Taxation Office anticipates occupying the buildings progressively throughout 2007 and 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed, noting that any money saved due to lease incentives will be returned to consolidated revenue. The final negotiated agreement with the developer involves a lease incentive to the Australian Taxation Office, which will be offset against part of the cost of the fit-out. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.
