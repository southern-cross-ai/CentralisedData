        My question is to the Prime Minister. Families are feeling the impact of Labor's homegrown inflation, with the cost of almost everything going up. Food is up 10 per cent, housing is up 12 per cent, insurance is up 26 per cent, and electricity and gas are up 18 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. Why are Australians paying the price for the weak economic leadership of this Prime Minister?

          I'm asked about where we are under this government two years in, which we will commemorate next week. What we inherited with energy was that energy wholesale electricity prices in the June quarter of 2022 were $264.

                 The question, in anyone's interpretation, was very broad, because the question was actually about the price of economic leadership over the last two years, and there was a whole range of issues in the question. So I think, on anyone's definition, this was a pretty broad question, and the Prime Minister now has been specific with his answer regarding the issues raised. So I think everyone can agree it's very relevant.

                  They're embarrassed by their budget of 10 years ago, when we saw the coalition unplugged. We know that the inflation figure that we inherited was 2.1 per cent in just a quarter, and today annual inflation's at 3.6 per cent. On wages, of course, the biggest drop, outside of the pandemic, in real wages this century occurred in the March quarter of 2022—again, down 1.4 per cent. Our government has seen real wages rising for three consecutive quarters. There was a sluggish labour market under them. Under us, employment growth has doubled—780,000 new jobs created. Productivity under them was the worst in 40 years. Under us, it is up in the last three quarters. Business investment declined, under them, to the lowest levels since the early 2000s. Business investment has grown in every quarter under Labor—up 13 per cent in real terms.

                  But, of course, budget policy will be there for all to see tonight—something that would be familiar to them. They produced mugs saying that there was a surplus, but that's all it was. They treated Australians like mugs. They never produced a surplus in almost a decade in office. Tonight we will see the second surplus in a row, with a $9.3 billion projected surplus, following on from last year's $22 billion, which is better than the $78 billion deficit that we inherited from them.
