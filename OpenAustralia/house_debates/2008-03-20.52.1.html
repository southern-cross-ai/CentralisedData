        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his previous statement regarding Mr Ian Tang of Beijing AustChina Technology that ‘I am not really across what he does’. Now that the Prime Minister is aware of Mr Tang’s sponsorship of 16 Labor Party trips, including his own world trip, can the Prime Minister now advise the House of his understanding of what Mr Tang does?

         The company concerned obviously has dealt in the past with technology trade, as would be suggested by its title. I notice also, on the question of what the company does, what the shadow minister for foreign affairs himself said today. When asked, ‘What about this company?’ Mr Robb said:
        </p>
        <p class="moved">
         That’s not the point. We, we, we don’t know about this company. We know nothing really about this company.

           And I have answered that part of the question. On the question of this particular company, it seems that the previous government knew a lot indeed about this company. I have here a letter from the Australian Embassy in Beijing to the mayor of Beijing which is along these lines—this is from 2007, I understand:

            Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We know the Prime Minister’s office has asked Mr Tang for all correspondence with the previous government; that is fine. But what we are doing is asking this Prime Minister what he believes this company does.

              (Austrade) office of the Australian Embassy, Beijing, would appreciate any assistance that the office of the Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People’s Government is able to provide so that the project can move forward in line with project timelines.
             </p>
             <p>
              It goes on:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The Australian government has maintained an ongoing interest in this high-profile project in the centre of Beijing. As you may be aware, the Australian Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Mark Vaile MP, visited the project during his December 2006 visit to Beijing. The project—
             </p>
             <p>
              and this goes to the question—
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              involves the provision of products, services and facilities supplied by both Australian and Chinese companies to what will be a landmark project of cooperation between Australian and Chinese businesses.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is a letter from the Australian Embassy in Beijing seeking the cooperation of the municipality of Beijing in support of this particular company and invoking the Deputy Prime Minister as a keen supporter of the project, he himself having visited the project at that time. Of course, the honourable member said in his statement this morning that his government knew nothing of this particular company. I would suggest that letter suggests that his government in fact knew quite a lot about this company and what it was doing. The question was: what did the company do? I have referred to what the company did.

                         He is in office at the time in a party which have received $155,000 in donations from the company which they are objecting about. But the member for Goldstein says the government—referring to himself—knows nothing about this company. This letter says that in fact the government was actively intervening on behalf of this company in relation to a specific project in Beijing, the company having directly donated to the party to which the then Deputy Prime Minister belongs. But let us just leave the National Party alone for a bit. Let us move on to the Liberal Party. Remember that the member for Goldstein said, ‘We know nothing about this company.’ The National Party say they know nothing about this company, so what about the good old Liberals?

                            Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order and it goes to relevance. The Prime Minister, reading out letters from the past, which he has dug out over the last 24 hours, is not answering the question of what he knew about this company.

                             Without wishing to enter into the debate around this question, I would think that if the Prime Minister is reading from documents—wherever they have come from—as the basis for his knowledge of the company that is an acceptable response to the question.

                              government’s paeans of praise for this company go on. We have one from 27 March 2006 to Mr Ian Tang himself, again from the Australian Embassy in Beijing, advising Mr Tang what a wonderful job that company was doing. I table that one as well. From all of these documents we see a clear pattern. Whether it be the National Party, which is the recipient of $155,000 worth of political donations and whose Deputy Prime Minister in government was in Beijing actively supporting the project of Mr Ian Tang, or whether it be the Liberal Party, through the communications minister, Senator Alston—given the technology focus of another part of this company’s operations. All along they have been actively supporting this company’s operation and, through Australia’s agencies in China—namely, the Australian Embassy and Austrade—they put on the documentary record not just the nature of this company’s activities but how much this government actively supported it. Therefore, I think we have a case of someone’s credibility—namely, the member for Goldstein—collapsing in a heap.

                              Let me go through what the member for Goldstein has said this week. On Tuesday of this week he said that my particular crime against humanity was that I had travelled to the Sudan in the company of a representative of this company. That was untrue. He went on to say that, while I was in Sudan, I was there representing the commercial interests of this company in the technology field. That was untrue; I was visiting western Darfur. Then today he had the audacity to go on the national media and say, ‘We don’t know about this company.’

                              for Goldstein, the government of which you were a part knew a flaming lot about this company. The National Party-Liberal Party got 155 grand on the kick. I would suggest that we have here a modest case of double standards. If there is a fundamental problem of supported commercial travel, let the member for Goldstein come to the dispatch box now and announce on behalf of the opposition that they do not wish to receive any supported travel of a commercial nature in the future.
