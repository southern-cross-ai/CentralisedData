        I'd like to support the member for Calwell's address to the House in the last 10 minutes or so. It is shocking news for Palestine and Israel. Israeli bombs have killed Palestinians in Gaza. In excess of 60 people, including children, have died. Hundreds of Palestinians have been injured in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         West Bank
        </a>
        by Israeli forces, and Israelis themselves are in fear of rocket attacks from Gaza. While we can all call for calm, we also need to call for the end of injustice that is at the core of the problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        The core of the problem is that Palestinians do not live in freedom and dignity. To live under apartheid-type rule is inexcusable. This week Palestinians commemorate Nakbaâ€”in 1948 the Jewish military depopulated and destroyed Palestinian cities, towns and farming communities, and it's still happening today. An estimated 750,000 Palestinians became refugees after fleeing from their homes, many of whom are still refugees today. I'd like to remind the House that Palestinian troops fought alongside Anzacs and British troops in

        to repel the Turkish and German troops. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Beersheba" rel="nofollow">

        in 1917 and the charge of the light brigade in Southern Palestine will always be remembered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Zeina Kilani, an academic legal researcher, mother and Queenslander, is the daughter of a Nakba survivor. Zeina's father was born in Akka to a family that farmed land near Nazareth in Palestine. His family grew olives and raised livestock for many generations. In early 1948 the military attacked towns and villages. Zeina's grandparents fled on foot with their children and what they could carry by hand. They became stateless refugees in Lebanon for the remainder of their lives, yearning to return to their land and livelihood, but they were never given that opportunity. It's time for the Palestinians to have dignity, human rights, civil rights and recognition. The right to live in peace and harmony with Israel is essential, and we all must work together to make this happen.
