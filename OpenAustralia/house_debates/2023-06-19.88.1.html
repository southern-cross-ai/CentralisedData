        My question is to the Prime Minister. What is the Albanese Labor government doing to address the need for more affordable and social housing? What is getting in the way?

         I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. As she knows, the Labor government that I lead believes that every Australian deserves the security, stability and dignity of a roof over their head. It's important. I know it because I've lived it.

         On Saturday, I was proud to announce our new $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator—funding to be delivered to states and territories within two weeks; funding that we're able to do because we had a responsible budget going forward, that has created this space. It builds on what we've been doing so far: a National Housing Accord; increased funding for social and affordable rental housing; $2 billion to finance social and affordable rental homes through the NHFIC; the largest rent assistance increase in 30 years; and, of course, our Housing Australia Future Fund, which failed to pass today because of an unholy alliance between the coalition and the Greens—the new 'no-alition'!
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, we expect the Liberals to oppose public housing because they've never, ever supported it. But what we had over there with the Greens teaming up with them is working to block public housing. Let me say this: this isn't student politics. What happens here affects the country and, instead of hyperventilating like a debating team, you need to bring people together to get things done. Those in that corner deal in protests; we deal in progress. They see issues to campaign on; we see challenges to act on. They want to build their profile; we want to build more homes. Building a brand doesn't put a roof over anyone's head. Families can't take shelter under a petition. When you want work done, call for the Labor Party, because we don't stop working on things because the Greens have cold feet. We're not waiting around for them, promising the world and delivering nothing. This is what it means to lead, to govern. We keep working till we find a solution, bringing people together on a plan that works. That's what we've done, and that's what we'll continue to do, because we know that this issue is too important to wait.
