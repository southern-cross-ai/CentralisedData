        I move:

       <p class="moved">
        That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended to enable the following to occur during the periods set aside in standing order 34 for government business on Wednesday 18 October 2006:
        <dl>
         <dt>
          (1)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          in relation to proceedings on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Television" rel="nofollow">
           Digital Television
          </a>
          ) Bill 2006, at the conclusion of the second reading debate, not including a Minister speaking in reply, or at 11.00am, whichever is the earlier, a Minister to be called to sum up the second reading debate and thereafter, without delay, the immediate question before the House to be put, and when resolved the Bill then (if required) being considered in detail for up to 30 minutes and then any question or questions necessary to complete the remaining stages of the Bill to be put without amendment or debate; and
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (2)

         <dd>
          immediately after proceedings on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2006 have concluded, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (

           Media Ownership

        </dl>
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not wish to detain the House very long in speaking to this motion. I simply say that the government did suggest to the opposition that all speakers on the speaking list could be heard before question time. The opposition, for all sorts of reasons, did not want to ensure that the debate was finished by question time. For that reason, I have moved this motion. I now move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the question be now put.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question put.
