        I seek the House's indulgence to speak about the tragic events of 20 January in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourke_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Bourke Street
        </a>
        mall in Melbourne. On behalf of our parliament and the Australian people, I send our heartfelt condolences to the families and friends who lost loved ones. I send our prayers for a speedy recovery to those who were injured, and our thoughts and sympathy go to all those who witnessed this horrifying criminal act.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an ordinary day shattered by terrible violence. Six innocent people lost their lives. Another 37 sustained serious injuries. To the Victorian police, paramedics, firefighters and ambulance workers who responded so quickly, selflessly and professionally, but who will carry their own scars of that day too, we are humbled by your service. We offer you all our deepest gratitude.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I visited the memorial of flowers in the days following the attack, I met with the men and women of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Police
        </a>
        , who work night and day to keep the people of Victoria safe, as do our police and security services, the finest in the world, all around the nation. That Friday afternoon, they took on threats and horrors many of us would find almost unimaginable. They and all of our emergency services deserve our solidarity at all times. They will always have our absolute, unequivocal, total support. To the doctors, nurses and ambulance workers who gave each trauma victim first-class care and treated their families with kindness and compassion, we say thank you.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that all of the first responders would expect us to also thank and honour the bystanders in Bourke Street that afternoon for their extraordinary acts of humanity. There was the young man who tried to stop the car before it drove into the crowd. There were staff from local businesses who used their own first aid kits and defibrillators to begin immediate treatment of the injured. There were shopkeepers who offered the public refuge from the fast-moving vehicle. There were those who shaded the injured from the sun and those who were injured but felt their injuries were not as bad as others, so encouraged the ambulance workers to look at the more severely injured first. There was the cabbie, the office workers, the shop assistants and the law student, who set aside their own fear to offer assistance, a reassuring word or the immeasurable comfort of a human touch. These actions illustrated the strength of the human spirit, and which the paramedics, the police and the fireys praised for making their work so much more ably completed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our sorrow is tempered by the way Victorians and the Australian people more broadly responded to this senseless act, and that was with love. The community is rallying, contributing to the Bourke Street Fund and offering support through acts of great generosity or words of sympathy, leaving floral and written tributes. That show of solidarity says so much about the people of Melbourne, the people of Victoria and all Australians. I take this moment, as I did in the wake of that shocking crime, to say again to the Premier, the lord mayor and all Victorians: all Australians stand with you as one community as your community heals from this dreadful day.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are important lessons to learn from this. The Victorian government is examining and reviewing the state's bail laws and processes, as it should. Last year, following the terrorist truck attack in Nice, I tasked the counterterrorism coordinator to review the challenge of protecting places of mass gathering. While the review found that we had largely robust protections in place, it was also clear that more work was required. I have therefore commissioned a national strategy for protecting places of mass gathering, and agencies are working closely on this with the states. This is a very real issue. We saw in Nice what a truck was able to do, and we saw in Melbourne what a simple motor car, a widely available vehicle, was able to do. This protection of places of mass gathering is very a important issue. We cannot ever eliminate all threats. We know that, but it is our first duty as governments, at all levels, to keep Australians safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today our thoughts and prayers, first and foremost, are reserved for the six families, who are learning to live with the loss of their loved ones. There are no words that will ease their pain. But we hope that they will feel the love, support and absolute resolute solidarity of the Australian people. We hope they draw from this the strength they will need as they travel this most difficult of journeys, reconciling themselves with this shocking loss.

         I thank the Prime Minister for his words just then.
        </p>
        <p>
         Friday, 20 January was in so many respects a typical Melbourne day. It began with an unexpected rain shower that quickly gave way to sunshine. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Open
         </a>
         was on. My home town was packed with tourists, shoppers, workers. And then that day was shattered.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have lived in Melbourne nearly all of my 49 years. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourke_Street" rel="nofollow">
          Bourke Street
         </a>
         Mall is a place that every Melburnian, every Victorian and probably every Australian knows. We have caught the 86 and the 96 tram along the mall. Many of us can picture the mall with our eyes closed. I visited the Myer Christmas windows as a child, and I have taken my own children to see them. I think perhaps that is why this tragedy has affected us so strongly, because, unlike some of the tragedies and disasters which confront the human condition, this one was not somewhere else; it was one which could have affected any of us, as we have all been there.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the Sunday, like the Prime Minister, the Premier, the Mayor—like thousands of Victorians—I visited the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPO" rel="nofollow">
          GPO
         </a>
         and laid some flowers out the front. It was later in the afternoon when I was in a supermarket in Essendon in my electorate when a strong, burly bloke came up to me, and he summed up the feelings written on so many faces and written on so many cards. He simply said about Bourke Street: 'What is the world coming to?'
        </p>
        <p>
         What is the world coming to when this can happen? This was not an act of political or religious terrorism. It was a crime of senseless violence. The victims were chosen by cruel circumstance—they just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time: Matthew Si, a son, a husband to Melinda and a father; Jess Mudie, a daughter and twin sister to Emily; Bhavita Patel, a daughter and a sister; a 25-year-old visitor from Japan whose family have asked for privacy in their grief; and two children: Thalia Hakin, aged 10, a week away from starting grade 5, and Zachary Bryant, who was just three months old.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been said before: in the English language, a wife who loses her husband is a widow; a husband who loses his wife is a widower; children who lose their parents are orphans; but there is no word for a parent who loses a child. The unfillable hole of pain—that whole body shock of: 'Why my family?'—is too much for a single word. Those of us who do not know cannot imagine; those who do can never explain. Yet in their tributes the families have not spoken of how they died but of how they lived: the brilliant student; the much-admired colleague; the caring father; the 'badass' sister; the beautiful baby. And these families, with all their losses and pain, have thanked their fellow Australians for their kindness and compassion. Such grace in grief is truly remarkable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like the Prime Minister, many people who were on the scene that day have spoken movingly of the kindness amidst the chaos. At the vigil at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_Square" rel="nofollow">
          Federation Square
         </a>
         that I attended, a young man named Henry Dow told the story of Lou, a taxi driver, who, in shirt and tie, took calm command of all around him. In a world where we have seen too much iPhone footage of violence on the street, too many helicopter angles of attacks on the innocent, it would have been entirely understandable of Melburnians to flee the scene in that moment of fear. But the footage only shows our people, our fellow Australians, running towards the danger, administering
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPR" rel="nofollow">
          CPR
         </a>
         , comforting the wounded—even as there were still shots ringing out. They did what I think we hope we all would when confronted by the same set of circumstances; but perhaps we wonder in our hearts if we would be as brave as these fellow Australians. They saw strangers in trouble and did not see them and did not think of them as strangers. Ordinary people who were extraordinary. This goes for the police, too; the emergency services personnel; the trauma hospital teams desperately trying to keep people alive.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most important job of every government is the safety of our people. I know that bail laws are different in every state. But what Australians in every state cannot understand is that, when offenders have done horrific things, when the red light should be flashing, they are out—they are on bail.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bourke Street has gone deep into the consciousness of Australians. It stirs the same emotions as the murder of Teresa Bradford in Queensland, and all the others—in particular, women—killed by violent partners at large in the community. At every level of government, we need to get better at identifying the warning signs and using every measure to keep people safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today the parliament salutes the courage of our citizens. We honour the care that our people show for one another, even in the hardest times—especially in the hardest of times. We embrace those in mourning and those in pain. And we pay our respects to those stolen from us. May they rest in eternal peace.
