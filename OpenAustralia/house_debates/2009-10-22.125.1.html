        I rise today to speak about particular program running in my electorateâ€”one which makes a difference to young disadvantaged people between the ages of 16 and 20 who live in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Fields" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Fields
        </a>
        . The program is called Reconstructing Lives and is funded under the new Innovation Fund, which we know is designed to address the needs of the most disadvantaged job seekers in our community, and that is exactly what this program is doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am talking about young people in my electorate who have a history of unemployment. This project takes on particular significance given that the youth in my electorate, particularly in the suburb of Macquarie Fields, are not faring all that well. Youth unemployment is running at 25 per cent and there is generational unemployment as well as gangs, drugs, alcohol and anger management issues. It is for these reasons that this location and this project are ideal to address the disengaged youth in Werriwa.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rudd government in June this year provided $154,000 to

        </a>
        Network at Ingleburn for this life-changing Reconstructing Lives project that aims to break the cycle of poverty and unemployment through a residential program aimed at the development of the participants. The project includes residential training, work experience and then placement into ongoing employment opportunities in the building and construction industry.
       </p>

        About four weeks ago at Eucalyptus Reserve in Macquarie Fields, I farewelled 15 enthusiastic young men and women who were setting off for their four-week residential job training program which will ultimately give them a Certificate I in Construction, with white-card accreditation. The participants were: Andrew Speechley, Beau Collier, Sina Mativa, Margaret Pera, Darcey Phillips, Salia Hafoka, Sarah Tana, Jason Hopson, Normie-Luke Manns, Mark Pace, Faauuga Taimalie, Joseph Turaganivolo, Sione Fonokalafi,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Ali" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Rongo Pera. They are all now involved in a range of both physical and mental development activities planned specifically with their needs in mind. It includes early mornings, cleaning and cooking, loads of exercise and, very clearly, new rules. It should be known that most of these young people have never been away from home, their family and their friends, so this was a pretty big deal for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken with Dianne Hamer, Regional Manager,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Region" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Region
        </a>
        , MAX Employment, who is overseeing this project and she advised me that there have been a few issues along the way; nevertheless, she was happy to report that all but two participants are today in their final week of the residential program. She went on to say that all the participants are focused and working hard to achieve their personal goals. This project is already changing lives. These young people are becoming more confident every day and, more importantly, are determined to return to their local community to make a positive difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the completion of the residential program next week, the participants will begin their four-week work experience with Spotless and its subcontractors. These organisations have the contract to maintain

        accommodation in Macquarie Fields, and the participants will be given the opportunity to work on a number of these dwellings that are under construction or renovation, with the design of securing ongoing employment for the participants in their local area. Following this, mentoring and post-placement support will be provided for six months. This will include mentoring by the Wests Tigers

        Club, for the benefit of all the participants.

       <p>
        Last night a graduation ceremony for the participants to pay tribute to their achievements thus far was held at Wests Leagues Club. In fact,

        , one of our Rugby League greats, was the guest speaker, and he spoke about having goals, being proud of who you are and staying on course, even if your friends are straying. I am advised that the event was a huge success and that the difference in the participants was obvious. Their improved communication skills and confidence levels, their smiles and the spring in their steps were all noticeable. I would like to read an excerpt from one of the many speeches that were made. It is from Andrew Speechley, who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Six months ago I was trying to get my life back on track, cause I was doing drugs and drinking alcohol and I thought to myself I need to change. Mandy from Max Employment saw me in the street as I was walking past the office and asked if I wanted to do a course. I said yes and next thing I know I was packing my bags and I was off. We arrived at Mowbray Park Farm Stay all quite nervous, not knowing what was on the road ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is indicative of the experience these young people had, and we now have13 ambassadors for the youth in our area.
