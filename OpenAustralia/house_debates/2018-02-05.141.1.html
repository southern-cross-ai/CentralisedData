        Late last year I was fortunate enough to visit the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Forest High School
        </a>
        as they celebrated the end of the school year, the achievements of their students and their positive impact on the community. I would like to give particular mention to Emma Beukers, who started a Cupcakes 4 a Cure campaign, selling cupcakes to raise money for The Kids' Cancer Project. The school as a whole was quick to embrace the initiative, raising nearly $1,000 in only one day. Congratulations to Emma and the Forest High School community for getting behind such a brilliant grassroots initiative with such enthusiasm. Thank you also to principal Ms Rosemary McDowall for allowing me to be part of such a special occasion, and congratulations on such a great year.

        To round off 2017, I joined the Sydney Japanese International School in

        </a>
        to highlight the impressive achievements of their students and their school community throughout the year. The school very clearly continued in their commitment to enrich the lives not only of their students but of the wider community through education. Hosting a readathon on their annual charity day, the school supported the invaluable work of the Room to Read foundation, advocating for the importance of literacy amongst youth in Australia and raising money to aid the development of vital literacy skills in developing countries. I would like to congratulate the principal, Jodie Hoenig, and the school as a whole for their generous commitment to ensuring our future remains a bright and compassionate one.

        In December I was honoured to join the Oxford Falls Grammar School's senior award ceremony as they recognised the astounding academic and extracurricular achievements of their students in 2017, under the guidance of principal Dr Peter Downey. A shout-out to the year 12 students who achieved impressive

        On 12 December last year, I attended Elanora Heights Public School's presentation day to recognise the hard work and the academic, sporting and leadership achievements of their students and the school community as a whole. Throughout the year, principal Mrs Leesa Martin has set an exceptional example for her students, and the school community has rallied behind countless local charities. Through their generous Christmas gift appeal, the school supported

        </a>
        presentation day, I was proud to join the school community to celebrate a brilliant 2017. Students excelled in all areas: in academics, in sport, and in demonstrating active leadership. Talented local dancers from the school enjoyed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, performing in the Sydney Super Dome for the Schools Spectacular. The school community showed their solidarity for victims of domestic violence by raising nearly $800 for the White Ribbon Foundation. I would like to thank principal Mr Andy Rankin for inviting me to such a special event and congratulate the school on a fantastic year.

        Thank you to principal Jane Ferris for inviting me along to Pittwater High School's annual presentation night at the end of last year—and what a year it was! Pittwater High School achieved brilliant results in the HSC, with 31 students making it onto the distinguished achievers list—a commendable result for the school, the teachers and above all the students, who should all be very proud of their hard work and dedication to their studies. Special congratulations to Kain Thompson, who placed in the top 20 in the state for
