        Today I would like to congratulate the staff, students and parents at Campbelltown
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_School" rel="nofollow">
         Public School
        </a>
        on its 140th anniversary. Campbelltown Public School is a fantastic school in my electorate, made up of 300 very clever and intelligent students and their dedicated teachers and parents. It was the very first school to be built in Campbelltown and it is still a very important part of the community today. Students and staff at the school are seen each year taking part in community events like the Festival of

        street parade, Anzac Day commemorations and Macarthur's 24-hour fight against cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school opened on 11 January 1876 with 90 students. The community had to raise 1,000 pounds to contribute to the 4,000 pounds of building costs as well as help build the school. When the school first opened up, there was no water, no electricity and no sewer. The first school principal would walk to Hurley Park reservoir and bring two buckets of water back each morningâ€”one for drinking and one for handwashing. The principal lived on site in a building located where the current school library is today. The school received electricity in 1923 and water around the same time. School uniforms were introduced in 1962, but, before then, students all wore their Sunday best. Boys and girls were taught separately. The boys learnt geometry and Latin, and the girls were taught sewing and home economics. Things have changed today. In total, the school has had 23 principals. The longest-serving staff member, Margaret Chrystal, has been with the school for 28 years. Margaret, along with

        , Hazel Cockcroft, Debbie Gilroy and Julie-Ann Cowan have been tirelessly collating Campbelltown Public School's rich history. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to their work.

        That is just a brief look into the rich history of this wonderful school in my electorate. There have been many students from Campbelltown Public School who have gone on to achieve great things, including

        chronicles. Students at the school are still doing amazing things today. Just last year, year 6 student Sarah Al-Nakeeb was the recipient of a Fred Hollows Humanity Award. Sarah received her award from the Premier at a special awards ceremony at

        in Sydney. She was nominated by her teachers for being a humble and quiet leader, who always assisted others without complaint or the need for recognition. I am sure that, like those before her, Sarah will go on to achieve great things and make her school, community and family very proud.

        Another former student of the school making a difference in his community is Ronald Flockhart. Ronald was one of the bellringers of the school in 1957. He is now an engineer. Whilst at the school's 140th celebration, Ronald noticed that the school bell was in a poor state and offered to restore it as a gift to the school. It was a lovely gesture from a former student and shows the unique relationship the school has with its students and community members.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through its long and rich history in my electorate, Campbelltown Public School has many things to be proud of. But, most of all, it can be proud of producing thousands of fine young men and women who have grown into fantastic people living in the Macarthur region today.
