       <p>
        In Gilmore we have a unique federally funded training opportunity for our young people. It's been happening for many years, and I'm hoping it continues for many years to come. This Shoalhaven Youth Volunteering Initiative, called SYVI, provides year 10 students from public and private schools with the opportunity to undertake accredited training with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Fire_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Rural Fire Service
        </a>
        whilst contributing to their local community through participation with a volunteer emergency agency. I'm constantly told by employers and community members about the skills they expect from our young people when they leave school. Schools provide students with reading, writing and maths—hopefully—whereas the SYVI project covers many more areas of value, particularly communication and teamwork. This project allows students to attend accredited training at a local

        facility and over five full days learn to work as a team, learn to use their initiative, be mentored by experienced RFS personnel and volunteers, and experience the value of their volunteering in their local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the successful completion of their training, students are presented with two certificates—their accredited bushfire certificate from the RFS and a certificate from the

        —recognising their participation in a volunteer project. These two documents become part of the student's

        and are very prized by local employers. The training is provided at no cost to these students, many of whom go on to become full-time volunteers with their local RFS brigades, and some go further in working in local emergencies. For many years the project has consistently met its

        s and been delivered with the RDA on time and within budget. It's unfortunate that many students have to be turned away from this successful initiative, as it's always oversubscribed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many local schools, such as Nowra High and Ulladulla High, encourage their students to participate in this program, which I'm truly proud of. Students from these two schools will soon be getting their certificates. Congratulations to the RFS teams and also the students from Nowra: Annalise Young, Zane Wilson, Sean Tunks, Gemma Thompson,
