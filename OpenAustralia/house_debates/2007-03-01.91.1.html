       </p>
       <p>
        It is very clear that the government has determined once again in an election year to go down the low road in what it sees as an opportunistic way to promote its electoral prospects. This is because it has run out of ideas. It has run out of ideas in this parliament and outside of this parliament. This week we have seen Labor take up a number of positive initiatives, taking on a tired government that can no longer hide 10 years of complacency, years and years of inaction on its watch.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday we took on the issue of interest rates and the economy. The government is no longer in touch. The fact is that more household income than ever before is being consumed by mortgage repayments. The Prime Minister refused to answer the questions of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue even when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        figures were tabled indicating that 9.1 per cent of household finances went on housing interest payments in September 2006 compared with 6.1 per cent in September 1989. The Prime Minister refused to address the question and the true interest rate reality being faced by families today.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Tuesday the opposition had to ask seven questions during question time before the government admitted to having had discussions with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Walker" rel="nofollow">
         Ron Walker
        </a>
        and Australian Nuclear Energy Pty Ltd before commissioning the Switkowski report. This is a government that is happy to say that it supports nuclear energy but wants to pretend you can have nuclear energy without the 25 nuclear reactors actually being located anywhere in Australia. On Wednesday, time and time again, we heard how the government, after years and years of talk, has failed to act and deliver on a national curriculum for Australia’s schoolchildren. It has failed to act and deliver on supporting maths and science. It has failed to act and deliver on investing in education and training so that we can secure Australia’s prosperity. The fact is that it has even managed to ignore its own recommendations on the provision of early childhood education.
       </p>
       <p>
        No matter how much this government is prepared to get down into the gutter and try to smear the Leader of the Opposition and others, that will not hide the fact that it has no ideas and it is ill-equipped to govern in the new century. This is also a government that has no respect for proper parliamentary processes and for democracy. It is a tired government that cannot hide 10 years of complacency. This is a government that is out of ideas. It is out of action and out of time. Australia is looking forward to a government that will actually prepare Australia for the future, rather than a government that has ridden off the back of the mining boom and squandered the opportunities created by the boom to maintain productivity growth.
