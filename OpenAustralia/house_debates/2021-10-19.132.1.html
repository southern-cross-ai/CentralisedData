        I'd like to acknowledge the Woolgoolga United Football Club, who this year are celebrating their 50th birthday. The first senior men's team was formed in 1971, and in 1975 they won their first premiership. They had only one team for the first six years, and then in 1977 formed a reserve grade side. From 1979, games were played at the high school. The first women's team was formed in 1999, and Kim Batty has played in the women's team since it was formed, making this year her 29th year playing first grade footy for the Woolgoolga football club. Now, in 2021, the club has over 400 players registered across 27 teams and is one of the largest clubs in the Coffs district.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club also established the Harmeet Shetra Memorial Shield in memory of club member Harmeet Shetra. This special event, organised by Gurminder Singh, is held once a year at the Clive Joass Memorial Sports Park.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the current committee, which includes President Peter Knott; Vice President Kim Batty; Secretary Bec Smart; Treasurer and Registrar Jada Johnson; social media, Patrick Mullan; publicity, Holly Stapleton; Summer 6's president
