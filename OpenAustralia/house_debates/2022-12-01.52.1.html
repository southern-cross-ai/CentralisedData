       <p>
        Today I'd like to wish a belated but very happy 90th birthday to Peter Rae AO. Peter was born on 24 September 1932 in Launceston. He represented our state and the Liberal Party as a senator from 1967 to 1986. His Senate career was characterised by an independent spirit of inquiry. Peter then went on to serve in the Tasmanian parliament in the lower house for three years before returning to work as a respected lawyer, co-founding the law practice Rae &amp; Partners over 35 years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a Liberal with a commitment to our 'we believe' statement of caring for the environment, Peter is often referred to as the father of renewable energy in Tasmania. He is a former chairman of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydro_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         Hydro Tasmania
        </a>
        and of the Tasmanian Renewable Energy Industry Development Board. He has played a leading role in turning Tasmania into the renewable energy powerhouse that it is today. He was a trailblazer. His commitment to sustainable environmental practices is to be commended, and it's one that many Liberals can look to.
       </p>

        Peter's commitment to public service and to the Aboriginal community of

        in 1999. In 2005 Peter was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award from the

        . Peter has always been a great mentor to me and a great source of advice. He is the style of Liberal that
