        My question is to the Minister for Ageing. How is the government continuing to support older people affected by the Victorian bushfires?

         I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. I note her deep concern in relation to this matter. Could I start by expressing my condolences to all the people affected by this terrible tragedy—a tragedy that has shocked and saddened our nation. As part of the emergency procedures during the Victorian bushfires, eight nursing homes and hostels, with more than 300 residents, were evacuated. I take this opportunity to commend the staff and volunteers who assisted with these evacuations. In response to the devastating bushfires in Victoria, the Australian government has undertaken many practical measures to help older people affected by the bushfires.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today I have advised the Victorian Minister for Community Services,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Neville" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , that the federal government is providing up to $500,000 for extra home and community care services for older people in the bushfire affected areas. This means they can get help in their homes and with services such as Meals on Wheels, personal care or community transport. In total, we are providing up to $1.5 million to cover the costs of emergency nursing home care and of replacing necessary items burnt in the bushfires—such as motorised wheelchairs and walking frames—and personal care items lost by older Australians in the bushfires.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, we have also removed the requirement for aged-care assessments for older people affected by the fires. This is a one-off measure that has fast-tracked aged care for older Victorians needing emergency respite care. This means cutting through the red tape to get nursing home places for them immediately. So far, 18 older Australians from the bushfire areas have been provided with respite care in nursing homes. They can stay in the nursing homes until they are able to make longer term arrangements for their accommodation, or they may decide to remain in the nursing home on a permanent basis. This is about providing practical help to those older Australians who have suffered and lost so much in these tragic bushfires.
