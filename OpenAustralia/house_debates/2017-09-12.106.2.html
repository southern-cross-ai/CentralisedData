        I'd like to mention today some of the wonderful projects being undertaken by locals in my electorate of Richmond. It was with great pride that I officially opened the Tyalgum youth precinct on Saturday, 2 September. I was very pleased to have delivered $20,000 in federal funding from the second round of the Richmond Stronger Communities Program towards this outstanding local project. Our local Stronger Communities Program has delivered funding right across the electorate for small capital grants, supporting projects that contribute to the vibrancy and viability of our wonderful region. For this project,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , in partnership with the community, identified the need for better facilities in Tyalgum for young people. These improvements have created an important social hub for younger people and indeed other Tyalgum residents. At the official opening, so many locals and visitors attended this wonderful celebration. The skateboarding workshops and demonstrations were the main attractions of the upgraded Tyalgum Memorial Park, alongside circus performance activities, a free barbecue and stalls. Many parents commented to me that the park was such a great asset, because it catered for children of all age groups. In total the $200,000 upgrade was a joint project of Tweed Council and the Tyalgum Community Consultative Group. At the opening I acknowledged their vision and commitment to the design of these wonderful facilities. The Tyalgum community are to be commended for their dedication to their village, with all the work they do alongside the Tweed Shire Council, for this wonderful project. It shows how much we can achieve when we work together.

        I'd also like to emphasise the success of the Stronger Communities Program in regional areas such as my electorate of Richmond. The new third round of funding has seen many applications received by the Richmond community consultation committee. I thank everyone on the committee, which is made up of dedicated members of organisations such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballina_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Byron Shire Council
        </a>
        , Tweed Shire Council and local Rotary and VIEW clubs, for their wonderful work and look forward to working with them and the successful applicants. Their task was made very difficult by the very high quality of applications received, yet again. Exciting projects, such as upgrades to tennis, cricket, croquet, outrigger and rowing clubs will provide a much-needed boost to local sporting organisations in the area. Other examples of wonderful projects are upgrades to children's centres, community showgrounds, local arts halls, veterans memorials, and charity organisations, all of which play a pivotal role in providing essential services in our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's important to recognise the vital role of community organisations in building social goodwill and adding vibrancy to our regions. A wonderful amount of work is being done at a local level by these volunteers, who work tirelessly, particularly to raise that 50 per cent cash or in-kind contribution required for the Stronger Communities Program. In closing, I would like to urge the government to support the continuation of programs like the Stronger Communities Program so that not-for-profit organisations are able to access much-needed financial assistance.
