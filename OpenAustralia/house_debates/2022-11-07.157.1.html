        Today I would like to wish the happiest of birthdays to a local northern Tasmanian organisation which has been at the centre of supporting our region's migrant population for 40 years. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_Resource_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Migrant Resource Centre
        </a>
        began in 1982 with the aim of providing access to services to help newcomers settle into Launceston and surrounding areas, and to create awareness in the broader community about the challenges that new arrivals face. While the organisation has grown and thrived, particularly in recent years under the leadership of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Ella Dixon and a passionate board, this mission has not changed.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC" rel="nofollow">
         MRC
        </a>
        has grown from a micro not-for-profit with just one paid employee to an organisation employing over 40 people, including many migrants who once received assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        To be celebrating a milestone birthday is also to reflect on the road taken. As Ella said recently, MRC's first few years were lean and every victory was hard-fought, but challenges were overcome and partnerships were forged that made new opportunities possible. The founding members and the chairs and committee members that came after them have never given up. This determination is what has allowed the organisation to thrive year after year decade after decade and has led to 40 years of successful migrant support services in Tasmania.

        providers to launch in Tasmania, MRC has continued to identify, develop and implement key programs and services that continue to build a stronger and more inclusive multicultural Northern Tasmanian community. In fact, it was the tremendous work undertaken by MRC to successfully resettle the first Bhutanese families to arrive under Australia's humanitarian program that led to Launceston being chosen to have a pilot program for settling Afghan Hazara refugees in regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past 3Â½ years I've had the enormous privilege of building relationships with the Chin, Afghan Hazara, Nepali and many other migrant communities in the area. While there are of course challenges that exist with resettlement, there are many wonderful stories of jobs secured, new skills gained, businesses started, sporting teams created and houses purchased by migrants who now call our region home.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be remiss of me not to mention the challenges to the Humanitarian Settlement Program over the past few years that have created needless issues and headaches for MRC as they worked to provide the necessary supports for refugees arriving in Northern Tasmania. Although there's not enough time to delve into the detail today, I'm committed to advocating for the necessary changes. I thank Minister Giles for his engagement with me on this issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, MRC, and happy 40th birthday.
