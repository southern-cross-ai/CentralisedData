        For more than 30 years, National Missing Persons Week has raised awareness of the issues surrounding missing persons and profiled long-term missing members of the community in hopes that answers may be found for loved ones left behind. This year's campaign, launched yesterday and running through to 6 August, is called Without Them, challenging each of us to identify with the missing, feel the weight of each missed year and consider our own emotional reaction to having a loved one go missing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I want to take this opportunity to bring awareness of the campaign and missing northern Tasmanians. According to Sergeant John Delpero of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Tasmania Police
        </a>
        Missing Persons Unit, around 125 people are reported missing in Tasmania each year. While over 97 per cent are located, there are still a small number each year who are not found safe and well. There are many well-known missing persons cases in Tasmania, including those of Nancy Grunwaldt and Lucille Butterworth. But I'd like to highlight some lesser-known cases in northern Tasmania in the hope that somebody may have some information that could be useful for Tasmania Police.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, 171 Tasmanians are reported missing in Tasmania, with Bruce Fairfax included in this list. Mr Fairfax was a beloved and respected teacher at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Church_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston Church Grammar School
        </a>
        , where he had taught for 29 years before he went missing while hiking with his wife, Louise, at the Duckhole Lake Track. As is the case for all loved ones left behind when someone goes missing, Bruce's disappearance has left a deep well of grief for his family, friends and colleagues, who are left to mourn his loss but without the certainty of knowing what happened and where he is.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to highlight a more recent case of a missing person from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        . Anthony Goodyer was 46 years old when he went missing on the afternoon of 4 February last year. He was last seen walking on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Tamar_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         East Tamar Highway
        </a>
        near George Town, wearing dark-coloured shorts, a dark T-shirt and tan work boots and carrying a shoulder bag. Mr Goodyer's is one of seven missing persons cases in the spotlight of Tasmania Police as part of the 2022 National Missing Persons Week, and I'm hopeful that someone may hold a crucial piece of information that may lead to finding Mr Goodyer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I wish to highlight the case of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mansell" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Mansell
        </a>
        , who was reported missing from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Island
        </a>
        on 8 August 2015, when he was 42 years old. Mr Mansell was last seen at Salmon Rocks, a popular recreational fishing spot; despite an extensive search, he has not been found. In 2020 a coroner determined that Mr Mansell had died in suspicious circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anyone with information can contact Tasmania Police on 131 444 or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Stoppers" rel="nofollow">
         Crime Stoppers
        </a>
        on 1800 333 000.
