        As a young kid growing up on our family farm in Sunraysia, I couldn't in my wildest dreams have imagined that one day I would see myself elected to this place and also sit on the House Standing Committee on Agriculture. I've always contended that the agriculture and horticulture industries are in my

        . As the old adage goes, 'From little things, big things grow.' That's very true of these industries, but it is particularly true of our seed industry.

        president award for his lifetime commitment to the seed industry. I'm grateful for the warm welcome and positive reception from those at the gala dinner, and in particular Rowena Petrie, the president of the Australian Seed Federationâ€”someone who I also bumped into yesterday in this building during the inaugural launch of the Parliamentary Friends of Australia's Organic Industry, headed up by none other than the member for Hunter and the member for Casey. I look forward to engaging with your industry and seeing it grow for years to come.
