        My question is to the Minister for Health on an issue that affects Australians. Will the minister outline to the House how the government's record in delivering a stronger economy enables the coalition to provide affordable access to life-changing medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and

        </a>
        ? Is the minister aware of any government that had an alternative approach to subsidising new medicines recommended by experts?

        <p>
         I want to thank the member for Goldstein, who has not just been a strong advocate for new medicines to be listed but is also a powerful student of economic history. He knows not so long ago there was a government that deferred the listings of new medicines, and I quote from the 2011 budget papers, 'Due to fiscal circumstances, the listing of some medicines would be deferred until fiscal circumstances permit.' This was from the last Labor government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a central figure.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thought to myself that it wasn't just economic incompetence; it was also a decision of their values. What happened in a similar period? Those opposite chose at the same time to subsidise pink batts. They chose, at the same time as they were stopping new medicines, to subsidise Green Loans. They chose, at the same time as they were stopping new medicines, to subsidise the Leader of the Opposition's favouriteâ€”cash for clunkers. So it's not just about competence; it's about values, it's about what you believe and it's about what you think is important. We think that supporting not just the economy but supporting Australians with essential services is fundamental. On that front the million jobs and more that we've been able to help create through the economic policies of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and all the members on this side of the House have meant that we can pay for the essential services. These essential services include the over 1,870 new medicines and amended listings that have come on our watch. Only this week we were able to talk about two new medicines, medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD" rel="nofollow">
          ADHD
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of rheumatoid arthritis, 22,000 Australian patients who sometimes suffer crippling pain and agonising conditions will have access to Olumiant. This is a medicine which would otherwise have cost up to $16,500 a year. It will now be available for $39.50 or $6.40 a script. Equally, over 140,000 Australian families will have access to Intuniv, a medicine for ADHD which would otherwise cost up to $1,900 a year. In other words, it is helping beautiful young children who have real challenges deal with their issues without the side effects which accompany so many other medicines in this space.
        </p>
        <p>
         So these two new medicines, one for a crippling condition and one for a condition which can have a deep impact on families and on educational attainment, will now be available. They will be subsidised under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
         </a>
         . You can only do that, as the member for Goldstein sets out, if you have a strong economy. And you can only do that if you have the right policies to do that. Above all, you can only do that if you believe in it.

           For the convenience of members, I advise that from today lift 39 in the House of Representatives wing, which is in the southern end of the inner corridor right near the Deputy Opposition Whip's office, is closed for refurbishment for about 15 weeks. I wouldn't want members to be caught out when there are divisions.
