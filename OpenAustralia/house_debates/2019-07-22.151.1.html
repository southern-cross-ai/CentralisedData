       <p>
        Labor election campaigns are people-driven campaigns, and I want to thank my campaigners in the 2019 election here today. In my electorate, around 200 volunteers put in countless hours to fight for a Labor government in the last election. Thank you to each and every one of you for your hard work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to the early morning risers—Julie-Ann, Geoff, Helen, Col, John and Conor—who braved cold early morning Melbourne train stations with me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to Emily, Dean, Adam, Simone, Valerie, Max, Tony, Sinead, Michael, John—again—Noni and Bruce, Noni's dog, for helping out at countless street stalls across my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, too, to the doorknockers and phone bankers: Louise, John, Terry—a first-time doorknocker—Noni, John, Claire, Anastasia, Elly and Owen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Campaigning shortly before winter in Melbourne is never fun, especially when you're standing out under the pouring rain wearing only a poncho to protect yourself. So, Freddie, thank you. You're a trouper for doing that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to the other pre-pollers who helped out at the Finnish Society of Melbourne in Altona and RecWest in

       </p>
       <p>
        To Bruce and his persimmons: I cannot be grateful enough for your help in handing out and setting up bunting, particularly so soon after your stint in hospital. Thank you, mate. You are indefatigable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to Conrad for being a star volunteer who brought skills as well as industry to the job, helping construct countless wooden A-frames, and who always went the extra mile to help out when needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to Tom, Terry, Matt, Bruce and the rest of the bunting squad, who stuck it out on the eve of the election. Your dedication to decorating voting booths will be remembered amongst the Labor faithful in Melbourne's west.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to everyone who was gracious enough to put my face in front of their houses: Eko, Trevor, Steph, Don, Jenny, Jill, Ian and Marcia, Yvette, Elwyn, Olly, Linelle, Rondah, Geoffrey, Cindy, Paddy, Julie, Marie, Dave, Leslie, Llewellyn and Carla.
       </p>

        A special shout-out to volunteers in

         Point Cook
        </a>
        , now a new part of my electorate, Christine, Ian, Martin, Alison, Sandy and Thomas, who were willing to drive from one side of the electorate to the other for training sessions and to pick up electoral material. Thank you to Paddy and the group for helping my staff organise the booths on election day and to all the booth captains who helped set up. The scrutineers have a difficult task and, in staying behind, they miss out on the election campaign party. Rosy, Cameron, Peter, Pam, Natali, Jess, Michael, Martin, John, Cindy, Paddy, Alison, Craig, Louise, Tom, Greg, Branwell, Bill, Simon, Julie Ann, Chris, Rennis, Mahesh, Col, Emily, Carl, Nick and Kemal: you are all legends. Thank you to Noni for racing from Point Cook to Newport. I thank all the 187 volunteers on election day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I think my staff—in particular, Raymond Pham and Kim Duong, who were with me every step of the way.

         That is probably a record for the most names mentioned in three minutes! I call the member for Berowra.
