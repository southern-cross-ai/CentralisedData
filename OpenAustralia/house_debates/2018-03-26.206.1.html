        I want to congratulate Ged Kearney, today affirmed into this place as the new member for Batman. It has been my great pleasure to be campaigning alongside her for the past several weeks, and I look forward to having a chance to work with her in this place not only on issues that are of concern to the electorates we both represent in the northern suburbs of Melbourne but also on matters of national concern. I am sure that she will make a great impact on national life in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also talk about the wonderful campaign that Ged ran, so ably led by Labor's assistant national secretary,

        . We built a campaign in Batman that brought so many people together in just cause, in a campaign which showed off all our candidate's qualities and also her capacity, and I think this capacity to effect real change is what pulled so many people into the campaign and what persuaded the electors of Batman to put their faith in Ged Kearney and Labor. And that is what's so important about the result in Batman the other day. It isn't just about electing a fantastic local MP; it is a big step towards changing the country, and Ged Kearney will be a major agent of effecting that change towards a more equal and more sustainable Australia.
