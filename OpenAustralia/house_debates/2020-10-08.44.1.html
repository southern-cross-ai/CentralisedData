       <p>
        The Queensland state election is just weeks away, and still the Queensland Labor government has failed the people of Brisbane's Bayside, with no commitment to fix the dangerous level crossing at Lindum. Two years ago, I delivered $85 million for a vital safety upgrade to this notorious level crossing and five-way intersection. However, with Queensland Labor failing to commit funds, I fear this upgrade may never come to fruition. Our Treasurer has warned states that if you don't use it you'll lose it. If Queensland Labor doesn't commit to fixing Lindum crossing, the failure to act now will be felt by motorists and commuters for years to come.

        I'm so disappointed by Queensland Labor's election commitment to provide $40 million in cosmetic upgrades to the Lindum station precinct. This is an appalling response after our $85 million commitment. When I delivered the $85 million federal funding for the Lindum crossing, it was to deliver a long-term, safe solution for all road users, in partnership with all levels of government. This $40 million for accessibility upgrades is nothing but a distraction from the fact that they won't commit what's needed to fix the Lindum crossing. The reason we know this is that, three years ago, they made a commitment of $5 million to upgrade the car park. If they can't upgrade the car park for $5 million, they can't deliver anything. State Labor, you should be ashamed.
