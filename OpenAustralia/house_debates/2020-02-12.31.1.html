        Today I am standing up for the 3,000 low-income households, 11,000 older people, 800 unemployed people, 1,700 single parent families and 12,000 people with a disability who are likely to feel the impact of the minister for social services's decision, made in secret and kept from the community, to close the Mornington Service Centre, with its Centrelink and Medicare services. No-one else is standing up for them, so I am.

        I wrote to the minister for social services on Friday on behalf of the Mornington community and my community asking for answers. We've received none. What are you doing to help vulnerable and elderly people from my electorate and the electorate of Flinders who need these services? And how many more service centres are going to close? I seek leave to table this letter.
