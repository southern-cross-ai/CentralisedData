        I'm really proud to call Brian Smiddy my friend, and I was so disappointed to miss his book launch the other day. But to hear about it and flick through the book's pages is something I want to share with this chamber. Brian Smiddy is an extraordinary man who has given so much in a life lived entirely selflessly. That was why more than a hundred people gathered together to celebrate his book launch with his local state member, Colin Brooks MP. Brian's book tells the story of his life in the Labor movement, and he spent 70 years—seven zero—as a member of the great
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">

        . He has spent his life dedicated to the values of unionism and to selflessness, making a difference everywhere he has gone. Brian has always lived his values and inspired those around him. I do feel very grateful for his support, and I was devastated that he was redistributed into the electorate of Jagajaga at the last redistribution. But the member for Jagajaga is a great beneficiary of his wisdom, as I continue to be. I'm so pleased that Brian has shared his story with the world, and I wish him and his wife Ellen, also a wonderful, selfless activist in the community, all the very best.

        I was able to join with many community members at Creeds Farm in

        just a couple of weeks ago to mark

         International Women's Day

        . I was so pleased that my staff brought together a group of incredible women to talk about some of the initiatives the government has embarked upon, led by Senator Gallagher. They also talked about local perspectives. To hear from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Haynes" rel="nofollow">

        from Whittlesea Community Connections and Meredith Budge from Lalor Neighbourhood House created some fantastic conversations. I was so pleased that a really diverse group of women was brought together. I was even more pleased that they weren't there just to listen; they were there to share their perspectives, demand more from our parliament in their communities and think about how they can be more active in the community in political, social, and economic life. Hearing the stories in that room and thinking about the conversations that have been generated through Alex and Meredith's wonderful contributions and leadership was a real privilege. I'm so grateful to the volunteers and, of course, to my staff for bringing together this important event. It was an opportunity to reflect on all that has been but also never to be satisfied until we have constructed a truly equal society in which everyone has every opportunity to contribute on their terms.
