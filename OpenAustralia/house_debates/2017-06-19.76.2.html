        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, on your visit in November last year it was reported on the front page of
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mercury" rel="nofollow">

        that you were 'very open, in fact enthusiastic' about a city deal for Hobart. Indeed, you extolled the virtues of the $400 million
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">

        centre and the light rail and said a city deal would coordinate investment for the city. But here we are, eight months later, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
         Lord Mayor
        </a>
        tells me that she has heard nothing since. Prime Minister, what have you done to make progress on a Hobart city deal? Have you held discussions with the Tasmanian state government? When can we expect something to happen?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. As the honourable member knows, my government is delivering for Tasmania. In terms of city deals, two months ago we signed a historic city deal agreement for Launceston. That was signed with the Premier and the Mayor of Launceston, demonstrating what can be done when all three levels of government come together. The centrepiece is a $260 million investment to move the University of Tasmania's main Launceston campus into the city centre. It is about much more than simply building a campus. It coincides with the city's heart-of-the-city redevelopment. It is about putting a new vibrancy into the centre of Launceston and will position it as one of Australia's most livable and innovative regional cities. It will boost the local economy by $360 million a year, creating over 2,700 new jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         So I can understand why the honourable member, who hails from Hobart, is keen to have a city deal in Hobart. I can understand that, and I have discussed it with the Premier. I can assure the honourable member that we would look forward to a city deal for Hobart, but we obviously need to work with the state and local governments. But we have demonstrated right around the country an enthusiasm for city deals. Of course, we have the Western Sydney City Deal and the Townsville City Deal, and there will be many others as we roll them out. Any plan would seek to maximise the opportunities for investment, jobs and growth from our significant infrastructure commitmentsâ€”

            <p>
             I would remind the honourable member that the budget has already locked in $1.1 billion in projects for Tasmania, and, in the honourable member's own electorate, we are providing $38 million towards the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart_Airport" rel="nofollow">
              Hobart Airport
             </a>
             runway extension. In fact, I was there only a little while ago, and that project has reached a very important milestone, allowing for the work to start on the final stage. Works will also shortly start to upgrade the Hobart Airport roundabout, for which we have provided $24 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             I look forward to further discussions with the Premier about a city deal for Hobart. We are certainly very open to it, but plainly we need to get the enthusiasm and commitment and engagement from the state government and the city government and other interested parties. I am sure the honourable member will lend his considerable powers of advocacy to supporting a city deal for Hobart.
