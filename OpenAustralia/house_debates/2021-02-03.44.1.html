        I rise today to speak about those who help our party and help this political process. Denise Jeitz, a lady from Dalby who joined the National Party in 1985, was instrumental in so many careers, including my own. Denise was not a person of fabulous wealth. She worked very hard for her local community. She held positions such as Treasurer. She held a long-time position on the women's branch of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">
         The Nationals
        </a>
        and then the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        . She was a strong member of the Warrego Electorate Council. But as a person she was always there, always an absolute friend and a staunch colleague. Unfortunately, her husband, Graham, died before her, as did her son, and she also had to manage other issues within her family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though so much was asked of her, Denise still gave to her nation. She was absolutely and utterly tireless in participating in the democracy of our nation. At one stage when she was ill, critically ill, she booked herself out of hospital—we thought that would be disastrous—and went on living for another couple of years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Next Wednesday I'll be attending the funeral of Denise Jeitz, and other pallbearers will also be people she helped. I want to thank Denise for her work. May she rest in peace.
