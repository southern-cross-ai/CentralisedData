       <p>
        I appreciate the opportunity to speak on indulgence and thank the Leader of the House. During my time as the home affairs minister, Ramzi Jabbour was a deputy commissioner of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        . I had regular contact with Mr Jabbour in that role. He regularly briefed me on significant issues, including national security matters. Mr Jabbour had always impressed me as a person of outstanding character. He served the Australian Federal Police for 29 years with great distinction.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Jabbour was subjected to an investigation and was subsequently totally cleared.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was anomalous to me at the time because the allegations were completely out of character with the person that I knew. It was also unfair because it precluded him at the time from being considered for the role of commissioner. He would have been a strong contender for that position. I'm pleased but not surprised that Mr Jabbour had no case to answer, and he should stand today as a proud example to his sons and the Australian community as a police officer who served his country with great distinction and integrity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to table a letter to Mr Jabbour from ACLEI, which states in part, 'All matters have now been finalised with no adverse findings against you.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table the letter.
       </p>
