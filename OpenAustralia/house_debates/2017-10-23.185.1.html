        I would like to congratulate the Brighton Calisthenics Club, which formally celebrates its 60th birthday this week. The club began in 1933, closed during World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        and was re-established in 1957, joining the Calisthenics Association that year, using its red and white colours. Calisthenics is an important sport for building both health and confidence in young girls and women. The word originates from the ancient Greek words for beauty and strength. Girls are taught the importance of teamwork, coordination, fitness, strength and flexibility, as well as presentation and preparation. My sister and I did calisthenics when we were young, and I can speak firsthand of the lessons it taught us. As I have previously stated, my grandmother also participated in calisthenics when she was young, and I wear her medal, engraved with her initials '

        ', which happen also to be the letters for the ultimate calisthenics prize, the Graceful Girl award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the Brighton Calisthenics Club on their continuing successâ€”60 years is a remarkable achievement for any club. I acknowledge the almost 100 young women who train and compete for Brighton Calisthenics and their parents, who take them to training and prepare the beautiful, intricate outfits they wear for competition. These are people like wardrobe mistress Joy Putman, who has three generations of her family involved in the club. I congratulate the club president, Amanda Carruthers, the hardworking committee, and the coaches for the work they do. Happy birthday to the Brighton Calisthenics Club.
