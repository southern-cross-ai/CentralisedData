         Graham Perkin
        </a>
        award for journalism in Melbourne last week for her key role in reporting child sexual abuse and institutional cover-up. Her work was pivotal in the establishment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Institutional Responses to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Sexual_Abuse" rel="nofollow">
         Child Sexual Abuse
        </a>
        , and for that I thank her.
       </p>
       <p>
        The announcement of the royal commission by the Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
         Julia Gillard
        </a>
        , was a landmark moment in our history. Many tears of relief were shed by victims and their loved ones in my community when they realised that the Prime Minister of their country understood—understood the betrayal, the hurt, the harm and the whole horror that is child abuse committed by those who had a care relationship: churches and institutions working with children. No doubt the royal commission will bring more pain and more tears, and that is why this government has amended legislation so that victims and witnesses are looked after throughout this process, allowing those affected by childhood sexual abuse to present their accounts in an informal setting in private sessions, and not under oath in a court-like system. Given the distressing and thoroughly evil nature of child sexual abuse, this is appropriate. Too much harm has already been done to too many young lives—harm that permeates their lives forever.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Hunter region there have been ongoing revelations of abuse and cover-up by powerful institutions, particularly the church. There is no greater breach of trust or betrayal of innocence than the abuse of a child by someone who is in a care or pastoral relationship. All children have a right to a safe and secure childhood, free from suffering at the hands of those in positions of trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        And of course we are talking not about doing wrong but committing a crime—abhorrent criminal activity that too many people tried to excuse by prioritising what they saw as a greater cause, such as the sanctity of the church. There is no greater cause than the care and protection of children. I am not a believer myself, but I know that 'Suffer the little children … unto me,' never meant, 'Make the children suffer because of me.' That is a great shame.
       </p>
       <p>
        Much of what has come to light has done so as a result of victims speaking out—whistleblowers—and through the diligent investigative reporting at local media outlets of people like Joanne McCarthy at the
        <i>
         Newcastle Herald
        </i>
        . The Prime Minister has said that this royal commission will change the nation. I hope so. And she has said that the
        <i>
         Herald
        </i>
        's campaign got into her head, saying that we have an obligation to shine a light on what has happened in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many years, Joanne has been investigating child sexual abuse and cover-up in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Region" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Region
        </a>
        and she has done so without fear or favour, as she should as a journalist. The
        <i>
         Newcastle Herald
        </i>
        's Shine the Light campaign has been instrumental in bringing to a head these heinous crimes, driving it into the national consciousness and prompting action from governments. She has personally told me of the solid support of her editors when they came under pressure. I thank them for their independence on this issue too.
       </p>
       <p>
        Almost on a daily basis, the
        <i>
         Herald
        </i>
        has reported on this issue. We have heard of paedophile priests leaving the country and of victims speaking out only after the perpetrators were deceased. We have heard of heartbreaking victim suicides and of families left behind. We all cared; we were all concerned. The Newcastle community rallied for action, with more than 400 locals attending a forum in Newcastle, a forum of tears, sadness and anger. The suicide of John Pirona, thought to be the 12th person to have taken his life after being abused by a priest in the Hunter, was a critical moment in this sad saga. His family and the community, and many others with similar experiences, said: 'Enough is enough.' I thank them for their strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joanne McCarthy rightly says that a royal commission means that the government recognises sexual abuse as an issue of public importance, and that, 'There isn't a group in society that is above the law.' That is the way it should be.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whistleblowers such as Detective Chief Inspector Peter Fox are also to be acknowledged for speaking out about these issues on a national level when it was not in the interests of his career. For that I thank him.
       </p>
       <p>
        There have been other commissions set up in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , and of course our royal commission is underway. These commissions will, and should, leave no stone unturned in their quest for answers and justice for victims and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joanne McCarthy has said that her award belongs to many, having met some of the most courageous and outstanding individuals in her life, many of whom will never be publicly identified but who chose to speak out. I congratulate Joanne. I congratulate the Prime Minister; the former Attorney-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Roxon" rel="nofollow">
         Nicola Roxon
        </a>
        ; and the current Attorney-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Dreyfus
        </a>
        , for their work.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must stamp out child abuse in all its forms, institutional and otherwise. For me, the victims, past and present, and their families do deserve justice. The task ahead of us is a long and difficult one. But it should be the beginning of a culture in this country of zero tolerance of any child abuse, and I hope that one day we will see the terrible exploitation of young people on the internet also addressed. So I do congratulate all the law agencies as well who have been involved in these investigations.
