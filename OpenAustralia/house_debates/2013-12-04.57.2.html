                   My question is to the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to the international findings that have recorded Australia's worst result in literacy, numeracy and science, despite an increase of 44 per cent in education funding and smaller class sizes over the last decade.

                     Obviously an uneducated opposition. I refer the minister to the international findings that have recorded Australia's worst result in literacy, numeracy and science, despite an increase of 44 per cent in education funding and smaller class sizes over the last decade. Minister, what is the government doing to address the sliding standards in Australian schools that it inherited from the previous government?

They are the worst results by a long chalk. Between 2009 and 2010, Australia's ranking in the

                           This is despite the fact that over the period of the previous Labor government they spent almost $20 billion in new spending on things like school halls and laptops and computers.

                           cost the taxpayer almost $20 billion. In real terms they increased education spending by 10 per cent, and in that period they were entirely responsible for a drop in the education outcomes of our Australian students. The Leader of the Opposition was out there today blaming the Howard government. Not only is the Leader of the Opposition a government change denier; he is now a Gillard government denier. Apparently it never happened. They are like the

                           years—the last six years never occurred. There was no Rudd government, there was no Gillard government. There is no way that the opposition can get away from the fact that from 2006 to 2013 they were in power. These

                           funding model. The SES funding model, which Labor say they hate, delivered 10 per cent more spending to schools in real terms in that period and results declined. Why did they decline? It was because of Labor's complete failure to recognise that money is not everything in education. It is about teacher quality, it is about a robust curriculum, it is about parental engagement, it is about principal autonomy and it is about discipline. Labor always completely misses the point on education. They think if you throw more money at a problem it will be solved. The PISA results today indicate that that is completely false—you can spend more and more money, which they insist on doing, but unless you get teacher quality right you will not bring about better outcomes. PISA also found that in Australia it was teacher quality that was the No. 1 determinant of student outcomes. It said that it did not matter what school you went to; it mattered which teacher your class was allocated.

                            Last week our friend the Minister for Education said he did not believe there was an equity problem in Australian schools. Today experts say there is in fact an equity problem in Australian schools. Prime Minister, who can Australians trust—the international experts or your education minister?
