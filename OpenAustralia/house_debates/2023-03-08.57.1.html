        My question is to the Minister for Government Services. I refer to the minister 's comments yesterday on Sky News about the attack on franking credits from this government, and the attack on franking credits he proposed in the 2019 election. Has the minister reflected on the difference between his honesty in 2019, which saw him lose an election, and the Prime Minister's dishonesty which saw him win an election?

          I submit that the question is out of order on a number of grounds. Certainly, the tag at the end is something that can only be made by direct resolution, not through the form of a question. And, in terms of the policy carriage of the issue, it's not directed to the accurate minister.

            The question relates directly to comments that the minister made in the media yesterday. The principle is well established, that a minister can be asked questions about comments that he or she has made publicly. If there are concerns about the last sentence then the member ought to be given the opportunity to rephrase the question.

             <p>
              In respect to the point that the Manager of Opposition Business just made about whether a comment that someone makes can automatically be asked about during question time: the reference to that in the
              <i>
               Practice
              </i>
              is specifically when it refers to a previous portfolio. That's on the basis that you can't ask someone about something other than their portfolio. You can only ask about a previous portfolio if they've made a statement on it. To say that if they make a statement on any policy at all it suddenly becomes open slather in question time. It would be a brand-new precedent that we've never had.

                about the attack on franking credits from this government and the attack on franking credits he proposed in the 2019 election. Has the minister reflected more broadly across his portfolio responsibilities on the difference between his honesty in 2019 when he spoke about franking credits which saw him lose an election and the Prime Minister's dishonesty which saw him win an election, a dishonesty that covers every portfolio in this government?

                    Thanks for the robodebt question, Sussan. One important point which goes to this question of honesty in government is really this: there have been a lot of witness statements given by a lot of victims of robodebt in the royal commission and they do make harrowing reading. I'm not sure that the memberâ€”

                         The robodebt royal commission is casting a light on matters which haven't been dealt with before the royal commission. The members opposite, I think, are aware that for 4Â½ years there was an unlawful scheme raisedâ€”an unlawful scheme. And as much as the members opposite don't like to talk about the robodebt royal commission, part of the reason why we are having the royal commission is for 4 Â½ years the then government did everything they could to bury the truth. We have heard in a number of question timesâ€”oh, my goodness.

                           As the Manager of Opposition Business and members of the opposition know, the question they've asked goes to all areas of honesty across the portfolio. That is what the question goes to. So, therefore, drawing on material about that doesn't have to draw on whether or not there will be a particular conclusion from the royal commission. The question of those opposite has given us a much broader way of asking those questions.

                             The robodebt royal commission is necessary because, after 4Â½ years of breaking the law, the old government never actually explained how it happened. We've had the harrowing statements from witnesses. We've had countless statements from victims. At last count, there were about 400,000 victims of the previous government's illegality. This goes very much to the honesty of services.

                             solicitor said the scheme was unlawful. That's already a fact. But has anyone on that side stopped to think, 'How did we keep breaking the law for 4Â½ years?' Coalition members may see this as just a partisan issue, but, if we don't understand why it happened and how it happened, so far what we've had is a lot of people saying, 'I don't recall.' But I contrast the honesty of the victims who are bravely retelling their stories with the cowardice of theâ€”
