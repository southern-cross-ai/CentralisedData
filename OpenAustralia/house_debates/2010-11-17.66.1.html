        My question is to the Prime Minister. In the gallery today there are three young women who are anxiously awaiting the government’s listing of the life-saving drug Soliris. One of those young women, Jenny, is forced to have three blood transfusions every month. Since the Prime Minister came to office, two young Australians have lost their lives as a result of an insidious disease. Given that the government has wasted billions of dollars on the home insulation and school building schemes—

           say to the young people in the gallery that the member refers to: of course I am concerned about their personal circumstances. Of course, as Prime Minister, I am concerned about their circumstances. I am concerned about the circumstances of any Australian, particularly any young Australian, who is battling illness and disease. I am very concerned about that. The government, through what it does—funding health—wants to be able to assist people in the best way possible. I also say to the young people in the gallery, and to the member, that there is a longstanding bipartisan process for dealing with the listing of pharmaceuticals. That longstanding process is that we do not have politicians pick which medicines should go on the list. We have medical experts work through the

             Perhaps I could say the next sentence. When they make a positive recommendation—and this was true under the Howard government too, so settle back down—the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
              Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee
             </a>
             deals with the medical issues and makes a recommendation. Then the question of price is worked through by a pricing authority. It happened every time under the Howard government as well—to those members who are so excited about the question. Then government makes decisions on the basis of that. The Leader of the Opposition well knows this. He would well recall that when he was minister for health there were some celebrated examples of long-term delay in funding medicines. I just want to point that out to members opposite, because I think that is something they should contemplate—that this has been an issue in the past. Obviously, for the three young people in the gallery, I am very happy to receive any material from them that they would like me to see—

               I am very, very happy to receive any material from them. I am very happy to hear from them personally. I say to them that the government does have a proper process here. It is a process that has been gone through by governments in the past. These young people have our personal best wishes, compassion and support. What we do not want to see in this parliament—and what I think members of goodwill would hold themselves out against—is the politicising of questions like this one.
