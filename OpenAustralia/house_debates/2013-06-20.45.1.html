        Community spirit is alive and well in the electorate of Brisbane, and nowhere was this more apparent that in a jam-packed weekend of events last weekend. On Saturday the Zonta Inaugural Fashion Showcase fundraiser was held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Hall
        </a>
        , where four clubs came together. I want to acknowledge a local resident, Flora Di Lizio, and her committee for their prized organisation. Flora is probably one of the best raffle ticket sellers I have ever seen. The purpose of this event was to support Project

        </a>
        , which helps make a difference to the lives of women in Queensland suffering from drug, alcohol and gambling addiction. The Zonta Club membership is made up of women from a diverse range of ages, experiences, professions and backgrounds, and they do absolutely fantastic work in advancing the status of women through local fundraising, service and fellowship.

        Saturday was also the day of the Racecourse Road Winter Lights Festival in Hamilton. I want to thank Councillor David McLachlan for the

        funding and also the Brisbane Airport Corporation's Julieanne Alroe for their sponsorship. This year's Winter Lights Festival had a new and exciting look about it, a new feel. There were a number of performances along with the road. They had an interactive atmosphere for both businesses and audiences and the festival continues to provide a showcase for local musicians and performers to connect to their community. All enjoyed the wonderful parade of the lights for the first time ever. It was wonderful to see so many families.
