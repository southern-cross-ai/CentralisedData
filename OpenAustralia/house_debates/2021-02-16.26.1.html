       <p>
        It's a pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to the most recognisable face in Northern Tasmania, Police Commander Brett Smith, who wrapped up almost 40 years of distinguished frontline service with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Tasmania Police
        </a>
        last month. Having joined as a fresh-faced 18-year-old, he held positions in the criminal and investigation drug squad units as well as search and rescue, counterterrorism and country positions. Having managed a number of crises in his long career, from floods to bushfires and COVID-19, it's perhaps his position as radio-room supervisor on Sunday 28 April 1996 that has proved to be one of the most significant and traumatic days he has faced.
       </p>
       <p>
        On this day, then Sergeant Smith was responsible for organising the police response to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        tragedy, while also fielding triple zero calls that were flooding in. Appointed the northern commander role in 2014, Smith said that it was his strong sense of community in the Northern Tasmania region that kept him in frontline services. His involvement in the police force has earned him the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        , the National Police Service Medal, a national medal for 35 years and the Commissioner's Medal for 30 years of service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having spent almost two decades in mentoring and staff development, Commander Smith will continue building on this passion by undertaking a secondment to the Australian Institute of Police Management in Sydney. Thank you, Brett, for your dedication to Tasmania Police and the communities you served across the state for so long, particularly the Northern Tasmania community.
