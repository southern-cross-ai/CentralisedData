         The English
        </a>
        language is the passport to success in this country. Without it, migrants to our country are limited in their choices, limited in their opportunity and limited in their ability to communicate and successfully integrate into our country. The last of my family to come to Australia arrived here from Germany in 1936. Anyone who has travelled to another country where a language other than English is spoken might appreciate just how difficult it is to communicate and complete everyday tasks, but few of us can comprehend the immense hurdle that moving to a foreign country and having to learn a new language presents. The ability to speak English gives people greater independence and increases economic and social participation in the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Adult Migrant English Program—or the AMEP, as I will call it—is the Australian government's largest settlement program, providing up to 510 hours of English language tuition to eligible new migrants and humanitarian entrants to help them learn foundation English language and settlement skills. I acknowledge my friend the member for Cowan, who I know used to be a teacher in the program. The AMEP is available to all eligible visa holders 18 years of age and over who do not have full proficiency in English.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since its establishment in 1948, the AMEP has helped more than a million new arrivals gain the linguistic skills they need to fully participate in all aspects of Australian life. But this is only one million out of the over 7½ million people who have settled here since the first federal Immigration portfolio was created in 1945. Last year alone, more than 59,000 new migrants benefited from the training delivered by the AMEP. Despite this increase in participation, the 2011 census revealed that there were more than half a million Australians who reported that they could not speak English well, or they could not speak it at all. Of those people, more than a quarter of a million had been here since before 1996, and those figures are probably underestimated. All of this shows that more needs to be done.
       </p>
       <p>
        My electorate has migrants from China, India,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lanka
        </a>
        , Korea, Lebanon, Armenia, Greece, Italy and the Philippines. The 2011 census revealed that there were approximately 3½ thousand people who spoke little or no English in my electorate. This is an issue that disproportionately affects women, with three-fifths of those census respondents with little or no English being women. The social isolation of some Chinese and Indian migrants, particularly in my electorate—particularly older people and stay-at-home mums—is a key issue facing our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2014, the federal education department reviewed the AMEP and found that the program would benefit from improvements that focused on individual client outcomes, particularly employment and improved community participation. As a result, the government has created two streams of tuition: the pre-employment English stream and the social English stream. Both streams will include mandatory units on Australian laws, culture and values, with specific units for young people under age 24. Mandatory entry and exit assessments and regular assessments every 200 hours of tuition will provide better monitoring of client progress. Teachers will have to have a three-year Australian undergraduate degree and a postgraduate Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages qualification.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new AMEP model will mean migrants are better supported in their English studies and will provide more choice for how and when and at what pace students can learn. The changes will also assist migrants to achieve the English language requirements under the new citizenship test. At present, only a basic knowledge of English is required for citizenship, and this is not assessed through a standalone test. The proposed citizenship test raises this standard.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is providing more than $1.2 billion over the forward estimates to deliver the AMEP at around 250 locations across Australia.

       </p>
       <p>
        Sunny Suqin Sun recently moved to Australia from China and is a student at the Hornsby TAFE. Through the AMEP, Sunny has enrolled in a beginner English bilingual class and is learning how to use public transport, ask for directions and make appointments so she can more fully participate in everyday Australian life. She says this method of English is 'a memorable and exciting thing'. She says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The class is like a family - The teacher makes the class very enjoyable - I feel relaxed and happy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will be visiting the Hornsby TAFE in the near future to see this program firsthand. The Adult Migrant English Program will help reduce social isolation, create greater economic opportunities and provide a pathway to citizenship for many in our multicultural communities. I commend the AMEP.

         <p>
          I am happy to second the motion. I rise in support of the private member's motion on the Adult Migrant English Program, which has been brought for debate here in the Chamber by the member for Berowra. Australia is indeed a very, very diverse society. It is predominantly an English-speaking multicultural country that has relied on successive waves of migration to assist in its nation-building capacity. Migrants from every corner of the world have settled here. They have brought with them their hopes and their aspirations, but they have also brought their cultural and linguistic inheritance and their faiths, making Australia one of the most diverse societies in the world.
         </p>
         <p>
          Many new migrants come to our country with fluent English, others with functional English and many without any English language at all. Their circumstances of arrival are varied, many coming under the skilled migration program and others under the refugee and humanitarian program. The importance of speaking English for a new migrant can never be underestimated, therefore, as it impacts on their capacity not only to get a job but also to negotiate everyday activities that many of us English speakers take for granted, activities such as answering the telephone, filling in forms, using public transport, being able to communicate with doctors and the police, enrolling their children in schools and speaking with teachers, being able to communicate with shop assistants and in general understanding and communicating with the broader community.
         </p>
         <p>
          In my own community of Calwell, which has been receiving waves of migration since the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
           Second World War
          </a>
          —since the abolition of the white Australia policy and, more recently, under the humanitarian refugee program—English language teaching and training through the AMEP program is an important service, and never more so now given the large number of refugees we are receiving from Syria. All new migrants to a country want to hit the ground running from the moment they get here, and being able to communicate is central to being able to do that.
         </p>
         <p>
          Knowledge of the English language was recognised as a critical enabler as far back as 1946, but it was in 1948 that the AMEP was established to assist the integration of the mass migration programs of the Curtin and Chifley governments. As the forerunners to multicultural Australia, these nation-building leaders were defined by the vision of Australia's first immigration minister
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Calwell" rel="nofollow">
           Arthur Calwell
          </a>
          . Calwell and his contemporaries understood that the new Australians needed to learn English in order to assist their integration. English language classes, therefore, were made mandatory for new migrants. The program was a six-week English language program delivered in the migrant reception centres of Bonegilla, at first, after which people were placed into jobs. Calwell's new Australians, by and large, have been a success story in our nation-building capacity and the AMEP program has been an important factor in that success.
         </p>
         <p>
          Today's AMEP program not only continues to be relevant but has an even more critical role to play in helping new migrants' participation with an even greater focus on preparation for employment, because the nature of contemporary employment and opportunities for migrants in Australia has changed immensely. With the decline of manufacturing in this country, which once provided employment opportunities for many migrants in low-skilled jobs and where English in the workplace did not determine whether they got the job or not, today's workforce has become more technologically advanced, automated and innovative in a way that requires a highly skilled workforce, with English being absolutely necessary, even with the process of applying for a job online and having a digital
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CV" rel="nofollow">
           CV
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The AMEP program is central to our world-class settlement service program. We are, in fact, considered world leaders in integrating migrants. Providing access and equity to new migrants is part of an overall democratic society, such as the one in which we live, and learning the English language is an overarching measure for social cohesion of migrants.
         </p>
         <p>
          Currently, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration is conducting an inquiry into migrant settlement outcomes. One of our terms of reference specifically deals with 'the importance of English language ability on a migrant's, or prospective migrant's, settlement outcome.' As the deputy chair of the committee, I am very excited about this inquiry because it gives the parliament an opportunity to further review our settlement programs and services, especially the AMEP, to see if there are, indeed, any issues and, if so, to make recommendations to address them.
         </p>
         <p>
          Currently, the AMEP provides 510 hours of English language, with an additional 490 hours added to the program as from 1 July 2017 for those who have shown good progress and attendance records. This stipulation, however, could serve to disadvantage those who cannot, for legitimate reasons, attend classes. Some of the evidence that was submitted to the committee attests to that. Indeed, our recent Melbourne public hearing was conducted at the

          </small>
          <p>
           I would like to rise to support the motion put forward by my good friend the member for Berowra, who is was doing a magnificent job in his own electorate and making a fine contribution to the service of the nation. He has put this motion forward because he understands the importance of Australia's migration program as part of the enduring vision of building this country's future.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australia's postwar immigration program has been a phenomenal success. We continue to be seen as one of the most attractive liberal democracies in the world for people seeking a new way of life, and we are proud to call so many people new Australians. They come here because of the opportunities that this country provides, the seeking of our way of life, the pursuit of our shared values and the promise of a nation underpinned by the principles of an opportunity society. There are many who wish to share and contribute to our success as a nation, and we must do everything we can to encourage and preserve that unique fortune.
          </p>
          <p>
           For these people to be able to build on the trajectory of this country and be part of its future success, Australians expect the government to adequately equip new citizens with the ability to thrive and prosper in society. We should want new Australians to make sure that they harness that opportunity for their own success as well as the shared success of this country. New citizens and the government have a shared obligation to remove all barriers to full participation in our wider society, and we should encourage new Australians to understand and embrace the values and ethos of our magnificent country. After all, these values make us the envy of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
           A common language plays a crucial role in uniting a disparate country. It forms the basis of our shared history and our culture and, more importantly, our future together. The success of the Adult Migrant English Program in educating new Australians is a very important part of uniting Australians in that education. The AMEP provides up to 510 hours of English-language tuition to eligible new Australians and humanitarian entrants. It is a pathway to learn the foundations of the English language alongside settlement skills to enable new Australians to participate socially and economically in our society. Through language tuition, the program aims to produce outcomes in relation to social participation, economic wellbeing and the improvement of people's welfare and, more importantly, independence and personal wellbeing. All of these contribute to settlement within and integration into the Australian broader community. The program also assists new Australians to find pathways to employment.
          </p>
          <p>
           A recent evaluation found that overall the AMEP is a valuable program that is 'providing substantial assistance to eligible adult migrants and humanitarian entrants'. It offers 'a strong focal point for drawing together a range of humanitarian and other related settlement services'. The work experience component of the AMEP has a higher rate of participation than similar programs, including the Skills for Education and Employment program.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government, rightly, is actively supporting the continued success of AMEP by revising the business model as part of last year's budget. Some key features of the new business model include providing access to a capped program of 490 hours of additional tuition for clients who have not reached functional English after completing their entitled 510 hours; removing the funding cap applied to the AMEP subprogram, the Special Preparatory Program, allowing entrants to access additional training; and expanding choice and increasing flexibility and innovation in service delivery by allowing providers to choose a curriculum that best meets their clients' needs.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that the program has a significant impact on people's lives. A 2011 survey found that more than 50 per cent of participants were well on their way to achieving economic independence by indicating that they would likely buy a house in the next five years. More than one quarter of both migrants and refugees, those seeking a life as new Australians, aspired to start up their own business within the next five years, something that should be utterly celebrated and congratulated, I would hope in a bipartisan way, by everybody in this chamber. A third of participants were actively involved in local community groups, a religious organisation, a community group, a sporting club or a parenting group. Those groups provide the knitting of the social fabric that binds our community together. And 61 per cent of those with children said that their child participated in activities outside school, most commonly in sporting groups.
          </p>
          <p>
           We acknowledge the fantastic work that AMEP providers deliver to our newest Australians. I wish all 59,000 recent participants in the program the very best going forward.
          </p>

           <p>
            I would like to start by thanking the member for Berowra for bringing this motion to the Federation Chamber. It is indeed a motion that I am very proud to stand up and speak to. I particularly also to thank my colleague for acknowledging that I actually do have a long history with the Adult Migrant English Program. I am a trained
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TESOL" rel="nofollow">
             TESOL
            </a>
            teacher and taught with the Adult Migrant English Program for some years, so I was very keen to come to speak to this particular motion.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would be remiss of me to stand here and speak to this motion without raising some of the concerns that my colleagues that are still teaching in the Adult Migrant English Program have with regard to the proposed changes to the Adult Migrant English Program and how it is delivered, specifically around the division of the Adult Migrant English Program into two streams: the pre-employment and social English streams. The fundamental flaw with this change, even though we are very supportive—and I, particularly, am very supportive of the changes that are being made to the pre-employment stream—is that it really misinterprets the English language needs of all clients, particularly those with low or no literacy skills.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I was a teacher at the Adult Migrant English Program, I specialised in teaching clients with low or no literacy skills—clients who came with an ISLPR of zero. ISLPR is the International Standard Language Proficiency Rating, which is used by the Adult Migrant English Program to assess people who are eligible for the program and to put them in the correct English language class for their abilities. I specialised in low or no literacy skills. I had a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Education" rel="nofollow">
             Master of Education
            </a>
            specialising in TESOL as well as several years experience as a TESOL teacher. Those kinds of clients, those with particular needs, require highly skilled teachers. They require somebody who has high skills in teaching English as a second language.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the issues that has been raised, particularly in the submission by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Council
            </a>
            of TESOL Associations, is that the class sizes for the social skills stream is 25, as opposed to 20, which is what it will be in the pre-employment stream. The other issue is that the social skills stream can be taught by either accredited or non-accredited teachers. In other words, the social stream to be delivered through the AMEP with these changes can be delivered by non-qualified TESOL teachers—people who do not have those qualifications that are required in the TESOL stream specifically to teach people with zero or low literacy skills. As I said, there are specific skills that are required to teach that level. The outcome, therefore, is that it is going to have an adverse impact, particularly on women and on refugees, who tend to come in with much lower literacy skills, and on refugee women in particular, who often are illiterate or have limited literacy in their own language as well.
           </p>
           <p>

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTA" rel="nofollow">
             ACTA
            </a>
            , which, as I mentioned earlier, is the Australian Council of TESOL Associations, made these points in a detailed submission to the AMEP. Dr Michael Michell, the president of the ACTA, said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Without expert teaching, refugees' and migrants' once-in-a-lifetime English entitlement will be wasted. The best these classes can produce will be stigmatised speakers of 'broken' English on a road to discrimination, unemployment and social isolation.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            This downgrading directly contradicts the findings of the Government's most recent review of the AMEP.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the other findings with this is that we need to understand that 28 per cent of AMEP clients, which is a vast majority, leave the program with a zero or zero-plus ISLPR. These are the lowest levels of literacy. Only seven per cent leave with an ISLPR of two, which is considered basic proficiency. Even so, an ISLPR of two is way below the necessary requirements that are proposed for the citizenship test, which are an
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IELTS" rel="nofollow">
             IELTS
            </a>
            6. An IELTS 6 is pretty much academic English; an ISLPR 2 is basic communication skills.
           </p>
           <p>
            In closing, I would urge the government to reconsider the way that it is approaching the AMEP and recognise the professionalism of the teachers.

            <p>
             It is with much pride that I rise today to discuss the Turnbull government's changes to the Adult Migrant English Program, which aims to promote and support the learning of English language skills through the provision of timely quality English language services. The primary objective of the program is to produce outcomes in relation to social participation, independence, personal and economic wellbeing, all of which contribute to successful settlement into the broader Australian community.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government announced changes to the AMEP that provide a business model that places greater emphasis on English language proficiency for work, education and participation in the community, to build on our being the most successful multicultural nation on this earth. Two streams of tuition will now be available within a client's 510-hour entitlement: the pre-employment English stream and the social English stream. The nature of the pre-employment stream is to deliver English language tuition in the context of life in Australia, specifically in the workplace, and to provide skills for further education The nature of the social English stream is to deliver English language tuition in a less-formal setting to enable people to independently participate in the community. AMEP providers are based across my electorate of Chisholm—in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Hill" rel="nofollow">
              Box Hill
             </a>
             , Chadstone and Oakleigh, which people can readily access.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Chisholm, over 136 languages are spoken every day, so some would not blink an eye at the following scene that took place in Box Hill, but that, for me, made memories come flooding back. A young child was alternating between speaking Mandarin and English, acting as interpreter for whom I assumed to be her grandmother. The scene took me back to when I was about the same age, in the early 70s. I got on the bus with my grandma, of Greek heritage, and an aggressive overbearing bus driver yelled at her to 'speak English' to tell him our location. Intuitively, my child's voice blurted it out, and I felt relieved and empowered that I had saved the day for my grandma, and, more importantly, I had stopped my grandmas obvious intense anxiety. My maternal grandparents settled in Australia in the 1930, so this event happened well over thirty years on but my grandma still could not speak English . Grandpa could though, as he was the front man for their small business.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a typical Australian migrant story that, unfortunately, remains relevant today. Grandma was like many migrant women then and to this day who stay in the home, behind the scenes, and not in situations that compel them to speak or learn English. Consequently they often cannot pursue financial independence, actively participate in the workforce, access services, or learn to drive. Their independence is significantly restrained.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are many migrants, particularly women, who are likely still in this predicament. Our ageing population necessarily includes an ageing migrant population. Speaking to my constituents in Chisholm, one of the most worrying concerns for them is the isolation felt, particularly by their mothers and grandmothers as their partners have passed away, which is enhanced by the fact that they cannot speak English.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those on the other side who are struggling to find the negatives in the Turnbull government's new citizenship reforms have their blinkers on and their arguments do not make sense. 'Oh, there are so many people who are Australian citizens now who have made a contribution and who wouldn't have passed the English test. It ain't broke, so don't fix it.' Indeed, it 'ain't broke'. We are the most successful multicultural nation on earth. This is not about fixing something; rather, it is a concept that builds on our liberal democracy, of what would be described in the business world as 'continuous improvement', upon which the Turnbull government is delivering.
            </p>
            <p>
             These reforms are aligned to a modern Australia. Moreover, in a modern Australia our values do not condone anything that undermines women's equality to men. In certain other countries they do, and they still do: forced marriages, genital mutilation, permission for violence against women.
            </p>
            <p>
             Part of the beauty and vibrancy of Australia's diversity is that we can freely and openly express our different cultures through different languages, the key source of communication between people. However, speaking English is intrinsically linked to our Australian culture and way of life and therefore a necessary skill. Equal opportunity for men and women is a hallmark of Liberalism and the modern overlay of requiring people to pass an English test is a core element of our citizenship reforms. It aligns to the fact that the ability to speak English is key to integrating into our community and participating in the workforce. It creates independence and enables access to any services.
            </p>
            <p>
             Disagreeing with change or reform for the political sake of it, as Labor does on a daily basis, does nothing to protect our great nation for future generations. The Turnbull government's strengthening of our citizenship laws are pragmatic and sensible reforms, whilst harnessing the integrity of a multicultural Australia. They convey that to call Australia home, and to be part of our Australian family, one must be able to speak our language, obey our laws and respect our values.

              I want to start off by saying that I appreciate the sentiment with the member for Berowra brings with this motion to this chamber, the commitments that he made and the importance he placed on the Adult Migrant English Program in his contribution. I also would like to endorse very strongly the comments of my colleague the member for Cowan on the very great importance of having properly qualified teachers working in these programs. Teaching language literacy and numeracy is actually one of the most demanding teaching tasks. I am a former

              teacher myself, and I can assure you that the qualifications and professionalism are significantly important to successful outcomes. So I endorse the contribution by the member for Cowan.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do want to say that I am a bit sad to be speaking on a negative aspect of this particular debate, but I want to bring before the chamber the situation in my own electorate. Indeed, I am joined by my friend the member for Newcastle, who has a similar situation. I have spoken to the Assistant Minister for

              </a>
              and Skills on this, and I thank her for meeting with me about it. On 18 April this year, the assistant minister announced successful tenderers for the new Adult Migrant English Program and the Skills for Education and Employment Program. In my area, TAFE Illawarra, which extends down to the far
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
               South Coast
              </a>
              , and Hunter TAFE, in my colleague's area, have lost the contract for the AMEP to Navitas English. We learnt last week that Navitas now plans to subcontract that delivery to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAX" rel="nofollow">
               MAX
              </a>
              Solutions, so we have a contract to a subcontractor. Neither of whom have the facilities, teaching staff or anything that is required to deliver the program in place. It is supposed to commence on 1 July and so local students will be forced to move from TAFE to Navitas English, now MAX Solutions, on that date. They have not received any information as yet as to where the new premises will be located or how it is going to operate for them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many students in my area—about 40 of them—had gathered very quickly on the day that I was going out to talk to Mr Rob Long from the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
               NSW
              </a>
              Teachers Federation about these matters because they were so distressed and angered by the decision that they wanted to talk to me directly. They told me that they have actually taken out rental arrangements—so they have leases in place—and chosen accommodation that allowed them to be close to the TAFE so that they could walk there and make sure they never miss their lessons. They have enrolled their children in the local schools. The TAFE has a childcare centre, and they have younger children enrolled at child care. The TAFE provides many ongoing educational opportunities, and I met students who had done the AMEP and then continued on to do vocational qualifications in aged care and hospitality—all able to be done at that campus.
             </p>
             <p>
              The TAFE itself, I have been informed, had a
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
               AAA
              </a>
              rating for their delivery for many, many years of this very Commonwealth contract. I am, like the students and the teachers, completely at a loss as to why you would take the contract off TAFE, who has been delivering it, who has all those facilities in place, who has trained teachers available to do deliver it and who has met all—above and beyond—of its contract requirements to date.

              <p>
               I thank the member for Berowra for raising this very important topic for debate. The Adult Migrant English Program is an excellent part of our immigration system and one which allows new residents who come to our country to learn our language. It is not, however, a program that is well known in our communities and it is underutilised as a result. I hope this debate will raise more attention to this wonderful system.
              </p>
              <p>
               The AMEP has been around for nearly 60 years now. It aims to promote and support the learning of English-language skills through the provision of timely and quality English-language services. Of course, it is vital for our communities and our international relations that migrants retain elements of the language and culture from their motherlands. It creates the vibrant communities that are on show in places like Eastwood in my electorate. However, it is undeniable that competency in English increases the chances for social participation, independence, personal and economic wellbeing. All of these contribute to an individual's success for settlement into the broader Australian community.

               It is easy to forget how a lack of English proficiency can impact people beyond just holding conversations. Migrants have told me, before they learnt English, how their health suffered because they were intimidated by the booking systems for doctors' appointments. They could not get around because they did not understand road signs or public transport timetables. Lack of English was crippling their wellbeing.

               We have a number of local English-language schools in my electorate and all do excellent work in improving the social and employment chances for their students. The Australian Chinese Cultural Association of New South Wales' Chinese-language school, for example, last year celebrated their 40th anniversary. The principal, Dr Phil Xu, runs a vital service and makes a fantastic contribution to our local community, which is evident for all to see.

               campus. It provides 510 hours of English classes, which amounts to nearly 15 weeks of full-time classes. As the motion states, last year more than 59,000 new migrants and humanitarian entrants benefited from training developed by the AMEP. While all clients are seeking to learn or improve their English, many clients are seeking sustainable employment and would benefit from a stronger employment focus in their English-language training and exposure. Others are seeking greater competency in English to help to participate more independently in the local community and region.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many clients also wish to participate in employment concurrently with AMEP. Recent reforms have therefore divided the hours into two essential streams: the pre-employment English stream and the social English stream. Crucially, the streams can be adjusted so that the system suits those looking for work or those who need to help adjusting into their new social surroundings. Recent changes have made further important updates to the system. Both streams will include mandatory units on Australian laws, culture and values. There will also be specific units for younger people under 24 years of age who have different needs in their use of language to their older counterparts. Importantly, there is now also the facility for up to an additional 490 hours of English tuition where clients have accessed their full entitlement but are yet to achieve functional English. This will ensure that nobody is left behind. We are encouraging greater flexibility and innovation in where and how services are delivered.

               Bennelong is very fortunate to be enriched with cultures from around the globe. These communities have had great success in finding a balance between integrating into the Australian way of life and retaining important aspects of the many cultures and thus fusing disparate communities into a unique but strong local identity. Understanding our language is essential to getting a job, receiving services or having a social life. The Adult Migrant English Program is helping thousands of people settle into their new country, and I recommend the program to all new residents of this great nation.

                Like my colleagues, I thank the member for Berowra for bringing this motion before the House. It is certainly an opportunity for us to speak to the importance of the AMEP. I thank the members on the government benches for acknowledging the importance of this program, but I absolutely share the concerns raised by my colleague the member for Cunningham, who joins us here today and has spoken on this motion as well, about some very serious consequences that are beginning to emerge as a result of recent decisions of the government regarding the contracts as to who will deliver the AMEP in our respective regions.

                , in addition to Illawarra TAFE, will no longer have contracts to deliver these programs in our regions, despite an outstanding track record of delivery of these services. Yesterday I celebrated with my community
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_Day" rel="nofollow">
                 Africa Day
                </a>
                . It was the third occasion on which we had celebrated Africa Day in Newcastle. It is a relatively new festival for our region. But it was also the 10th anniversary of the Hunter African Communities Council. At that festival I got to meet with many, many people who have been the beneficiaries and recipients of the AMEP through the Hunter TAFE. I met with TAFE teachers, expert linguists who have been working in the TAFE facilities and a whole range of support staff workers, all of whom expressed their utter dismay at the decision to effectively outsource this program to a private for-profit company.
               </p>
               <p>
                Originally the contract was awarded to Navitas in Newcastle. I was of the understanding—and this has now been confirmed—that Navitas very quickly batted that contract on to
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAX" rel="nofollow">
                 MAX
                </a>
                Solutions. I ask the question: did Navitas ever intend to deliver this program? I do not know. They have had a record in Newcastle more recently delivering some of the humanitarian settlement services. I understand they will be removing themselves from that work as well. So it is very unclear what the original intentions were. But it does seem to me that we have a situation where we have a very fine public education institution delivering an outstanding program with tremendous on-site facilities. Like the member for Cunningham said, many of the students in my area have sorted their accommodation arrangements to live close by the facilities or close to public transport. Young mothers participating in this program are very often dropping kids off at Islington Public School, right near the TAFE, and taking their other young children to the on-site creche facility that is available at Hunter TAFE before then going up to their classes which start at nine o'clock. One of the reasons why an on-site creche facility was established at Hunter TAFE was the difficulty women were having in accessing childcare services close by or en route to their classes. It has resulted in enabling so many of those young women to participate and get their 510 hours of tremendous tuition that they require.

                Absolutely no-one disputes the importance of being proficient in the English language in order to assist with settlement in Australia. That goes without saying. But it is of great concern to me that we have a situation where we are taking from the public education sector, which has a tremendous track record, and handing it on not just to one but now subletting on to a second private for-profit organisation. I have no doubt that it is those smaller programs in regional communities that are going to suffer. Many of the outreach programs that TAFE has been offering will not be profitable for a for-profit organisation to take on. The men and women in those programs will suffer dearly, and it is a great shame. I ask the government to rethink their strategy and to reverse this decision—
