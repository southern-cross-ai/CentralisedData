        Most members of parliament travel to and from Canberra by plane, and a few of us are lucky enough to drive. Last week I decided to make the journey by train, which is operated by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        TrainLink. The trip from Kingston station here in Canberra takes around 3.5 hours to Campbelltown and another four hours and 10 minutes to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Central_Station" rel="nofollow">

        with stops on the way at Queanbeyan, Bungendore, Tarago, Goulburn, Bundanoon,

        and Mittagong. Although it took about an hour longer than driving, travelling by train is a much more interesting scenic route and gives you a different look at the countryside. The cost of a one-way ticket was $40.67, and for the princely extra sum of $16.60 I could have upgraded to first class. The seats in economy were comfortable, more comfortable than an aircraft or a bus, and the train has the additional advantage that you're able to get up and walk around. On board the train, there's a cafeteria where you could buy a coffee, albeit instant, lunch and drinks, including wine or beer. The NSW TrainLine staff were professional and courteous, and I congratulate them on their efforts. Although I wouldn't swap it for driving to Canberra, it's definitely an option to try even though the train runs on diesel fuel.
