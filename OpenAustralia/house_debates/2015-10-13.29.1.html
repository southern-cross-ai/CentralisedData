        As you know full well, Mr Deputy Speaker Broadbent, the federal government is investing in rural road infrastructure to keep our communities safe and our businesses moving. As part of the record $50 billion investment in infrastructure, residents in Wannon are beginning to see the benefits of over $500 million of road funding to local roads and highways. This local funding from the federal government is a collection of a number of projects, including Roads to Recovery, the

        , the Bridges Renewal Program and major road upgrades. The major road in Wannon that is a federal government responsibility, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        , is receiving $404 million for its duplication between Ballarat and Stawell. In the case of specific needs, the coalition is also responding to community concerns. Work is beginning on the Condah-Hotspur Road, which is receiving a $2.5 million upgrade to widen, strengthen and seal the over 14 kilometres north of Heywood. This will help with the demand placed on the road from heavy vehicles, making it safer for trucks, school buses, tourists and the community.

        Sadly, however, this commitment is not being supported by the state Labor government, which has cut $160 million from the Country Roads and Bridges Program in its first budget. This money should be returned immediately. The state Labor Premier should also explain why he is taking road funding out of rural communities to spend on his own electorate. It is an absolute disgraceâ€”
