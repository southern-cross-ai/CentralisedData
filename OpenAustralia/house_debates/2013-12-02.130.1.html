       <p>
        I rise to speak on the importance of mobile phone communications in my seat of Corangamite. Mobile phone black spots have placed an enormous amount of pressure on local communities, including Birregurra, Gellibrand, Dereel, Rokewood and many other communities throughout the Otways. A reliable mobile phone service is so important, particularly in fire-prone and remote areas. Expanding mobile phone coverage has an obvious benefit to public safety, especially during summer, as well as benefits to small business and the wider economy generally.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why I am extremely proud of the coalition government's $100 million commitment to fixing mobile phone black spots, which reflects genuine care for country people. It is extraordinary that over six years Labor did not invest one cent in mobile communications. These communities are crying out for action and we are delivering that action.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, some communities need action right now. That is why I have called on Telstra to fix these black spots, particularly those in areas in my electorate facing high fire danger. Telstra has the ability to use portable mobile phone base stations to temporarily fix these black spots. The towers can be towed on a trailer and set up quickly. Last week, I joined a community protest in Birregurra calling on Telstra to keep a temporary mobile phone base station that had been brought in for the Great Victorian Bike Ride. It was an insult to many local people, who could see Telstra looking after visiting cyclists but not looking after their community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The township of Dereel is also a prime example of why Telstra should not delay. Dereel is a local community in the northern part of my electorate surrounded by bush. In March this year, the town was devastated by bushfire and 16 homes were lost. Dereel is a notorious mobile phone black spot and with telephone lines down during the bushfire there was no way of calling for help. It is important that we do whatever we can to improve the situation to make sure that these communities never end up in this situation again.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the incredible community push in my electorate, led by the likes of Ruth Uren and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Darren Hill
        </a>
        in Dereel, Amanda Campbell in Birregurra and Corrie Quorne, Neil Longmore and Maria Cosack in Gellibrand. These community champions are just a handful of the many people in my electorate crying out for instant action by Telstra, particularly in the lead-up to the very dangerous bushfire season. It is time that Telstra heeded their calls.
