        I read today that finally New South Wales Health looks set to scrap its useless, redundant and discriminatory COVID mandates, but we're still waiting for Victoria to drop its 'three jabs or no work' policy. I still receive heartbreaking calls from doctors, nurses, firies, police officers and paramedics who were terminated from their jobs, many of them charged with serious misconduct and had it put on their records, for not submitting to the experimental COVID jab. Mind you, even in the midst of their distress and suffering at the injustice perpetrated against them, not one of them regrets not taking the experimental

        Let me be clear: for those with eyes to see and ears to hear, there's no shortage of peer-reviewed scientific evidence. It's just not being reported in the mainstream news. I know doctors are hearing reports of adverse injuries in their patients but are too afraid to speak up for fear of retribution from AHPRA. What happened to a doctor's oath of 'first do no harm'? I say to doctors across Australia—in fact, I plead with you: it's not too late to stand up and share your concerns on behalf of your patients, on behalf of your community.
