       <p>
        A few months ago I stood in this House to call the Queensland state government to action on several infrastructure programs that were being held up. There are two that come to mind. One is the $20 million John Peterson Bridge on the Mundubbera-Durong Road, a big project that has been wanted for many, many years. It was costed by the main roads department at $20 million in scope, and that was about 18 months ago. The costs have now blown out, thanks to the delays in the construction of this bridge, to $25 million, so it has jumped $5 million in 18 months. The other project is the $40 million Springsure-Tambo Road, yet to be started. This was announced over 12 months ago, and it's been given priority by this government, but, of course, we work on the 80-20 break-up of costs, with 80 per cent coming from this federal government and 20 per cent from the state government.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I want to call the Queensland government to action. They are doing some announcements this week, but they are re-announcing what we've already announced. We know there's an election coming up, but I'd like the Queensland government to come forward with these projects. Remember, it's all about jobs, especially post COVID-19.
