        It was my pleasure more recently to attend the

        I make special mention of the Scenic Rim and Lockyer Valley citizens of the year—Kim Crow and Adrian Shepley—for their contribution to their respective communities. Kim was recognised for her generosity and calm nature, for sharing her contagious enthusiasm with the community and for being a willing worker and leader. Kim was the first female first officer of the Beechmont Rural Fire Brigade and has been involved in numerous community groups in the district. Adrian is credited for his passion and his commitment to the local community through his contributions to various sporting clubs and the Laidley

       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to place on record my empathetic support for maintaining Australia Day celebrations on 26 January. There may be other ways in which we can recognise and acknowledge the impact of white settlement on
