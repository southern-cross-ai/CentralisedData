        . His work was as a farmer. The first thing that happened in the days before he began was that he would go from horses to a tractor, and then he'd milk the cows. He'd milk in the morning, work for Ron Townley's transport company all day, go home and milk at night and then go out to community functions each night. He built his own home from scratch.
