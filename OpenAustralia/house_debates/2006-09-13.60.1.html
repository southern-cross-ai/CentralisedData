        My question is to the trade minister and refers to a record of conversation between his department and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        executives. The government tells the AWB ‘to stay in touch with Minister Vaile’s office for advice on the government’s public lines’—that is, on the impending release of the Volcker inquiry report. Why was the minister still colluding with AWB on the eve of the release of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Volcker report when, by then, the government had received a June 2003 cable from Baghdad stating that every oil for food contract had a 10 per cent kickback, a September 2003
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        defence report stating that AWB contracts had been upped by 11 per cent, an October 2003 report by Australian Treasury officials virtually to the same effect and a May 2004 briefing from an ADF officer in Iraq who said that the jig was up on the AWB and that the AWB was up to its eyeballs in corruption?

           Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Aside from the question of length—which the practice of the House says is not in order—the member opposite said that the minister had been colluding. This is a serious allegation and can be dealt with only by substantive motion, and not at question time. I ask the member to withdraw those words.

            On the same point of order, Mr Speaker, I cannot see where length is referred to in the standing orders. Certainly it is in

            .
