        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that under his proposals the number of media owners could fall from six to four in regional markets such as Albury-Wodonga, Ballarat, Bundaberg, Dubbo, Gladstone, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Mackay, Maryborough, Mildura, Nambour, Newcastle, Orange, Rockhampton, Shepparton, Toowoomba, Townsville and Warwick? Why won’t the Prime Minister listen to the member for Hinkler, whom he trusts to chair his backbench communication committee and who opposes the Prime Minister’s plan, and admit that such a massive concentration of media ownership is not in the national interest?

         I listen very intently to the member for Hinkler. He is a very valued colleague and friend. What is more, the people of Hinkler listen to the member for Hinkler. Despite the worst perfidious attempts of the

         The media laws recognise the way in which the media landscape in this country has changed since they were introduced in 1987. The House ought to be reminded that the media changes that were introduced in 1987 were not designed to promote good public policy; they were designed to cripple two media companies that did not enjoy the patronage of the Australian Labor Party—namely, the old

         group and, at that time, the Fairfax group. I hear all of this malarky lately about how there was some inspired motive in 1987, but it was all cheap politics in 1987 and now we are getting a bit of proper examination with the aim of getting decent public policy. We have introduced the legislation and the Senate committee will have a look at it. I will be very happy to look at reasonable suggestions made by colleagues but I certainly will not be taking too much advice from current or former leaders of the Australian Labor Party.
