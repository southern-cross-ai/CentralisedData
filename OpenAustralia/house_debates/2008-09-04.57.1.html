         Of course the government are committed to an education revolution and we are doing that because we want every child in this country to have a world-class education. I know the members of the opposition are in a sour mood today, because last night they had their big shindig—listening to

         while having glasses of red wine—and this morning they have woken up a little sore in the head and with a sour taste in their mouths, but if they could just try and concentrate for one moment. While they are living in the past, we are committed to making sure that the children of this country get a first-class education in the future. We are committed to overcoming the neglect of more than a decade of the former government—six years of it under the personal administration of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. For a reason best known to themselves, they are all pretending to be characters from

         today. They picked the wrong show; it should have been
         <i>
          Seinfeld
         </i>
         a show about nothing! They all would have fitted into that because they did nothing in government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me tell you, Mr Speaker: the Howard government released 24 reports on teaching and 76 on school education and it did nothing of substance to make a difference to the quality of education in Australian schools. The Rudd Labor government are getting on with the job of investing in Australian education—our $1.2 billion digital education revolution, our $2.5 billion investment in trades training centres in schools, our $577 million investment in literacy and numeracy, our $534 million investment in early childhood education and our $500 million we have already delivered to Australian universities to help them renew their ageing capital stock because they were bearing the burden of a decade of neglect, six years of it under the personal watch of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         But we want to do more and, in doing more, we have created the Education Investment Fund, an $11 billion fund to renew the capital stock of our universities and our vocational education and training sector. I am asked about the risks to this new fund. The risk to this new fund is the smash-and-grab raid that the Liberal Party has engaged in on the surplus. In pursuit of luxury cars, they are putting at risk our ability to invest in our educational institutions, particularly vocational and higher education institutions.

           I hear the member for O’Connor yelling out, and I can inform the member for O’Connor that this fund, in operation, would be able to benefit the

                   Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am pleased to see that, in opposition, the member for Warringah has finally found a copy of the standing orders—something he neglected for all those years in government. He never had one before, so something has improved in his life during the last few months. We want to see investments in universities—

                    Mr Speaker, on a point of order:
                    <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=3" title="An answer must be relevant to the question.    From...">
                     standing order 104
                    </a>
                    does apply to questions—that they should be relevant. The question of whether the member for Warringah has a set of standing orders is hardly relevant to the answer of this question.

                      Thank you very much. Now they are calling each other irrelevant. That is amazing. We want to invest in universities and vocational education and training around this country. The risk to that is the Liberal Party’s smash-and-grab raid on the surplus. I say to the Liberal Party: if they are going to continue on this smash-and-grab raid, they should have the decency to ring every vice chancellor and every
