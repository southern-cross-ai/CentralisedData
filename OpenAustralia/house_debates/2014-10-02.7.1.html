        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill reintroduces several measures previously introduced in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 and the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 2) Bill 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first reintroduced measure will implement some changes to Australian government payments. Firstly, from 1 July 2015, indexation of the income-free areas for all working-age allowances (other than student payments), and the income test-free area for parenting payment single, will be paused for three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        From royal assent, parenting payment single will be indexed to the consumer price index only, by removing benchmarking to male total average weekly earnings.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1 July 2015, indexation of several family tax benefit-free areas will be paused for three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, from 1 January 2015, indexation of the income-free areas and other means-test thresholds for student payments, including the student income bank limits, will be paused for three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will introduce four family payment reforms from 1 July 2015. The first is to maintain the standard
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTB" rel="nofollow">
         FTB
        </a>
        child rates for two years in the maximum and base rate of family tax benefit part A and the maximum rate of family tax benefit part B.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second measure will revise the family tax benefit end-of-year supplements to their original values and cease indexation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Family tax benefit part B will be limited to families with children under six years of age, with transitional arrangements applying to current recipients with children above the new age limit for two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        A new allowance will be introduced for single parents on the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A for each child aged six to 12 years inclusive, and not receiving family tax benefit part B.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will extend and simplify the ordinary waiting period for all working-age payments from 1 January 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both the pensioner education supplement and the education entry payment will be ceased from 1 January 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1 January 2015, the bill will extend youth allowance (other) to 22- to 24-year-olds in lieu of Newstart allowance and sickness allowance. Young people with full capacity will be required to learn, earn or Work for the Dole from 1 January 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, from 1 January 2015, the bill will remove the three months' backdating of disability pensions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill forms part of a package of bills to support the sustainability of the social security system and the nation's budget. I commend this bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
