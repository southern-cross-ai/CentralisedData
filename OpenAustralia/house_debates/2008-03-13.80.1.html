       <p>
        Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. We in this place all know that the strength of our local communities is very much dependent on the tireless volunteers and the community leaders who deliver so much on the ground. Government plays a critical role in terms of programs and funding but, without the volunteers and community leaders who are there to drive the projects and inspire their communities, a lot less would be done in our communities. We all know that the strength of our local communities depends on their great work. I wanted to take the time today to mention some of those community leaders and volunteers and some of the projects that have come about because of their hard work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to mention three projects dealing with crime prevention and security cameras. These projects have come about because of great community work and great community leadership, resulting in federal government funding. I mention firstly the security cameras that were obtained by the Croydon Main Street Traders Association.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monika_Meyer" rel="nofollow">
         Monika Meyer
        </a>
        and Senior Constable Julie Simpson worked tirelessly with the traders to secure funding for those cameras. They put in some funding of their own, secured some council funding as well, and the result has seen a massive improvement in crime reduction in the Main Street Croydon area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, grants for security cameras were successful for the Mooroolbark traders. I pay tribute to Geoff Peirce; Sergeant Richard Higgins; the Mount Evelyn Township Improvement Committee, led by Jan Simmons from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_House" rel="nofollow">
         Morrison House
        </a>
        ; and Sergeant Lisa Brooks, who was also successful in gaining funding. Those cameras will be installed in the not-too-distant future. Without the work of the volunteers, those applications would not have been successful. Those projects will have a very real and tangible impact on their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to pay tribute to the Montrose Recreation Reserve Redevelopment Committee, who have worked very hard in the Montrose area to obtain funding over a number of years for the redevelopment of the Montrose precinct. I particularly pay tribute to Ken Dowling and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_McDonald" rel="nofollow">
         Julie McDonald
        </a>
        . Both were instrumental in collating the information necessary for the successful application for fundingâ€”funding that was matched by the

        </a>
        and also the state government.
