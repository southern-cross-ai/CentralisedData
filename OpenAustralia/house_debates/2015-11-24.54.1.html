        My question is to the Prime Minister. Western Sydney is Australia's third-largest economy. As one of our nation's fastest growing regions, over the next decade a million more people will call our region home. As it stands, two-thirds of our Lindsay workforce must commute every day for their employment. Can the Prime Minister please explain how the government's agenda in innovation, infrastructure and cities will create smart jobs for our children in Western Sydney?

           We returned there last month with the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, the Assistant Minister for Science, the Assistant Minister for Innovation and representatives from some of Australia's leading tech start-ups and universities. We had a very, very constructive working session, with the member for Lindsay talking about the content of the government's innovation statement, which will be released shortly.
          </p>
          <p>
           Over the next 20 years, that precinct, which is dedicated to innovation—and we met some amazing start-ups there, some really outstanding, innovative companies that are working in the collaborative spaces there to create jobs, energy and investment in Western Sydney—will have the capacity to generate 6,000 jobs. I also note the Sydney Science Park, which is also in the honourable member's electorate. That was recently opened. That will have the capacity to create 12,200 jobs, educate 10,000 students and provide a place to live for those 10,000 students as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           In terms of infrastructure, we are the first government in generations to push ahead and start planning the design for a second airport in Western Sydney. That is a foundation stone for the wider planning and strategy needed for Western Sydney to continue its growth as an international hub. It is vital that there be more investment and more jobs in Western Sydney.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sydney, the city where I live, which I love, has one big defect: its central business district is nowhere near the centre; it is actually out on the eastern edge of the city. So we need to see strong economic growth, jobs and industry right through the city, including centres like Parramatta, Penrith and Campbelltown, because otherwise the city becomes utterly unbalanced. If the airport is going to be a significant part of that infrastructure development in Western Sydney—

           The honourable member opposite says, 'Rubbish'. It is hard to believe that the Labor Party imagines that they can represent Western Sydney when they write off the airport as rubbish. They have checked out on Western Sydney.
