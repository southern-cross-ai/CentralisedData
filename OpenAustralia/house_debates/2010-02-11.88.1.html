       <p>
        My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I refer the minister to his confirmation on Tuesday that mandatory training standards for all insulation installers will commence from this Friday, 12 February 2010. Can the minister confirm that the ElectroComms and Energy Utilities Industry Skills Council wrote to his department in March 2009—which was not mentioned in today’s statement—to raise concerns about the lack of electrical training for insulation installers? Given these legitimate and credible concerns subsequently borne out by the tragic loss of four young Australians, why did it take almost a full year for this action to occur?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question and I refer him to the statement that I made in the House earlier today. I amplify that statement by pointing out the process that I went through in order to determine the appropriate level of training for the installation of insulation. Up until such time as this program began to be rolled out through Australia and installers started installing insulation, there was no nationally accredited training module at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have introduced that but I have done it in the proper way. I have done it with full consultation with the relevant state bodies and the training organisations, and I have brought forward a module for training on the basis of the advice that I have received from my department that it meets the goals that the government has for risks and the appropriate level of training. I have always said about this program that insulating over a million homes is a significant exercise by any measure—and that is what this government has done—and that if there additional issues that required addressing over time then I would address them. Regarding the nationally accredited training model that was brought forward for the first time by this government, significant additional advice to me showed that the potential for an additional level of training ought to be contemplated by me. I took that advice and I brought it to bear.
        </p>
        <p>
         I conclude on one other matter in reference to the question previously asked of me by the honourable member. I am pleased to note the media release from

         today welcoming the safety inspections and the ‘announcement by Minister Garrett to immediately conduct’ those inspections:

        <p class="italic">
         It is pleasing that Minister Garrett has now acted on our advice and households will be able to engage a licensed electrician to conduct a safety inspection, and, where required, rectify any identified faults.
