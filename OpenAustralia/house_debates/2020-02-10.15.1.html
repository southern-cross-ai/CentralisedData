        My question is to the Minister for Health—noting his outstanding leadership. Will the minister update the House on the actions the Morrison government is taking to protect the health of Australians against the coronavirus?

         I thank the member for Goldstein, who has been an outstanding advocate for public health on many different fronts over the years. As we know, the coronavirus continues to grow in its spread, particularly within China. The latest figure that I have of confirmed cases, which I received just before coming into question time, is 40,546 cases. This is a significant update on where that figure was only a few days ago, last Thursday. Sadly, 910 people have now been confirmed as having lost their lives to coronavirus. This death rate is very significant. Each is a human life that has been tragically lost, and collectively it represents a very significant figure as compared with the rate with regard to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS" rel="nofollow">
          SARS
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of Australia, as the Prime Minister said, 15 patients have been confirmed here and five have now cleared the virus, which is very, very good news. We also know, from advice on the weekend—and I spoke with the director of AUSMAT on island only yesterday—that a young girl who was tested for coronavirus has been declared as being virus free and negative; so had not contracted the virus.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, we've had a second airlift, which, as the Prime Minister mentioned, arrived in Darwin yesterday. We've had tremendous support from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         government. I want to thank the community, in particular, but also Minister Fyles and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Minister
         </a>
         . I have spoken to members of this House, including the member for Solomon and the member for Lingiari, over the weekend, as well as Senator Sam McMahon and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy—all of whom have been very, very strong in their support.
        </p>
        <p>
         The message from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Medical Officer
         </a>
         regarding the 266 passengers who have arrived on this humanitarian airlift is that they have been tested, not just once or twice but on five occasions, and all have been found to be symptom free and virus free so far. They are in quarantine because, during the incubation period, it cannot be guaranteed that it won't develop. But, at this stage, the signs are exceptionally good, and the protections for the community outside are exceptionally good.
        </p>
        <p>
         This facility was stood up within 24 hours. Along with the Chief Medical Officer, I had the privilege of meeting Border Force, Defence and AUSMAT personnel at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         base where the passengers were being received and AUSMAT personnel on site at the national trauma centre and then to see the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Howard Springs
         </a>
         temporary quarantine facility itself. All of the passengers are travelling well. It's a testimony to the bipartisanship being shown and it's a testimony to the cooperation amongst all parts of the Australian system that we've been able to airlift, take care of and treat patients and to take care of people around the country.
