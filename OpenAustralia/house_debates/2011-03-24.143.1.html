        I would like to raise again an issue raised by the member for Murray some time ago, which is the outbreak of blackwater events through the Murray-Darling Basin, particularly the southern sections of it, which has been occurring since September as a result of the phenomenal meteorological events that have occurred throughout the southern parts of the continent. The first of these blackwater outbreaks occurred on the Wakool River back in September and through October, with alarming impacts on the mortality of fish, particularly Murray cod. It was very sad to see half-metre-long Murray cod floating belly up along the Wakool River in that period. A Murray cod of that length is at least 40 years of age, perhaps even 50. We have worked extremely hard over the years to ensure the longevity of these fish. It is just a tragedy to see them floating dead down our river system.
       </p>

        Then, just before Christmas, with the second of the huge meteorological events, came the blackwater outbreak that flowed out of the Barmah Forest and saw the

        impacted. It was phenomenal to see crustaceans, Murray cray, going up the banks of the

        to survive—quite a tourist attraction it was. They were escaping the lack of oxygen because of blackwater in the Murray River. It was quite interesting to see so many Murray River cray. We were told they had gone extinct, yet they were there unseen and were forced out of the water because of this plume of blackwater.

        There has been much to learn as a result of the breaking of this drought—such a long period of drought; low rainfall for almost 15 years—including how to deal with the floods and everything else that has emanated from the unbelievably strong meteorological outcomes that have occurred through the Murray-Darling Basin. It is quite fascinating to me, as the member for the arid Mallee, to declare that in Mildura last Saturday night there was another 3½ inches of rain in one rainfall event over about four hours. It is confirmation that precipitation outcomes are changing in the Murray valley.
       </p>
       <p>
        Blackwater events occur as a result of accumulation of organic matter. We have got to find much better and cleverer ways to use the environmental water that is being purchased to create larger, more natural flood events to ensure this phenomenon does not happen again.
