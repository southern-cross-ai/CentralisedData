        [by video link] My question is for the Minister for the Environment. Will the minister update the House on the Morrison government's commitment to a lasting and peaceful presence in Antarctica and maintaining Tasmania's place as the world's gateway to Antarctica, ensuring local jobs and investments for my home state of Tasmania?

         I thank the member for Bass for her question and I commend her on all of the extraordinary work she does for her constituents. She called me the other day from a windswept

          Flinders Island
         </a>
         , asking me to sort something out for her, and of course I shall. Thank you, Member for Bass, for being part of Tasmania's recognition of the importance of our Antarctic Division.

         Australia is a proud Antarctic nation, and the icy continent has featured prominently in our national story and our national interests, dating back to the early expeditions of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Douglas_Mawson" rel="nofollow">
          Sir Douglas Mawson
         </a>
         . Australia was an original signatory to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
          Antarctic Treaty
         </a>
         , signed by the Menzies government 60 years ago. The treaty established the Antarctic as a non-militarised region, with multinational efforts for peace and collaborative scientific endeavour. Today, I would add that it is also for the protection of the environment in the world's last untouched wilderness. A modern Australian Antarctic Program that supports the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System" rel="nofollow">
          Antarctic Treaty System

         is critical for Australia to continue delivering world-class science and run safe and efficient operations.

         Over the weekend, Hobart saw the arrival of our new $1.9 billion icebreaker,

          Nuyina
         </i>
         . The 160-metre-long vessel is the most advanced research platform of its kind in the word. It's capable of breaking through 1.65 metres of sea ice. It can deal with 14-metre seas, hurricane winds and temperatures of minus 30 degrees. It is the world's quietest icebreaker for scientific research, with minimal disturbance to the ecosystems below. It's a truly incredible ship, carrying up to four helicopters—in fact, the helideck is the size of seven cricket pitches—117 personnel and 32 crew for 92 days at sea. It has three permanent scientific laboratories and a moon pool for direct access to the ocean through the hull. This is fantastic for the partnerships we have with other nations, who can collaborate with their researchers and expeditioners on board the ship.

         provides an ongoing reminder of the Morrison government's commitment to Tasmania as an international Antarctic science hub, and it arrived just days after the 40th anniversary of the Australian Antarctic Division's move to Hobart in 1981. It sends a clear signal to Tasmanians that the Morrison government is focused on local investment, on creating jobs and on growing Antarctic industries so that Hobart can be the world's greatest Antarctic gateway. We remain committed to scientific research, protecting the environment, and ensuring the continent is used only for peaceful purposes, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with other nations as we deliver a new era of Antarctic endeavour, with Australia, particularly Tasmania, leading the world.
