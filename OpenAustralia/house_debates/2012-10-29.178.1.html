           <p>
            I rise today to speak on this motion that I have introduced to the parliament. The timing of this motion is also to acknowledge the importance of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
             Remembrance Day
            </a>
            which is less than two weeks away. I believe that Remembrance Day is one of the days of true national significance in this country and I know that the towns in my electorate take Remembrance Day very seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            The commemoration of the armistice at the end of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
             World War I
            </a>
            , ending that horrible conflict, and subsequently the memory of other conflicts that have followed, is very important to the Australian people.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also important to remember that, as we stand here today, we still have Australian soldiers in overseas conflicts putting their lives at risk. It is important at times like this and on Remembrance Day that we acknowledge those who are still in harm's way. I would like to mention Nathaniel Gallagher, who was tragically killed in Afghanistan a couple of months ago and was laid to rest at Pilliga in the north-west of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            . Attending Nathaniel Gallagher's funeral certainly brought home to me the danger and the impact that our soldiers who are serving overseas have on our community.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is important to bring forward this motion not only to mark the importance of Remembrance Day, which will be commemorated in coming weeks, but also to acknowledge that there has been, in the past, a shortfall in the recognition of Indigenous people who have contributed to Defence services. This is particularly important to the Parkes electorate, which I believe has the second-largest Aboriginal population, second only to Lingiari in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Territory
            </a>
            . Indeed, I represent more than 20,000 Aboriginal people in this parliament.
           </p>
           <p>
            This motion is an opportunity for the chamber to acknowledge the contributions of Indigenous service men and women. It is important to note that there is significant work being done to appropriately acknowledge the efforts of Indigenous service men and women. During Reconciliation Week in May 2012, services were held in major cities across Australia to acknowledge their efforts. Services for contributions in Defence forces were also held in Canberra this year, as part of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC" rel="nofollow">
             NAIDOC
            </a>
            Week celebrations. The federal government has also been doing work in this area, such as the creation of the National Indigenous Veterans' Liaison Officer in 2006 under the previous coalition government, and subsequently their state-based counterparts.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe it is very positive that the Defence forces are actively recruiting in Indigenous communities at the moment. Many opportunities are available and these opportunities will make a difference, should members of these communities take them up. What has changed, as the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Defence Force
            </a>
            actively recruits in Indigenous communities, is that during the two world wars and other conflicts there was an official restriction that prevented Aboriginal people from entering the armed forces. Many were still able to enlist, although due to limited information from the time, we now have an incomplete picture of how many Indigenous people have enlisted over the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            The involvement of Indigenous people in the armed forces was, in many ways, an exciting time, as they were treated as equals for the first time. It was indeed unfortunate that, on their return, many people who had been comrades in arms could not celebrate togetherâ€”that hotels had different areas for people of different coloured skin. Indeed, many Aboriginal people who returned from the war were quite devastated to find that not much had changed in the time that they had been away.
           </p>
           <p>
            War is a unifying experience. The friendships formed over the years by Australians at war were strong and did not take into account a person's background or race. The bonds built during conflicts between whites and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
             Indigenous Australians
            </a>
            should be celebrated in our history. Remembrance Day is an especially important time to commemorate these bonds.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to speak about some things relevant to my electorate, and indeed to your electorate as well Mr Deputy Speaker. The only Aboriginal fighter pilot during the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
             Second World War
            </a>
            was
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Waters" rel="nofollow">
             Leonard Waters
            </a>
            , the son of Donald and Grace Waters. In 1924, Leonard Waters was born at Euraba, the mission near Boomi in northern New South Wales, just south of the Queensland border.
           </p>
           <p>
            When
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Waters" rel="nofollow">
             Len Waters
            </a>
            was an 18-year-old shearer working in regional Queensland, he joined the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
             RAAF
            </a>
            as ground staff and commenced his training as a flight mechanic. Within the next year, Leonard had been selected to undergo pilot training in Victoria. He excelled in training and went on to graduate as a fighter pilot. Leonard Waters served his country with distinction and was laid to rest at St George in the Maranoa electorate in 1993. There is a plaque commemorating Len Waters in the park alongside the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newell_Highway" rel="nofollow">
             Newell Highway
            </a>
            in Boggabilla and he is mentioned at the war memorial at Toomelah, which I will speak about in a second. A couple of years ago, I had the privilege of meeting Len's widow, a very feisty and funny lady. She spoke about her courtship with Len Waters, which I think consisted of three dates just after he came home from the war. They were together for over 60 years before Len passed away.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also like to mention that at Toomelah, in the northern part of my electorate, is a memorial dedicated to Aboriginal service men and women who have served in all conflicts. I was very privileged to be part of its unveiling. Incidentally, it was constructed by local people under the CDEP program and in a place that has had some bad publicity of late. The community took a great amount of pride in the project and still doâ€”they still care for that memorial. It is a wonderful effort from that community to commemorate past achievements of Aboriginal people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I would like to mention Councillor Victor Bartley, who is the chairman of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
             RSL
            </a>
            sub-branch at Bourke. Vic approached me some months ago about the state of the war memorial in the township of Bourke. Vic is an Aboriginal chap, but he believes that all the service people in Bourke should be treated the same. Indeed, on that memorial are Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, but he is concerned that, because it is in such a central location, the memorial is starting to show the signs of wear and tear just from a lot of public attention. He believes that an effort should be made to upgrade that memorial. Indeed, the local council has put some money aside and has started work on it. I am hopeful that the federal government will also contribute to the memorial, because it is important. Not only now but in 50, 100 or 200 years time the residents of towns like Bourke will understand what a contribution their forefathers made, particularly their Aboriginal forefathers, who were breaking new ground. They represented their country in conflicts and should be remembered for now and evermore.

             I rise to speak in strong support of the motion put forward by the honourable member for Parkes and commend him on bringing it before the House so that some members get an opportunity to speak to it. It is a commendable motion and one that I know all members would wish to lend their support to. I am happy to agree to the amendments to the motion. When it came to researching the subject, I can say that it was very difficult to get an accurate picture of numbers of service personnel from
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
              World War I

             and World War

              II
             </a>
             or even information on entitlements from the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
              Department of Veterans' Affairs
             </a>
             . There were conflicting numbers, so I can understand that the honourable member for Parkes moved the amendment to try to get the numbers as accurate as possible, given we are dealing with inaccuracies in a framework. I looked at figures from the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
              Australian War Memorial
             </a>
             as well, but they are a work in progress.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thank the Parliamentary Library for the great research that they did for me; I am going to rely on it heavily in my contribution today.
            </p>
            <p>
             This motion is about respect, honour and recognition. This was something that I knew about but, having read and reread some of the research, I can only imagine how soldiers must have felt when they went off to be a soldier with their mates, either in the theatre of war or serving in some capacity, and then, having been in the Defence forces, stepping back into everyday life and suffering the discrimination that they suffered. It would have made even the most generous person feels some degree of bitterness. I know it was difficult for the Aboriginal and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
              Torres Strait
             </a>
             Islander people to get into the Defence forces. If you read the Defence Act you will see there were certain prohibitions there which were relaxed because they wanted people to join, and there were different pay and conditions. They were discriminatory and not based, as far as I could tell from the research, on any legal grounds. I found that the numbers, which the honourable member for Parkes has put in the amended motion, are consistent with the later work that I found.
            </p>
            <p>
             As to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
              First World War
             </a>
             , paragraph 61(1)(h) of the Defence Act 1903 exempted from service in time of war persons who were 'not substantially of European descent'. So that Defence Act frustrated Aboriginal people's attempts to enlist, but those recruitment policies were relaxed after heavy losses in 1916 and 1917.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another thing that happenedâ€”and I remember hearing about this and I remember talking to various people about itâ€”was that after the war there were various parts of Aboriginal reserves, which used to be called missions, that were awarded to returning veterans as soldier settlement blocks, and in the records it shows only one Aboriginal veteran is known to have received a soldier settlement block. It was quite shameful that that happened. Reading it, I thought that that must have been a very difficult situation.

             At the start of

              World War II
             </a>
             , the Defence Act barred the conscription of full-blooded Indigenous people because it held that, since they were not enfranchised citizens, Aboriginal and

              Torres Strait Islander
             </a>
             s should not be compelled to defend Australia. The three services of the ADF had certain regulations which also could prevent persons who were not substantially of European descent from enlisting. However, despite this, some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men managed to enlist because they wanted to serve their country. The same thing that happened in World War I happened in World War IIâ€”there was a fair amount of discretion on the part of those dealing with enlistment and there was relaxation of rules, with the medical staff relaxing them, and that allowed a lot of people to get in. I will read something from the secretary of the Prime Minister's Department. It says, 'regarding the non-acceptance of full-blooded aborigines, I am to state that when this instruction was issued it was decided that no action was to be taken to discharge full-blooded aborigines who had already been accepted'. It goes on like that, and there were other such letters and instructions.

              Indigenous Australians

             enlisted. That was in August 1943.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would say there that nearly every able-bodied Torres Strait Islander male had enlisted by 1944, but they did not receive the same rates of pay or conditions as white soldiers; there was a lot of research done on that. It was the same with the formation of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
              Northern Territory
             </a>
             Special Reconnaissance Unit that was created: the research that was done, particularly through the Parliamentary Library, shows that there were 51 Indigenous people who were in that unit, and they were paid three sticks of tobacco per week and only supplied with Army rations when on training. When on patrol, they were expected to find their own food. The unit existed for about 16 months before being disbanded. Similar units were formed on Melville and Bathurst islands and on the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
              Cox Peninsula
             </a>
             , and they were used in much the same way as the Northern Territory Special Reconnaissance Unit. There was the same sort of pay and conditions, and I was told that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melville_Island" rel="nofollow">
              Melville Island
             </a>
             men were given very small act of grace payments during the 1960s. I remember that, from 1983, the Hawke government made the decision to pay veterans of these units compensation and proper disability pensions for their service, so there are certain actions that have been taken since. If you read the history of that, you can see that that has been done over a period of years. It was in 1991 that the Australian government awarded back pay and service medals to surviving members and families of particular units from Melville and Bathurst island, the Cox Peninsula et cetera, and I was pleased to see that happen. After the end of the war the services reinstated the ban on enlistment, but by 1949 the Army had changed that practice.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was looking at how many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from my area were enlisted, and so far we have come up with eight from the Lismore, Casino, Kyogle, Grafton and Armidale area. Most of them enlisted in the Lismore area. I am just doing a little bit more research on that. I know some of the families I am reading about in here. I will not mention the names, because I have not had the opportunity to speak with the families yet, but it was really nice to see some of the names there and I realise who some of the families are. I know some of the families and know how proud they are of those men who were serving in the world warâ€”and, of course, some of them never returned; they paid the ultimate sacrifice.

              Understandably, there is no more important an occasion than Anzac Day in Wagga Wagga. Air men and women, sailors and soldiers, watched by large numbers of grateful and solemn citizens, march in perfect step along Baylis Street to the cenotaph in the aptly named

              , where wreaths are laid and speeches made. It is always a grand yet sombre ceremony. For we remember, as do all Australians on 25 April, the enormous price paid so that we may live free. We are mindful of the ongoing sacrifice being made by our troops in Afghanistan, where we have lost 39 of our best and bravest since 2002, as well as other peacekeeping deployments abroad.

              'Aboriginal people were and are proud to wear the Australian military uniform,' Hewitt told me just yesterday.

              onwards. Often Aborigines' and Islanders' presence has been an invisible one. The services generally have not identified soldiers by race on enlistment records, and in general the Memorial has not noted a person's race in the photo captions in its collection.

              . Since then, other researchers have added to our knowledge, and today the contribution of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to Australia's defence is at last becoming fully recognised.

              That was said by Len Watson in 1974. The introduction continues:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Generally Aborigines have served alongside other races in ordinary units. Conditions of service have been the same as those for Europeans. This has helped to foster understanding and respect between the races.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              In the short term, however, little was changed. Aborigines who had experienced equal treatment for the first time in their lives in the armed services came back to find that civilian society treated them with the same prejudice and discrimination as before.

              Hewitt Whyman is the descendant of the Firebrace boys from Moulamein: proud Aborigines, dedicated soldiers, men who loved the Australian bush and who were proud to call the Riverina home. The blood ties are through Hewitt's mother, Lena Jackson.

              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lyons" rel="nofollow">
               Tom Lyons
              </a>
              of Narrandera. 'Tommy was a Rat of Tobruk but had been insubordinate to an officer, so he was not awarded his medals upon his return,' Hewitt recalled. 'When others who fought with him were allocated parcels of land to start a farm, Tommy missed out. He had to rely on his mates coming out the back of the RSL to have a drink. But eventually he was handed his medals after his son Cecil and I did some work to put things right. Tommy was presented with them by the Commandant of Kapooka at a special service, and it was such a proud moment.'

             <p>
              War memorials dotted throughout the Australian countryside, in just about every village and town and sometimes on isolated rural roads to mark the contribution made by a particular district, are a fitting reminder of service given, lives lost. Some are mere stone markers, monuments in time simply recording battles fought, campaigns won. There are those which list the names of locals who made the ultimate sacrifice, who did not come home. Others list all local names: those who served and returned; those who lie in foreign soil, including Flanders field, where, as Canadian Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae observed:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              â€¦ the poppies blow

             </p>
             <p>
              Sometimes the names are not always in alphabetical order, perhaps because someone with some sort of link to an area was overlooked when names were being collated for the stonemason, or, as someone once told me when he saw me taking a photograph of the memorial at Nimbin, because they were added later. Their Aboriginality, he claimed, precluded them from originally being placed on the memorial. I put that remark to Hewitt Wyman, who said he had heard the same thing. Thankfully past wrongs are being made right and I commend the member for Parkes, who has one of the largest populations of Indigenous peopleâ€”second only to Lingiari of the 150 electorates in Australiaâ€”in his electorate, for putting forward this motion. It will, alongside other research and recognition work, help to appropriately recognise the marvellous contribution Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have made to our nation's military and therefore to our freedom.

Len never flew again, returning to shearing to make a living. He died at Cunnamulla in Queensland, but his war service was commemorated with the issue of a stamp and an aerogram in Australia Post's 1995 series Australia Remembers. We remember Len Waters; we remember all of the Aborigines who have served our country so well.

               It is with deep shame that we recognise that there were marked differences in pay and benefits awarded to Indigenous servicemen and women. It is to our collective indignity that it wasn't until 40 years after the war that this discrimination was rectified. But Australians have learnt a lot since then and we have grown up as a nation and now respect our Indigenous peoples. And this is reflected in the way Indigenous servicemen and women now operate and serve our country. In particular, I mention the operations of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NORFORCE" rel="nofollow">
                NORFORCE
               </a>
               , which well reflect this.

               NORFORCE, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_Mobile_Force" rel="nofollow">
                North West Mobile Force
               </a>
               , was established in the early 1980s. NORFORCE was raised to address our need for surveillance and reconnaissance in Australia's north and north-west. For many reasons NORFORCE is a distinctive part of our defence network. For a start, it is responsible for the largest area of operations in the entire world. Its role in surveillance is critical in maintaining our security but also in responding to issues in these remote parts of the country.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not surprisingly, NORFORCE is reliant on its Aboriginal soldiers, whose understanding and awareness of the environment is pivotal to its success. NORFORCE has a very high number of Indigenous soldiersâ€”about 500, or 60 per cent of the total contingentâ€”and it is very much supported by local communities. Many of the soldiers are from local Aboriginal communities and being part of NORFORCE is a source of both employment and great pride. Their role as protectors of their land is esteemed and honoured. A few years ago, the Indigenous television program
               <i>
                Message Stick
               </i>
               showcased the importance of NORFORCE to Aboriginal people and their communities. NORFORCE has its genesis 70 years ago with the 'Nackeroos'. Back then Aborigines and whites worked together to patrol our northern borders against the threat from the Japanese. Much of this soldiering was carried out on horseback with primitive communications and few resources.
              </p>
              <p>
               Today, many Aboriginal people see NORFORCE as providing opportunities to train, to serve and to help their communities. There are now hundreds of Aboriginal drivers, medics, patrolmen and signallers. This is what one soldier, Danny Rashleigh, told
               <i>

               about his work with NORFORCE:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               With my job that I do with alcohol counselling in communities, I thought it could benefit communities, benefit the young boys, myself, and create a few role models especially with [the] problems â€¦ they have in the community.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I think what Norforce looks for in communities for soldiers is someone who wants to give it a go, self-development, and role modelling in the area.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I recruited a number of men from there last year who I thought showed those qualities, who I thought could excel in those qualities and I thought could also socially develop the community, within themselves, and pass on down to their family plus other young people.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is now recognised that NORFORCE would not be able to function without its Indigenous soldiers. The knowledge and skills they bring, their passion and commitment, their connections to land and community, are invaluable.

              <p>
               I want to talk now about what Defence is doing for the Indigenous community. Defence was actually at the vanguard of reconciliation action plans. It was the first federal government agency to develop a Reconciliation Action Plan. The department did extensive consultation on the development of the plan across all services and also particularly with the Indigenous community in Defence, the Indigenous serving men and women. It is an incredibly comprehensive document and one of the real benefits of it is that it has a number of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPI" rel="nofollow">
                KPI
               </a>
               s to ensure that Defence is constantly trying to improve the recruitment and retention of Indigenous Australians right throughout the country and throughout every service. One of the real benefits of it is the fact that it encourages an acknowledgement of country on bases if there is an event on a base. It also takes a broad view on compassionate leave for funerals and for other ceremonies.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the past some of these could take quite a lengthy amount of time, particularly if you were on a ship. It could be a bit of a challenge getting off the ship to attend the ceremony. So Defence has got a new modelâ€”and it has been around for a number of years nowâ€”to accommodate those family responsibilities that a number of Indigenous members have.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the course of my 10 years working with Defence, I also had the great privilege of working with a number of young Indigenous serving men and women in the Navy, Army and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Air Force
               </a>
               . What really struck me was their commitment to the service and protecting our national interest but also to being role models for the younger members in their communities. Not only do they play a very active role in the service but also when they go home they are very active not just catching up with family members but going out and talking to community organisations, mentoring young kids and building up the self-esteem and confidence of the young kids, hopefully encouraging them to move into the services themselves because they see the many, many benefits that serving in the Army, Navy and Air Force can bring. They have experienced it personally and they want to share it with their communities. They are very impressive young men and woman.
              </p>
              <p>
               In closing, I just want to say that it is a tremendous achievement that NORFORCE is the largest employer of Indigenous people within the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                Northern Territory
               </a>
               and the Kimberley area. I commend the ADF and all those involved, especially our Indigenous service men and women for the outstanding contributions that they have made in the past, that they continue to make and that they will make in the future. I would particularly like to commend and thank the member for Parkes for this motion that celebrates these significant achievements.
