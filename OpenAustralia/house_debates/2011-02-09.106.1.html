        Often, when you read the list of honours on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        you wonder how or why someone gets them. I marvel at times at people who are awarded them, especially when ex-politicians get them for their service to the House. I figured that was what we got a salary for! But in this case a member of my constituency, Norm Gibbs, is an absolute epitome of somebody who should have been recognised in these honours, and I am absolutely delighted that Norm has received the

         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . At a spritely 83 and about to embark upon his 60th wedding anniversary with the magnificent Topsy, Norm is Mr Waverley. He is our community, and I am absolutely delighted that he has been recognised in this way. He is a person where nothing is too small and nothing is too hard. He started off his work within the community many years ago as a Sunday school teacher and a gym instructor at the Hughesdale Community Centre, where his involvement lasted 15 years. When Norm and Topsy married and moved to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Waverley" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Waverley
        </a>
        , he became a charter member of the Waverley
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC" rel="nofollow">
         JC
        </a>
        s. He is one of the oldest and longest serving honorary probation officers and still participates in the probation office in an honorary position. He is the sort of person who will visit somebody in their home and, if they are out of food, drive round the corner and bring it back. Through this work he has ensured that many people have stayed on the straight and narrow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm is heavily involved with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        and was recognised with a Paul Harris Fellowship in 1998 and a companion of the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund for his amazing work within the Rotary system. The motto of ‘service above self’ is the epitome of what Norm is. He started the Zodiac Dance and the Zodiac Youth Group, where he gave countless years.
       </p>
       <p>
        After Cyclone Tracy in Darwin many years ago, Norm saw that there was a need and travelled to Darwin at his own expense. He spent three years working and helping in the rebuild process. This led Norm to think that he needed to do more with his life and so he applied and became a welfare officer within the Waverley City Council. He was one of the very first to adopt that role. Norm has been a tireless worker within the council and still attends many of the council meetings.

        Zodo the Clown was born in 1978 and continues to this day. Every week, Norm, as Zodo, attends the Monash hospital to entertain children. Zodo has entertained everybody from the frail elderly to the disabled. For many years, Norm and his magic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        were seen. Sadly the MG has had to go—it was a sad day when Waverley lost its Zodo MG. Time is catching up with Norm a little, but certainly not in his activities or sprightliness. He is also Santa and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Bunny" rel="nofollow">

        at countless activities for kinders, schools, nursing homes and hospitals.
       </p>
       <p>
        He dedicates a lot of time to supporting those in need. One example was when the Kosovo refugees came to Melbourne and were stationed at Portsea. He thought nobody would be entertaining the kids, so Zodo the Clown spent several days entertaining the Kosovo children at Portsea. Norm is still heavily associated with Very Special Kids, the Down Syndrome Association,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the Rotary Club of Waverley, Child Family Care Network and the Monash Volunteer Association, where Norm has taken on many roles in a volunteering capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm’s dedication and service to the community are simply outstanding. He has assisted me greatly with my work within the community. When I first became the member for Chisholm he had been appointed by the previous member,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wooldridge" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Wooldridge
        </a>
        , to head up a committee. Someone said, ‘You can’t work with Norm; he’ll obviously be a Lib and won’t want to work with you.’ Norm works with anybody. He is one of those individuals who does not have a political flavour. He is dedicated to his community and he served well on that committee. For many years now he has headed up the Caroline Chisholm Award committee that I established. He tirelessly goes through all the nominations and picks out the winners. On the awards night he is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC" rel="nofollow">
         MC
        </a>
        , a role in which he is just fantastic as literally everyone in our community knows him. He is the best MC to have on the day because every recipient knows Norm in some capacity through his work with their many organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Norm has been recognised in the past with a 2006 Victorian Seniors Award. He had the honour of carrying the Olympic torch in 2006. He is a

        volunteer and he co-founded the Zodiac Youth Club. The list goes on and on. He is also a delightful father of two beautiful girls who are now getting older, a grandfather and a justice of the peace. If there were more Norms in the world, it would be a better place.
