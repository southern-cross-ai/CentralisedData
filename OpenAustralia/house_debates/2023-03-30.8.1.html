        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, I present the committee's report entitled

        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”I'm pleased to present the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme's interim report for its inquiry into the capability and culture of the National Disability Insurance Agency. In presenting this report, I acknowledge that many Australians have described the scheme, when it works well, as life-changing. However, in our committee hearings, we've heard the anxiety, frustration and exhaustion of many participants, their families, carers and advocates, and the evidence was not easy to hear.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee now calls on the government and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        to learn from these experiences, and to take actions to improve the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        for all participants, their families and carers. This unanimous report makes recommendations to government to improve the capability and culture of the NDIA, and provides an overview of the key issues about which submitters and witnesses have given evidence. The report covers issues such as the administrative burdens of engaging with the NDIS; the NDIA's methods of communication with participants, carers and service providers; and the NDIA's observance of model litigant rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also responsive, and importantly so, to participants' experiences. At a hearing in Geelong, we heard from a participant who spoke of the burden of repeatedly having to prove their disability. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Like many other older parents I cannot continue to live under the shadow of a forthcoming Annual Planning Review. These reviews have become Funding Reviews more than Planning Reviews. The prospect of having to prove [my son's] level of disability every year is too much for me. It also imposes a huge burden on his main provider whose team has to get all kinds of internal and external reports and assessments in place to satisfy NDIA.
       </p>
       <p>
        She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is so frustrating and I ask the question: Who benefits?
       </p>
       <p>
        Another participant at that hearing suggested NDIA staff should consult closely and regularly with participants to generally understand individuals' disabilities and needs. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ask the participant how their plan is working for them and what changes, if any, need to be made. Involve us in the process as it's our lives. NDIA needs to return to a person centred approach. Treat us like humans. If you are not sure what supports should be in place, come to my home and meet me. I will help you to understand my disability and how these supports help me.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee acknowledges these heartfelt words, and they are reflected in the sentiments attached to the five recommendations. The committee also acknowledges the actions that have already been taken by the NDIA and the Australian government to address the recommendations previously made by this committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee also recognises that there is a new federal government, which is currently undertaking a review of the NDIS, including its operations. The committee urges the government to consider and respond to the recommendations contained in this report. The committee will closely monitor any ongoing work which addresses recommendations made by this committee and will remain interested in any forthcoming government responses. The committee will also continue to hold public meetings and investigate the issues raised throughout this inquiry, with a view to providing a final report with further recommendations later in the 47th Parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee thanks everyone who has contributed to this inquiry by making submissions, expressing views through correspondence or providing testimony, often heartfelt, at our public hearings. In particular, the committee thanks NDIS participants who shared their experiences. The testimony of people with lived experience is crucial to identifying NDIS issues and to improving the operations of the scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues on the NDIS committee, and the secretariat, headed by Bonnie Allan. I wish Bonnie all the best for the future, as she's finishing up with the committee very shortly. On that note, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the House take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
