       <p>
        The Australian Federal Police's property portfolio is a key enabler of the Federal Police's capabilities, enhancing the organisation's readiness, capacity and ability to carry out its responsibilities for law enforcement investigations and national security. Providing secure facilities is a critical component of property being an enabler for the Federal Police to deliver its services at the level expected by the Australian government. The

        recently conducted a vulnerability assessment which identified eight sites as being high-priority targets. In response, the AFP proposes to undertake refurbishment and construction works on owned and leased premises. Refurbishment and construction works will focus on improvised explosive device protection, intruder resistance protection and system response capability. The estimated cost of $39.4 million, excluding

Subject to the approval of the project by the parliament, the fit-out is expected to commence in early 2017 and to be completed by late 2017. I commend the motion to the House.

        17 Phase 1B/1Câ€”Construction and upgrade of indirect fire support facilities.

       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to construct new and refurbished facilities and infrastructure to support the introduction, operation and deployment of the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        artillery capability at eight Defence locations across Australia. This multiphase project will give the ADF a new suite of ammunition, artillery command and fire control systems, and new delivery platforms for Australian regular army units across Australia. The project will provide functional cost-effective facilities designed to be suitable for the local climate and of a style consistent with the character of the sites and other comparable Defence facilities. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $57.11 million, excluding GST. This includes construction costs, escalation allowances, professional service fees, design, construction, Defence contingencies and information technology equipment. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to begin in early 2017, with completion expected by early 2018. I commend the motion to the House.
