       <p>
        I rise tonight to call on the generosity of those within my electorate of Paterson, who time and time again rally together to achieve truly amazing things. I would also like to acknowledge a true man of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 8 February this year,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Parker" rel="nofollow">
         Reg Parker
        </a>
        went for an early fishing trip in his near-new runabout, as he had done countless times during his 50 years experience on the water. Sadly, this was to be a day unlike any other. As Mr Parker headed back to shore at Tuncurry Beach, his boat was struck by a wave, throwing him into the rough swell. As the 77-year-old cried out a passer-by tried to throw him a lifejacket. However, tragically, Mr Parker was pulled underwater and drowned.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reg Parker was a man who loved fishing. Not only had his hobby grown into a passion over more than half a century; he had also established a successful business, Forster Fresh Seafoods, where he worked hard with his business partner. As Mr Parker’s son Greg later told the
        <i>

        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I always believed he had an affinity with the ocean, and that somehow his life would end with it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, Reg Parker’s life did end that day. But what we can take from this tragedy is a lesson—a lesson not to let a similar thing happen again. That is exactly the lesson which members of the Forster-Tuncurry community are now trying to turn into action.
       </p>
       <p>
        A campaign has been launched in my electorate to raise $25,000 to allow the Lower North Coast Branch of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving Australia
        </a>
        to buy a jet ski, dragnet and pontoon. This equipment will be docked in the Forster marina and named in Mr Parker’s honour. Clearly, this equipment could save lives. The local surf club already has 30 trained jet ski operators who could be at Forster marina within minutes of a triple-0 call. This would allow much quicker response times, with the nearest jet ski currently at One Mile Beach.
       </p>
       <p>
        The campaign is starting to pick up momentum, thanks to the generosity of local people who have been willing to dip into their wallets and open their purses for this worthwhile cause. I am humbled by the generosity of my constituents who always find something to contribute to a worthwhile cause. Today I would like to say thank you to everyone who has given of their time and money and to those who have pledged a donation to this cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to encourage anyone who is thinking about dropping a donation into Forster Beach Caravan Park to do so. I have also written to the Prime Minister to ask whether there is any possibility of a Commonwealth contribution to this very worthwhile cause. In just a couple of weeks, the tally has already pushed beyond $8,000—almost a third of the way. In addition, a company has agreed to supply a pontoon at cost price and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Great Lakes Council
        </a>
        has approved the mooring. This is wonderful progress and I am confident that together the community can reach its target.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians are known for their love of the water, and I believe that the Great Lakes has some of the world’s most beautiful beaches and swimming spots. Every year, these spots are a haven for locals and draw thousands of tourists for the summer. Tragically, this often means that people get into trouble in the water. It is not just children or weak swimmers; it can happen to anyone. A rip, for example, can take hold in seconds and drag someone far out into the ocean. In this environment in which our lifesavers work so hard to protect people, they cannot do their job properly without the right equipment. That is just what we need at the Forster marina. Lifesavers there have told me that this jet ski and pontoon could mean the difference between a rescue and a recovery. As a matter of fact, just one week after Mr Parker lost his life two people had to be plucked from the Forster Bar by a trawler. This is an example of when a jet ski could have been used.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have said before, the giving spirit of the Paterson residents never ceases to amaze me. We are a community blessed with hardworking people who are always willing to lend a hand and dig into their pockets. It is again time to call on their generosity for this worthwhile cause which will honour the late Reg Parker and help to stop another tragedy.
