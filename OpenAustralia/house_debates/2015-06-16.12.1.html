        These parliamentary amendments being made to the Investment Manager Regime are to address concerns raised by industry that certain provisions lack the clarity required to allow Australian fund managers to take advantage of the IMR concession as intended. These concerns were raised with the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. Significantly, changes to the schedule ensure that sub-underwriting arrangements will be covered regardless of the outcome of the arrangement. The reference to 'permanent establishment' clearly refers to either the relevant international tax agreement or the definition in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. In satisfying the widely held requirement, any independent fund managers may disregard any entitlement provided that the entitlement is taxed in the year it is received. There are other technical drafting errors that are also being corrected to avoid the need to make future amendments in parliament. In addition, and consistent with the Senate Economics Legislation Committee recommendation, a supplementary explanatory memorandum has been revised to provide industry with further clarification to cover certain terms and concepts. As the IMR seeks to remove uncertainties in Australia's tax laws, these changes will ensure that foreign investors can invest through or into Australia with tax certainty and that Australian fund managers can actively market their financial services globally.
