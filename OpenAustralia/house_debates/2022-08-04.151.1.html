       <p>
        It's been a fantastic week this week. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese earlier discussed the fact that at the Birmingham
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Games
        </a>
        we've so far tallied 123 medals, 46 of which are gold. I'm very proud to speak about five key star athletes from my seat of Spence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I'd like to congratulate Chris Flavel, who won a silver medal in the B6-B8 lawn bowls pairs, a fantastic result for him and his partner. We also have Lauren Mansfield, who won a bronze medal as part of the 3X3 women's basketball team. Finally, Callum Peters won his quarter-final bout in the middleweight section this morning. He's 19 years old and the youngest boxer on the Australian boxing team. I wish him all the best in his upcoming semi-final.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, I'd like to mention and wish best of luck to Miles Scotson, who will be competing in the men's cycling road race on Sunday, and Amanda Jade-Wellington, who is set to play in the women's T20 cricket team within the next five days.
       </p>
       <p>
        Spence is proud, the northern suburbs are proud and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , along with the rest of the country, is proud of all of your efforts in these games. I say to your families and friends: well done and congratulations on supporting your sports stars throughout their journey in these Commonwealth Games.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to congratulate two outstanding young junior sports stars in my electorate of Spence. Young Evan Barrett is a striker playing for the Gawler Hockey Club. He's just been recently selected to play for South Australia in the 12 years and under age group at the School Sport Australia championship later this month here in Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final star I'd like to speak about is 14-year-old Daniel Willment. He is set to take on the world later this year in November as part of the Junior Darts Corporation, or

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Darts_Championship" rel="nofollow">

        to be held in Gibraltar. I wish him all the best in emulating his idols, Phil 'the Power' Taylor, 'Flying Scotsman' Gary Anderson and Peter 'Snakebite' Wright.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done to everyone. It's an absolute honour to represent your country or your state at any level of sport, and it's quite clear to me and to the rest of the people in the suburbs of Spence that we have a lot of depth in our sporting talent pool. I'm sure over the coming years we'll have many more representatives from our electorate. I wish them all the best.
