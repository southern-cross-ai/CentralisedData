       <p>
        Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They're run by our mums, dads, brothers, sisters and friends. When small businesses thrive, so do our families and our communities. As a small-business owner myself, it gives me great joy to see local small businesses succeed through their passion, determination, hard work and innovation. One such example of this in Bonner is the Nurso.

        The Nurso is a cafe and plant nursery located in Chandler. This family run business is already a much part loved part of our local community. Earlier this month, they celebrated their first birthday. Catching up with the owners, Marni and Dave, it was fantastic to hear about their exciting plans to expand not only their business operations but also their community events and outreach programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 4 October this year, the Nurso has been offering a free breakfast club on school days for local school students. The team at the Nurso are passionate about giving back to the community and ensuring that all children attending school have eaten a healthy breakfast before starting a day of learning. They are also working on a youth day to help connect local children with community groups. There is always something happening at the Nursoâ€”go and see for yourself.
