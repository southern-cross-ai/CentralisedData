        I rise to talk about a function that I attended at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Windsor Park
        </a>
        , at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston Football Club
        </a>
        on Friday night. It was the presentation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons" rel="nofollow">
         New Horizons
        </a>
        awards. New Horizons is a club that creates sporting opportunities for people with a disability. I was absolutely amazed at the enthusiasm of the bocce, bowls, athletics and swimming competitors presented with awards. It is a fantastic organisations that has been going for a long time in northern Tasmania. I would like to pay tribute to Belinda Kitto, a wonderful young person who runs most of the sports in that organisation. It is a fantastic group of people with tremendous enthusiasm. I would like to particularly mention Mrs O’May, who was granted life membership on Friday night. Mrs O’May has been with New Horizons for a long time. She and her husband have been involved in taking rowing with a disability. She was treasurer for 11 years and has been on the board for such a long time. I pay tribute to the enthusiasm of these people, who are really keen on sport and have done a fantastic job. The New Horizons Club has done a fantastic job for the people of northern Tasmania, and I congratulate them on the effort that they put in.
