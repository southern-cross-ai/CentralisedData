        Celebrations were high recently when local cricket club the Grafton District Services Club Easts finally broke their drought and won the Clarence River Cricket Association premier league title. This is their first premiership in 27 years. Two players in the premier league side, local young talents Theo Lobsey and Pat Brophy, also played in the under-17s side for the club. Pat played alongside his father, Chris, in the premier league grand final. The skipper of the side, Shannon Connor, had an exceptional season, scoring in excess of 400 runs, including 94 in the grand final, and taking over 40 wickets throughout the season. Shannon was also named Player of the Match. Aaron MacFayden had a stellar season, making in excess of 400 runs and taking over 40 wickets. Jimmy Watters made his mark on the grand final, coming up from the second grade to play, and scored 47 runs. Team members included Luke Hayman, Tom Gerrard,

        Junior Sedan South Australian State Title. He took the lead in the 25-lap main event after 10 laps. He and his sister travelled with their family over 2,000 kilometres to get to the event. Jaiden races in the junior sedan category alongside his youger sister, Sophie. He has been racing since he was 10 years of age. Congratulations, Jaiden, and I look forward to seeing you race soon at the Lismore Speedway.
