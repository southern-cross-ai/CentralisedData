        I am rising to speak in relation to Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea. This is one of the Cancer Council’s leading fundraising events and the largest and most successful event of its kind in Australia. Over $60 million has been raised since it first began back in 1994. The official date is this Thursday, 28 May. But events can be hosted anytime during the months of May or June. Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea events have been known to be held in schools, in clubs, at work or even in the comfort of people’s homes. The funds raised during Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea go towards Cancer Council research, prevention, education and support.

        Last Monday, I had the pleasure of holding a community afternoon tea at which my guest speaker was the Minister for Human Services, Senator Joe Ludwig. I asked people to give a gold coin donation to fund raise for Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea. I can report that, with the generosity of the Petrie constituents who attended that event, we raised approximately $150 at that afternoon tea. I thank each and every one of those people for their voluntary donation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had the opportunity last Friday to attend at the home of one of my constituents, Narelle Armstrong. This was the second year that I have attended the Biggest Morning Tea that Narelle has held. Narelle Armstrong is a tireless fundraiser for the Cancer Council. Each year for the past few years Narelle has held a morning tea in her own home as part of the Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea month. This year, Narelle has held three morning teas to raise money for the Cancer Council. Narelle’s health has not been the best recently. I know that she feels that she is not contributing as much as she would like to. But there could be nothing further from the truth. Narelle has been officially recognised by the Cancer Council for her amazing fundraising efforts. I would like to place on record my gratitude and the gratitude of the community for people like Narelle who volunteer their time, their homes and their fabulous baking and tea-making skills to raise money to find a cure for cancer.

        We know that the Cancer Council do many amazing things. The money goes towards their help line, Cancer Council Connect volunteers, one-to-one support, clinical trials, making life easier for carers and groundbreaking research and new and improved treatments. I would like to thank all of the people who make an effort as part of Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea.
