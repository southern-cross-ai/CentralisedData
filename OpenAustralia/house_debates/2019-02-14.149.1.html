        I would like the congratulate the students and families of the South Grafton Public School; its principal, Peter Hickey; and the dedicated teaching staff, in particular Melissa Berry, Melissa McGrath and Janelle Buckley. South Grafton Public School has a wonderful story to tell. Over the last two years, the school has achieved outstanding academic, performing arts and wellbeing results. There are around 2,200 public schools in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , and South Grafton public was one of only 25 schools in the state and the only one from our region to receive a prestigious recommendation from the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority for its outstanding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
         NAPLAN
        </a>
        results in years 3 to 5. The school's focus on literacy and numeracy has seen its NAPLAN growth reach outstanding levels, and the K-3 results rise to the top two per cent in the state. So impressive are the results that the Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation now wants to do a study on how the school has achieved these excellent outcomes. The school has appointed two instructional leaders, Melissa Berry and Melissa McGrath, to support the curriculum leader, Janelle Buckley, to further assist the school executive and teaching staff.

        South Grafton Public School has also used increased government funding to introduce a range of programs to support the wellbeing of students, including a breakfast club, support with uniforms and help with small excursions to ensure all students can attend. It also runs high-quality debating, public speaking, band, sport, choir and dance programs, with the students regularly winning their categories. With its academic, performing arts and social reputation growing, South Grafton Public School has become the school of choice for many parents and families. I thank Peter Hickey and the teaching staff for their dedication to their students. Congratulations to all the students who have put in the hard work to get such wonderful results. Your achievements align with the school moto: inspiring excellence through pride. We are all very proud of you.
