        This week is National
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_Health_Week" rel="nofollow">
         Men's Health Week
        </a>
        . The theme this year is 'Healthy Bodyâ€”Healthy Mind: Keeping the Balance'. It is a great opportunity to raise men's awareness of the benefits of keeping healthy. I could not think of a better organisation to work with on this than the Mount Gravatt Men's Shed. As their president, Murray Rogash, tells me, men's sheds are much more than group workshops. They are health initiatives that improve their members' physical, mental and social health. Mount Gravatt Men's Shed offers a variety of health activities such as fitness classes. It counts among its 292 members a medical doctor, a psychologist and a minister of religion, who will help cater to other members' health needs. It also provides health check-ups to members through the Australian Men's Shed Association Spanner in the Works program.

        , I was pleased to contribute to the Mount Gravatt Men's Shed's health initiatives with a Men's Health Week morning tea. I was joined by a special guest, local

        Dr David Hunt, who spoke on the crucial health issues older men face and on the importance of regular check-ups. Dr Hunt has treated a number of men from the shed and he tells me the shed has made a positive difference in their lives, and that men's sheds are a vital community health resource. No doubt men's sheds help save lives. I am proud to support the men's sheds in my electorate. I commend them for their work in improving local men's health.
