        I rise to acknowledge and praise all the volunteers in the electorate of Werriwa. As in previous years, I planned to hold a thankyou morning tea during National Volunteer Week in May. Due to COVID, of course, that was not possible. Thankfully, I was able to acknowledge our volunteers via social media. Each awardee was acknowledged with a certificate and a letter of congratulations that were sent to them. Their stories have left a lasting impression, as have their heroics and humility. They are a wonderful set of people.

        Among the groups that were awarded a Werriwa volunteer award were the

        and Casula fire brigades. They worked all through the bushfire season, working closely with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsley_Park" rel="nofollow">

        brigade, who tragically lost two of their members fighting the fires. Awardees were recognised for their effort also during the COVID-19 pandemic. Groups like Turbans 4 Australia, who provided food and goods during the fires, continued to do that during the COVID lockdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate all the Werriwa volunteers, especially the recipients of the 2020 Werriwa volunteer awards, and thank them for their contribution. I look forward to awarding and speaking to volunteers in person next year, after COVID.
