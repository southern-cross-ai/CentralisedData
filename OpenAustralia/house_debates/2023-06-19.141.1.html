        There are many Australians who selflessly volunteer their time, experience and talents to our community and do not seek thanks nor recognition for what they do. I rise today, on behalf of my community in the electorate of Pearce in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        , to express a huge collective thankyou to these individuals who improve the lives of others. Four residents of Pearce were recognised in the 2023

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        was recognised for service to education, public health and the Korean community. Dr Lee was involved in developing national nutritional policies and dietary guidelines in Australia, held various positions at the Korean Academy of Scientists and Engineers in Australasia and the Nutrition Society of Australia and is a senior lecturer. Recognised for his outstanding service to cricket was Mr Toby Morell OAM. Mr Morell has been instrumental in many local cricket clubs, including the Quinns Rocks Junior, Joondalup Districts and Wanneroo Districts clubs. I have seen for myself how Toby involves himself within the sporting community, and I have seen the tears of pride well up in his eyes as he sees the proud smiles of recipients at award presentations, especially those of children and their parents. Also recognised, for his amazing service to motor sport, is Mr Edwin Taylor OAM. Mr Taylor has won many speedway championships and was proudly inducted into the Motorcycling Western Australia Hall of Fame. I have seen Edwin's concentration, experience and precision, and I have also had the joy to see how much he enjoys his riding.

        for outstanding public service in the coordination of support for the sporting, entertainment and creative industries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A summary of why Mr Etherton was recognised noted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As Chief Executive Officer of VenuesWest, Mr Etherton saw first-hand the economic and community impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responded promptly and effectively.

        He led the cross-government taskforce that established the $159 million COVID-19 Relief Fund. Recognising an opportunity to help the broader community and reduce food waste, Mr Etherton coordinated and led an initiative to use kitchens at Optus stadium, staffed by chefs from VenuesWest, Optus stadium and the
