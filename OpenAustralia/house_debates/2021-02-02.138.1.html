        Free and informed debate is essential for a healthy democracy. This morning, a defamation trial concluded in favour of one of Australia's most prolific political and university donors, Chau Chak Wing, with damages of $590,000 awarded to him. This is the second trial Dr Chau has launched against Australian reporters over whether he funded a $200,000 payment in 2013 to the now deceased, and allegedly corrupt, President of the United Nations General Assembly John Ashe. Some of the facts in this case are clear. Mr Chau's Australian contact, Sheri Yan, was charged by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI" rel="nofollow">
         FBI
        </a>
        with bribing Mr Ashe. But Mr Chau's role in providing funds has been obscured by defamation cases. Members may recall that on 22 May 2018 the member for Canning outed Mr Chau to the House by his FBI codename. The member for Canning also made clear that security agencies regard Dr Chau as part of the Chinese Communist Party's overseas influence campaign. Documents have come into my possession, including FBI case files, detailing the evidence the agency has gathered about Dr Chau, including translations. I seek leave to table these documents.

       <p>
        Leave granted.

        These documents reveal Dr Chau's private company made payments to Mr Ashe via one of Mr Ashe's bank accounts. They reveal the FBI regarded this payment as a quid pro quo arrangement to get Mr Ashe to speak at Dr Chau's 2013 conference. They reveal that in February 2016 FBI agents questioned Dr Chau about these payments and that he told the FBI it was, in his mind, merely a donation to alleviate poverty. Meanwhile,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        authorities charged Dr Chau's contact, Sheri Yan with bribery over the same payment. The documents also show the FBI has scrutinised other dealings between influential Australians and Mr Chau. In presenting these documents, it is my intention to simply allow for their scrutiny. The best antidote to those who seek to influence our political system, our universities and other important institutions that are the lifeblood of our democracy is sunshine. Let the light in.
