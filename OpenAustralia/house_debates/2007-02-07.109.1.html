        last month. I would like to put on record today the objectives of the awards and the names of those who were honoured at these special awards. The awards are aimed at honouring ordinary people doing extraordinary things on the southern Gold Coast. It is a formal recognition of the contribution they make to our community in making it a better place to live in. There were a number of judges and our job was extremely difficult. I was joined by Ron Workman, the chairman of the RSL, Councillor Daphne McDonald, Councillor Chris Robbins and

        , the state member, to make the decision on 17 nominees who were after six categories. The winners of the awards were awarded certificates and cash prizes on the day.

        of the Year was Beverley Humphries. She was recognised for her Currumbin Riding for the Disabled Centre. She was the driving force behind and an instigator for fundraising and the financial management of that centre. The community award went to Bev Hammond, who for 10 years has been secretary to the Currumbin state school
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . She has worked with the school and she has worked at the Olympic pool. She has run the organising committee for the art and craft festival at Currumbin state school for 20 years. Bev is also president of the Currumbin netball club.

         Jack Sinclair
        </a>
        . He was nominated by his scout troop leader. He is 14 years of age and he is attending Elanora high school in the local area. He is a great, academic young man. He won a scholarship to the school. He has worked with the

        and the young players there, training them, and also with the Japanese exchange students on bushwalking. He has made a great contribution not only to his local school but also to the youth of the area. He donated his prize of $250 to his father, who is doing a charity ride in Sydney to raise money for youth on the streets.

        The senior award went to Leo Redlich, a 91-year-old volunteer at Elanora state primary school. He has been volunteering there for 5Â½ years and is still making a wonderful contribution at his age. The sporting award went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Chalmers" rel="nofollow">
         Joan Chalmers
        </a>
        . She is a teacher at the Coolangatta State School and she encourages all children to play sport, no matter what standard they are at. She is also president and coordinator of the Stars netball club. She has worked tirelessly in that role for the last 14 years.
       </p>

        The award for services to the veteran community went to Mr Len Cooper. Len is chairman of the Veterans Support Centre, where he assists veterans with applications for disability pensions and to meet the welfare needs of dependants. He has continued this for many years. In terms of what it does for our local community, the outreach work that he does through that centre for the veterans cannot be measured. I think all of those people deserve our recognition and I encourage them to continue working in our community.
