        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on actions the government is taking to give our border protection agencies the support and resources they need to continue to secure our borders?

          it is the Abbott government giving our border protection agencies the support and resources that they need. And, ladies and gentlemen, it was the Labor Party that ripped money out of defence and out of border protection.

            The people of Australia know this. The people of Australia know that Labor was hopeless when it came to border protection.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
             The Abbott
            </a>
            government is putting money in. We are putting $630 million in. We are creating a secure border, which is absolutely integral for the defence of our country and for the way in which we can stop the boats and protect Australians from attack. We need to make sure that, through a new agency, we can establish the Australian Border Force, which will bring together the collective energies of our Customs and Immigration officials to ensure that we can address all the threats that deliver to our borders every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABF" rel="nofollow">
             ABF
            </a>
            will be a single integrated front-line operational border entity within the department that is charged with enforcing customs and immigration laws and protecting Australia's borders. The establishment of the ABF ensures that Australia has the capability at the border to manage this growth effectively and efficiently. The bill also introduces important integrity measures to ensure the support of management and to make sure that we have a professional and disciplined workforce that exercises its powers and functions with the highest standards of integrity. The integrity measures will increase resistance to criminal infiltration and corruption and will enhance government and public confidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reform also delivers important law enforcement and national security capability to stay ahead of the transnational and organised crime syndicates that seek to exploit any weaknesses in Australia's border arrangements. It is only a coalition government that can be trusted to secure Australia's borders. Why do I say that? Because history records that to be fact.

              Member for Watson, we are going to come to you and your record shortly in relation to border protection, because, whilst there is a lot of competition from amongst your colleagues, you were the worst immigration minister in Australia's history. Sixty-eight boats came on your watch. You were a shocker! We will highlight your record in months and years to come, because you are recorded as the worst immigration minister in Australia's history. We know that 50,000 people on 800 boats came during Labor's watch. They were not able to secure our borders. It is only the Abbott government that can secure our borders.

               <p>
                I did not hear any remarks against me. I did suggest that he refer to members as 'members' instead of 'ladies and gentlemen'. I did not think he was able to make that presumption.
