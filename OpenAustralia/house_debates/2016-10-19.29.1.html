       <p>
        Today I rise to reflect on the enormous contribution carers make to our nation. I would also like to inform the House of how Bonner will be celebrating its local carers this National Carers Week.
       </p>
       <p>
        National Carers Week is a time to celebrate and honour our unpaid carers. More importantly, it is a time to raise awareness of the work that carers do and the huge difference that they make. There are over 2.8 million unpaid carers in Australia. The unpaid work they put in represents close to two billion hours a year. Carers deserve our appreciation and support.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why I am pleased to have partnered with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSG" rel="nofollow">
         FSG
        </a>
        Australia to host a carers morning tea in Wynnum this Friday. Carers from the Wynnum-Manly community are invited to attend. This will be a great opportunity for local carers to learn more about the support services available to them. As one of my constituents, Gillian, has put it to me, 'It is important to let carers know they are not alone and that there is help out there for them.' Gillian had to give up her full-time work to care for her father for five years, while also caring for her son who has multiple disabilities. She tells me people often struggle to understand just how difficult it is for carers in her position.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why I continue to be a proud supporter of National Carers Week. The amazing contribution our unpaid carers makeâ€”
