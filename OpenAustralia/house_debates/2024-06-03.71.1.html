           I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for her question. We, on this side of the House, remember that it was the Leader of the Opposition's delegate that let someone out of immigration detention and gave him a visa. There was no monitoring, no reporting and no conditions. That person went on, allegedly, to commit an attack. He's been strangely silent about this, hasn't he? He's got a lot to say about others but very little to say about his own record.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are not interested in playing politics with this issue. We are interested in community safety, and I'd refer the honourable member to the evidence given in Senate estimates by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABF" rel="nofollow">
            ABF
           </a>
           , who corresponded what we have done in terms of community safety. A quarter of a billion dollars has been invested to support our strong laws. We have Operation
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEGIS" rel="nofollow">
            AEGIS
           </a>
           in place to bring together state and territory law enforcement officials, and, as he said, we know where all these people are.
