       <p>
        Today I rise to speak about a particular funding initiative contained in the Rudd government’s visionary 2009-10 nation-building budget. The $80 million contribution to the Springvale and Whitehorse roads upgrade project by the federal government is now fully funded in this year’s budget, with the allocation of $76.5 million towards the project. Along with funding of $60 million announced in the recent Victorian state budget this project will commence mid-year and be completed by early 2010. The Belgrave and Lilydale rail lines will be lowered and a new grade-separated road crossing will be built over the top, separating traffic and trains at this location forever. This is a great result for the residents and commuters in the federal electorate of Deakin and for the thousands of residents in the outer east in surrounding suburbs. These people know what it means to tackle that level crossing every day, to get to work or school or even to do the shopping. I know only too well how congested and frustrating it is at both peak and off-peak times.
       </p>
       <p>
        With 50,000 vehicles using the level crossing per day, the Springvale boom gates come down repeatedly to allow the 218 scheduled daily train services to pass. For local residents of Nunawading, these problems are magnified. Traffic jams on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springvale_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Springvale Road
        </a>
        are a daily occurrence that, in many ways, has the effect of splitting the suburb in two. There are even traffic jams there on a Sunday. Even pedestrians are delayed by this congestion when waiting to cross the rail lines whilst trains pass through, one after the other, keeping the crossing closed for several minutes at a time, especially in peak periods.  The Springvale Road railway crossing in Nunawading has, for two years in a row, been rated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RACV" rel="nofollow">
         RACV
        </a>
        as Melbourne’s No. 1 congestion red spot. The same crossing also won that rating in 2004.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project will reduce traffic congestion along Springvale Road and through the intersection with Whitehorse Road and will improve safety for road users by removing the level crossing where there have been 50 crashes causing injury and a death over the last five years. Pedestrian safety will also be improved through the provision of an underpass to provide for the safe crossing of Springvale Road. Local business owners will also experience positive outcomes through the improved station facility, pedestrian movements, car parking and especially through a reduction in traffic congestion, which often prevents access to prospective customers.
       </p>
       <p>
        A new railway station for Nunawading is a key part of this project and it will replace the old and outdated buildings that are used by thousands of commuters every day. There is also provision in the plans to allow increased capacity by possibly extending a third rail line. Residents in the outer east have been waiting a very long time for news that something is finally being done to fix Springvale Road. I would particularly like to thank the state member for Mitcham, Tony Robinson
