       <p>
        Colleagues, today I welcome to parliament the future captains, vice-captains and student leaders of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCJ" rel="nofollow">
         FCJ
        </a>
        College Benalla and Sacred Heart College Yarrawonga. I'm pleased that they've joined us here in the chamber. These inspiring year 11 students travelled to Canberra as part of their preparation for leadership next year. This trip has given them the opportunity to learn firsthand how our government works and, more importantly, learn from each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over lunch today we discussed issues they feel most strongly about, ranging from climate change to lowering the voting age to 16—which they were very much in favour of—family violence, honesty in political campaigning and the impact of drought on educational opportunities for young people in rural communities. I'm acutely aware that young people often feel neglected or ignored by politics that has nothing to offer them. I want them to know that we see you and we hear you, and we need young people like you in our parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the member for Indi, I will advocate for better employment and tertiary education options, accessible mental health support and real action on climate change. I know our rural and regional communities can offer a bright future to you and I'm looking forward to our next generation of leaders such as you. With study and exams, year 12 is difficult enough, even before the extra responsibility of a leadership role. I applaud these young people for putting themselves forward to serve as a voice for students, and I wish them all the very best for the year ahead. I am very proud to be their member for Indi.
       </p>
