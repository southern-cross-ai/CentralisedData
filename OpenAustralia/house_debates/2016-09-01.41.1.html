        It was such a privilege last Saturday to present the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Legion" rel="nofollow">
         French Legion
        </a>
        of Honour to David Mathias, who is 90 years of age. He lives in

        in my electorate of Richmond. The order is, of course, France's highest decoration and recognises his service as a signaller in the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Beach" rel="nofollow">

        in the Normandy operations. He completed six such crossings from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to France.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was such an honour to present the award to David, especially as so many of his family and friends were present. We also read a letter from the French embassy which included the following:

        France will never forget the thousands of soldiers who came to fight on French battlefields &amp; we still remain grateful today. It was in this regard that the President of the

        Thanks so much to David Mathias for his service and thanks to his family, and in particular his wife, Ann, for inviting me to be a part of their very special occasion.

        Following the war, Mr Mathias worked in London before moving to Australia in 1948 and eventually working on the

        </a>
        . In 1961 he married the love of his life, Ann, and their family grew to include a son, daughter and six grandsons, many of whom were able to attend the wonderful service on Saturday. They retired to the beautiful
