        Last month I had the distinct pleasure of joining forces with

        at the launch of Motorcycling Australia’s Rider Safety Campaign, to help turn the tide when it comes to motorcycling accidents on our roads. This is an important campaign that has the potential to prevent the deaths of and injuries to motorcycle and scooter riders. Being a keen motorcyclist myself and having two sons that ride, this campaign takes on personal relevance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Motorcycle and scooter sales have increased rapidly in recent years. Sales figures show that about 130,000 motorcycles were sold last year, an increase of some 10,000, or around nine per cent, compared with the year before. Unfortunately, the numbers of deaths and injuries are also rising and with those the compounding tragedy that strikes the families and friends of victims. Since 2002, the number of deaths has increased by 3.6 per cent per year. Motorcyclists account for almost 15 per cent of all road deaths despite the fact that their vehicles make up only 4.5 per cent of all registered vehicles in Australia. During last year alone 1,611 Australians died on our roads. Of those 240 were motorcyclists. Motorcyclists are 23 times more likely to be killed per kilometre travelled than car occupants and they are 41 times more likely to be involved in serious accidents.
       </p>
       <p>
        These statistics tell only a small part of the story. Quite frankly, every fatality causes untold grief for the family members and friends of the loved one lost. It is no secret that motorcyclists are much more vulnerable than other motorists. The casualty statistics are certainly gloomy, but those of us who are riders also know that riding motorcycles is a wonderful way of life. For me riding is being part of the scenery rather than just viewing it. For many Australians it is becoming a lifestyle choice, but we must take a proactive role and remind everybody that, while the roads are there to be shared, they are dangerous and that when you ride you should ride defensively and never ride beyond the road conditions or your skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Frustrated by the mounting road toll, Chris Vermeulen actually approached Motorcycling Australia about doing something practical and having a campaign on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        and radio and in the press about motorcycle safety. I would like to congratulate Chris on his passion to initiate this campaign. I would also like to congratulate Ron Kivovitch, the President of Motorcycling Australia, for Motorcycling Australia’s commitment to doing something positive to reduce the number of deaths of and injuries to motorcyclists on our roads. I wish Mr Vermeulen and his team all the best for the remaining MotoGP season and Mr Kivovitch and Motorcycling Australia all the best for the campaign. Once again I congratulate them on their stand to be proactive as to the safety and welfare of motorcyclists on our roads.
