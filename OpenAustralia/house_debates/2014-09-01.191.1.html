        On Saturday night I attended the 100th anniversary celebration of the Red Cross in Belmont, in my electorate. Belmont Red Cross has a proud history of working within the community and has worked with me on many community events. They were very visible during the fundraising that that took place within the Shortland electorate in relation to the bushfires in Victoria. They are a very committed group of volunteers who work very hard and have worked very hard over a number of years. Over the last five years they have raised $60,000. Each and every week you see the Red Cross volunteers out in the local shopping centres raising funds for the Red Cross. They are totally dedicated to the Red Cross. They are a group of women and men who range in age up into their 90s. They have been working in the Shortland electorate in Belmont for over 25 years. On Saturday night they also released a book about 25 years of the Red Cross in Belmont. It goes through all their achievements and it pays tribute to a number of their volunteers that have worked tirelessly for Red Cross. Congratulations to Belmont Red Cross. You do a great job and the whole of the community is proud of you!
