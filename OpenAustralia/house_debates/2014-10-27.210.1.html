        It is nice to see your face, too, Mr Deputy Speaker Jones. This morning I had the pleasure of attending a morning tea for Adults Surviving Child Abuse's, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCA" rel="nofollow">
         ASCA
        </a>
        's, national awareness day, Blue Knot Day, along with the member for Canberra, who is in the chamber. The morning tea was to raise awareness of this important initiative and the support network they provide for adults who have survived child abuse, as their name signifies. This year's Blue Knot Day focused on improving much-needed education and training initiatives in workplaces and organisations to support the five million Australian adult survivors of childhood trauma and abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        As members know, I have championed the issues of the forgotten Australians and the need for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Institutional Responses to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Sexual_Abuse" rel="nofollow">
         Child Sexual Abuse
        </a>
        in this place since I was elected, so it is with great pleasure that I continue to meet so many people who have chosen to dedicate their lives to supporting the victims of abuse. It is support groups like ASCA that have helped shape the royal commission inquiry and that will continue to ensure that the victims are supported long after the inquiry is completed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, Minister for Health Peter Dutton joined with ASCA President Dr Cathy Kezelman and the royal commission chair, Hon. Justice
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_McClellan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , to launch five videos which explore childhood trauma, including sexual, physical or emotional abuse or neglect; how this can impact survivors; and how recovery can be achieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the work of ASCA for producing these videos which have the potential to improve support networks for survivors and their loved ones, workplaces and health professionals, and for their ongoing work with the royal commission. Congratulations to
