        My question is to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister update the House on recent counterterrorism operations in Australia?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Last week the House may recall that I delivered the nation’s first
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security" rel="nofollow">
          National Security
         </a>
         Statement to the parliament. In that statement I spoke about national security in terms of freedom from attack or the threat of attack, the maintenance of our territorial integrity and political sovereignty, the preservation of our hard won freedoms and the maintenance of our fundamental capacity to advance economic prosperity for all Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Events of recent weeks demonstrate that threats to our national security are real and remain significant. We must therefore continue to be vigilant to ensure the safety of Australians and Australian citizens both at home and abroad. There is no greater responsibility on the part of an Australian government than to protect Australians from threats to our national security. In the current age, this becomes a more difficult proposition as time goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week in Melbourne a number of people were arrested and charged with terrorism offences. This action was a culmination of an operation which I am advised commenced in January of this year. The operation involved extensive collaboration and the dedication of around 150 officers from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         , the Victorian and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         police forces, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Security Intelligence Organisation
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales Crime Commission
         </a>
         and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Nineteen search warrants were executed in and around Melbourne and several items, including computers and removable data storage, were seized. Five men have been charged with terrorism offences and remanded in custody.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that the charges against the five men relate to offences against the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Two of the men have also been charged with offences against the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. Now that arrests have been made and charges laid, it is inappropriate to comment further on the individuals or the ongoing investigation. Those charged are entitled to the presumption of innocence. I would, however, like to acknowledge the work of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies in conducting this operation. The joint operation in Melbourne is testimony to the current levels of cooperation between the intelligence and law enforcement agencies of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments.
        </p>
        <p>
         The national counterterrorism level remains at medium. It has been at that level since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. The Australian government is committed to the task of combating terrorism. This requires a combination of an appropriate security response to individual incidents while broader strategies are also implemented to enhance community cohesion and lessen the appeal of radical ideology.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has a number of initiatives currently underway. First, the government is committed to ensuring the focus of Australia’s national security and counterterrorism laws remains on preventing a terrorist attack from occurring in the first place. As I have said, this is a difficult challenge. We cannot adopt a position which involves us simply waiting to punish those who commit terrorist acts and related crimes after they occur. We must do whatever we can to prevent such attacks from occurring. The government will therefore shortly be releasing a discussion paper on amendments to the Australian national security and counterterrorism laws. The discussion paper will help to establish an effective legal framework, which is fundamental to our ability to manage and respond to the challenges we now confront in our increasingly complex security environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Second, the Attorney-General has recently announced measures directed at dealing with counterterrorism. The measures are designed to deepen our engagement with at-risk communities to support them in resisting extremism. In addition to influencing individuals who may be affected by radical ideology, a national approach to countering extremism is critical and will form an integral prevention mechanism in Australia’s national counterterrorism strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Third, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
          Special Minister of State
         </a>
         has introduced legislation to establish a national security legislation monitor. The monitor will review the practical operation, effectiveness and implications for national security of our counterterrorism legislation on an annual basis. The monitor will be independent and consider whether legislation adequately protects public safety without reducing public freedoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, in last year’s National Security Statement I commented that the government would be developing a counterterrorism white paper. The white paper will respond to the continuing threat to Australia from terrorism. The white paper will include recommendations to adjust our current policy arrangements where required, with consideration to arrangements both at home and abroad. I expect to release the white paper later this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Beyond these measures it is of critical importance, of course, to maintain proper provisioning of resources for our security, police and intelligence agencies to ensure that the work that they confront on a weekly basis can be properly discharged. On that basis, the government maintains a close and continuing dialogue with our services about their future resourcing needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The events of recent weeks both in Melbourne and the tragic bombings in Jakarta are yet another reminder to us all that we face an enduring threat from terrorism both here in Australia and abroad. All Australians are rightly concerned. I wish to reassure Australians that the government and our law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies will continue to work hard to exert every effort to combat terrorism and to respond to new threats as they arise in our security environment at home and abroad.
