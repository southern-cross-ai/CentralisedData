        in the Logan Urban Design Awards. The 2016 Logan Urban Design Awards were held recently, and I would like to congratulate the overall winner, the Beenleigh Artisan Distillery's new visitor centre. Held every two years, the LUDA awards promote excellence in the design and creation of urban environments, large and small, within the City of Logan. The award winners across all categories are chosen for their clever design, delivering excellent community spaces that, in some cases, also put a unique twist on conventional buildings. Beenleigh Artisan Distillery's new visitor centre was named the overall winner for its striking modern cellar door design, introduced to the distillery's entrance by Blueprint Architects. The design was praised for re-imagining the iconic Beenleigh business, while also respecting its heritageâ€”and for the benefit of those in the House: it is the oldest operating rum distillery in Australia. The judges' comments said it was 'a project that exemplifies the value and contribution of good design,' and that the project's 'adaptive and contemporary design unites old and new to breathe fresh life into this Beenleigh business icon'.

        The Logan Urban Design Awards covered four categories: the Master Planning Award, awarded to master-planned developments and communities; the

        and Urban Infrastructure Award; the Architecture Award, awarded to exemplar building-form projects covering residential, commercial, industrial and institutional; and the Business and Events Award, awarded to exemplar businesses, programs or events that contribute our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate all the winners, as well as the nominees, on their commitment to quality design and development within the city of Logan, including: the Master Planning Award winner,

Those receiving commendation awards were: the Early Bird Breakfast Markets, Cavern Music Concerts, the Rum Rump and Rumba Festival 2015, and The Vicker Ridge. Congratulations to everybody involved for the tremendous work of continuing to build and grow our magnificent community.
