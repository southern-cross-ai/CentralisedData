         Tumbarumba Shire
        </a>
        was again on display on Saturday, 1 February, as more than 80 people trekked 13.88 kilometres on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_and_Hovell" rel="nofollow">
         Hume and Hovell
        </a>
        track, taking in some of the region's rich beauty and diversity—some of Australia's best in this regard. Started in 1985 by former Nationals leader and Deputy Prime Minister

        , Tumbatrek is steeped in the majesty of the natural beauty of Tumbarumba Shire and Australian political history. Now in its third year since I took over the reins and resumed the walk from Tim Fischer, I was joined by federal Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        Premier Barry O'Farrell—and I can hear the member for Grayndler;

        , you are most welcome to come along at any time, and certainly some heavyweight Labor figures have been on the trek as well. We were also joined by Albury MP Greg Aplin, as well as member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>

        </a>
        used the opportunity to encourage city people to travel to parts of regional New South Wales to see the beauty of our state, particularly in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Mountains" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . With many attractions, including a strong wine industry as well as local motels, sightseeing opportunities and proximity to major centres such as Wagga Wagga and Albury, Mr O'Farrell said the Tumbarumba Shire was a great place for Sydneysiders to spend their tourism dollar in the country. I would also argue that Victorian tourists are always welcome, too.

        A strong contingent also represented local government, with Tumbarumba Mayor Ian Chaffey and many Tumbarumba councillors joining in, as well as Temora Mayor Rick Firman and Wagga Wagga Mayor Rod Kendall. Many locals also joined the trek, including students from Tumbarumba High School. They are participating in the Tumbarumba 2 Kokoda program and will walk

        on Anzac Day 2015. They will do this in honour of Joseph Muggleton, a local boy who died fighting with the 2/12th Battalion in Buna in 1943 at the height of the World War

        Despite the heat, the 80-strong contingent enjoyed the trek and they were then treated to the hospitality of the Tumbarumba council for lunch. They also received a commemorative medal. Congratulations to all who participated, particularly the organiser, Marilyn Gilbert, of the council; she always does a great job. When you go trekking along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_and_Hovell_Track" rel="nofollow">
         Hume and Hovell Track
        </a>
        , along places with such romantic names such as Wild Mares Gully, the Coffee Pot rest point, Perrots Flat and finishing at Paddys River Dam, it is always a wonderful trek to go on. Tim Fischer started this back in the mid eighties, and you never knew what you were going to get with Tim. He would often do a press conference along the way. At the top of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Kosciuszko" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which is in the Riverina electorate, he would often hold a press conference and tell them what was going on in the nation. It certainly brought the nation's spotlight to Tumbarumba. I look forward to doing the trek again next year with the member for Grayndler.
