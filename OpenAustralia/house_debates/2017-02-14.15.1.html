       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate a part of my electorate which unfortunately is no longer part of my electorate—that is, the municipal area of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellharbour_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Shellharbour City Council
        </a>
        . Today, they received the news that their amalgamation with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wollongong_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Wollongong City Council
        </a>
        is not going to go ahead. I have to congratulate Mayor Marianne Saliba and especially my friend Kellie Marsh for their absolutely consistent, tenacious and strong work in advocating for their council to stay as a separate entity. I argued with them, stood by them and went with them to rallies to argue with them to prevent this amalgamation from taking place. Regional councils, unless they are in dire need of financial assistance, should not be amalgamated. These people are answerable to their little communities, they know their communities—they bang into them in the streets and the supermarkets. They know their people and they should be congratulated. I stand here today to say to them, despite all the moves made against them and all the tricks that went on behind the scenes, well done, particularly to Kellie and Marianne. And young Nathan, who is Kellie's son, has been an avid little supporter at all the rallies.

        Further, in relation to Closing the Gap in that area, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        work in Killalea estate park did all that was meant to happen with Closing the Gap for young Indigenous people, and their work in that region was absolutely fabulous. Thank you very much.
