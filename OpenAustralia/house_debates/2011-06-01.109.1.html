          I also want to speak this evening about the $7 million contribution that the federal government has made to the building of a superclinic in my electorate of Calwell. An announcement was made last year in July, and the realisation of this much-awaited and very important facility has come a step closer because on Monday an agreement was signed between the federal government and Dianella Community Health, the winning bidder in the tender process. I am delighted that Dianella was able to win that tender process. It is our local health centre. It has a very strong record of delivering health services to the people of my electorate as well as having very well-established networks with the local
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
           GP
          </a>
          community and the broader community.
         </p>
         <p>
          The signing of the agreement between the government and Dianella Community Health is an event that has been very warmly welcomed by my local residents. I have spoken many times in this House about the fact that our electorate does not have a hospital; therefore, anything that enhances the quality and the quantity of health services in my electorate is very much welcomed by all of us. We are a growing community. It is expected that by 2013 our population will reach some 177,289 people. This will be an increase of about 10,000 since the last census in 2006. It is expected to exceed 240,000 people by 2030. As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, Dianella is a growth area with a low socio-economic community and therefore the opening of a GP superclinic will provide residents with a new level of team based, patient centred health care which will happen under the one roof.
         </p>
         <p>
          We expect that once the superclinic is up and running we will have a lot more doctors and nurses. The allied health professionals will also be a part of this service, and overall there will be better access to health services for the people in my electorate. The Broadmeadows superclinic, as it will be called, is expected to include general practice, physiotherapy, dietetics, occupational therapy, podiatry, psychology, speech pathology and exercise physiology, with a strong emphasis on chronic disease care. The clinic will also focus on training and education for medical and nursing students and support training in medical related disciplines for people from disadvantaged groups such as Aboriginal and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
           Torres Strait Islander
          </a>
          people and refugees. I am particularly looking forward to the contribution that the GP superclinic will make to our local Indigenous community.
         </p>
         <p>
          The other issue I would like to raise in the House this evening is the recent budget allocation of $12.5 million to community radio. I have spoken many times in this House about the importance of community radio. It is a vital service for local communities. Last year I called on the federal government to support and acknowledge the importance of community radio. I am very pleased that this year the government has responded to my call, and the call of the community radio sector generally, and has increased the level of funding available. Community radio is run on a very, very small budget, but the benefits of it are immense. In particular, I want to congratulate Radio 3ZZZ, which is a community radio station that broadcasts in 75 different languages and reaches about 100 different Australian communities. The people from Radio 3ZZZ are very happy with the allocation in the budget. It is something they have fought a campaign for. On their behalf, I convey their gratitude to the House.
