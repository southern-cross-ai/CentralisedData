       <p>
        I rise to address this House on a matter of paramount importance: the wellbeing of working Australians. As the federal member for Holt, I'm aware of the challenges families face in Melbourne's outer south-east and across the nation. The escalating cost-of-living crisis, compounded by exploitative employment practices, possesses a significant threat to the livelihoods of working Australians. In response to these challenges, the Labor Party has developed a comprehensive plan to deliver meaningful support to working families. Our approach includes both immediate relief measures and structural reforms aimed at addressing the root causes of the cost-of-living crisis. At the heart of our strategy lies our commitment to creating jobs and getting wages moving again, which is the foundation of substantial economic growth. Over 650,000 new jobs have been created since Labor came into government, and, through our workplace reforms, we've delivered the highest annual wage growth since 2009. This is not just about numbers, it's about empowering individuals and families with opportunities for advancement and economic security.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we know that job creation alone is not enough. We also need to ensure that workers are treated fairly and have access to secure employment. That's why the closing loopholes legislation, championed by the Albanese Labor government, represents a landmark achievement. We have closed loopholes that enabled the undercutting of wages through dodgy labour hire practices to ensure the same pay for the same job. We have criminalised wage theft to ensure that a bad employer can never steal from the wages of their employees. We have strengthened protections for casual and gig economy workers to ensure that all workers are treated fairly and have access to secure employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        But our commitment to supporting working Australians goes even further. Our plan to support workers addresses a range of issues, recognising the varied nature of the challenges facing Australian families. We understand that addressing the cost-of-living crisis requires multiple approaches. Our cost-of-living tax cuts are a vital component of our plan. These tax cuts ensure that every single Australian worker receives a fair share of relief, with particular attention to those on lower incomes. In Holt, families are set to benefit significantly, with the average tax cut amounting to $1,321â€”substantial support for households grappling with the rising living expenses. Whether you're in Clyde, Cranbourne,

        or Tooradin, with Labor's plan, all taxpayers will now get a tax cut. Under Labor's plan, 90 per cent of taxpayers in my electorate of Holt will get a bigger tax cut.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond tax relief, our 10-point plan includes electricity bill relief, cheaper child care, expanded Medicare bulk billing, cheaper medicines, increased income support payments, free

        , more affordable homes and expanded paid parental leave. These measures are designed to provide support where it's needed the most, ensuring that working Australians have the resources they need to thrive. Moreover, we are investing in essential services like health care and education, which are vital for the wellbeing of communities in growing areas like my electorate of Holt. From building more affordable housing to expanding paid parental leave, our plan is focused on improving the lives of working families.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor Party's commitment to working Australians is unwavering. We understand the challenges facing families in Holt and beyond, and we are dedicated to delivering meaningful support to improve their lives. From tax relief to job creation, and from wage growth to worker protection, our vision for a fairer and more prosperous Australia is clear. Together, we can build a future where every Australian has the opportunity to thrive and to achieve their aspiration so no-one in this country is left behind.
