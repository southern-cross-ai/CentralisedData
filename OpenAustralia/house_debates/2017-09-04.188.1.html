        . I want to take the opportunity to thank all Australian fathers for the work they do. My wife, Louise, had the opportunity to attend the Scripture Union Queensland Father of the Year Award last week. It was started by Alan Male back in the 1970s. This year's winner was Jeremy Lange, who is a young father from Mackay, in the member for Dawson's electorate. Jeremy Lange, despite the fact he came from a broken family and also has a broken family himself—he has two children and he and his wife had split up—has gone on to be a wonderful father. I think that says a lot about Jeremy. I want to congratulate him.
       </p>
       <p>
        My own father, Ron Howarth, taught me a lot about work ethic, hard work and basic economics. He was a great provider for my family and still is. He taught me about money, debt, interest and small business. My wife's father taught her about unconditional love. Spending time together was important, whether it was washing the boat or polishing the bull bar. He was a strong, stable and constant father in her life and that helped her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fathers have a great responsibility and every one of them has a different contribution they can make to their child's life. I want to thank them for what they do and encourage them to keep doing their best as they raise the next generation of Australians.
