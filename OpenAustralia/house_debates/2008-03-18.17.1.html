        My question follows on from the answer just given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, but the question is addressed to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        . I refer the minister to the government’s decision to spend $2.5 million on the unions’ so-called ‘Tree of Knowledge’ and the conservation of a dead tree situated in Barcaldine. Does the minister regard spending millions of dollars on a dead tree as an appropriate use of government funding?

           in Barcaldine in Queensland because indeed it was the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell—rest his soul—who listed the Tree of Knowledge on the National Heritage List on 26 January 2006. I can understand that they did not check with former Senator Campbell before they asked the question, but maybe they should have checked with the member for Flinders, because this is what the member for Flinders, who knows his history, had to say on 28 January 2006:

           said the 150-year-old tree, 1000km northwest of Brisbane, had played a major role in Australia’s political and regional history—

          <p>
           ‘a major role’!
          </p>
          <p>
           But there is more. They could have spoken to the local member, the member for Maranoa, about what he thinks about the project, because the member for Maranoa said that he was pleased to see the historic symbol awarded such an honour. He said: ‘

                  I understand why we, on this side of the House, have 117 years of proud history and know what we stand for. Those on the other side of the House do not even know the name of their amalgamated party. The National Party is full of deadwood.

                  is all over the shop. We understand why they object to the commemoration of this historic site. But this historic site is important not just for the local community as an important tourist attraction but also to all those who want to understand the important history of this nation. That is why Labor has committed funding to support the ongoing protection and establishment of a memorial at the site, the interpretation of the Australian Tree of Knowledge story within the Australian Workers Heritage Centre, and the creation of a theme pathway to enable visitors to walk to the memorial and to facilitate access to the museum and town. We stand by this project and our history. You stand for nothing.

                   I hope in future that the minister will direct his remarks through the chair and not to the chair, as he did in his conclusion.
