        My question is to the Prime Minister. Since the government came to office the deficit has tripled, schools, hospitals and pensions have been cut and now the government is running scared on revealing the 10-year cost of its budget centrepiece. Why is the government delivering the exact opposite of what it promised Australians?

         Two premiers summed up the opposition leader's approach to spending very well.

           knew about the $20 billion black hole in their calculation of the tobacco tax! There was no coherent plan before that was revealed; now the black hole looks even deeper and darker.

           The other Premier who absolutely nailed the reality of these promises from the Labor Party was

           meeting where all of these promises and deals were signed—the 27 different funding arrangements relating to schools funding and the hospital commitment. Colin Barnett nailed it when he said that everybody knew the money was not there; everybody knew that she could not pay for it; everybody knew that it was a fantasy.

           They call out: 'rubbish'. Well, we will find out tonight. Tonight is the night they will tell us how they are going to fill in the black hole. I will be there. Will it be more taxes? I think it must be. Will it be lots more borrowing? I think that is going to be part of it.

          <p>
           We are living within our means. We have set out a budget. Every dollar of spending in that budget is funded. It is set out there. Everything is funded. We have set that out and we have set out our national economic plan for growth and jobs. We have set out generous increases in funding for schools and for hospitals—record funding every year. It is the highest funding for schools in the history of the Commonwealth, but it is tied to outcomes, because we think literacy and numeracy are very important. What we are doing is ensuring, for example, that children will be assessed when they go to school, so that they can be given the support they need.
