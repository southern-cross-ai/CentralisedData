        I was recently privileged as the member for Goldstein to visit a local community op shop that has been set up by a wonderful community organisation in the Goldstein electorate,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Life" rel="nofollow">
         Family Life
        </a>
        , whose motto is that they're transforming lives for stronger communities. One of the things I love about Family Life is its sense in understanding how critical family is as the foundation of a great nation—that individuals coming together to form families are the foundation for community and nationhood. They've opened a new second-hand shop in Cheltenham. Family Life does incredible work across the Goldstein electorate and all the way down the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        . One of their critical programs is the Creating Capable Communities program, which is a community-strengthening program developed by Family Life to assist residents of high-need neighbourhoods to overcome the social barriers associated with economic disadvantage. We know that economic disadvantage sits across all of the Australian community and there is an opportunity to do so much good work to be able to assist and help people. The effectiveness of the program over time is supported by an evidence-based approach of intergenerational improvements in the lives of parents and children. We should congratulate and welcome their approach. They do it through so many different instruments and mechanisms:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Lunch for Everyone, Healthy Little Rainbows, After School Club, Supported Playgroups, Creating Capable Leaders, Community Bubs, Community Houses, and community and family events.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the head of Family Life is its wonderful chief executive officer, Jo Cavanagh, who's worked there since 1994 and has led Family Life on a program of social innovation, evidence-informed practice and organisational learning, which has created sustained and transformative change for vulnerable communities and young people. Her ability to lead social change has been recognised by a

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Financial_Review" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Financial Review
        </a>
        and Westpac 100 Women of Influence award in the social enterprise and not-for-profit space. The 100 Women of Influence Awards showcase the country's highest achieving women each year. Since November 2015, Jo has held the position of adjunct associate professor with the faculty of law and business at

         Swinburne University
        </a>
        , which includes the Centre for Social Impact and the Centre for Transformative Innovation. In 2013, Jo was awarded an Order of Australia for outstanding achievement and service. She makes an incredible contribution to the community and particularly to Family Life. We thank her for it.

        Of course, Goldstein really does have exceptional civic-minded citizens. One of the things that we're very proud to do is hold regular morning teas with individuals who have excelled and demonstrated to the community the type of community and country that we want to be. We were very fortunate in our most recent one, on 2 February, to have congratulated

        students Regina Hooper, Isabella Gauci, Madison Rogers and Emily Webber ran a pop-up op shop—that's quite a mouthful!—to raise money for Sacred Heart Mission, with every $4 raised providing a meal to a local homeless person. Congratulations to them and to the initiative of Star of the Sea College. We also welcomed Josette Frost, who's a new resident in the Goldstein area, and Emily Liu, who has set up the local business Think Blooms in Martin Street and won 'Shops on Show' for the Bayside City Council's store Christmas display competition.

        It was wonderful to recognise a local Highett resident who has been actively involved in netball for over 58 years. We have a number of local sporting champions who have been acknowledged and congratulated as well. Lara Smith from Hampton recently represented School Sport Victoria in touch at the
