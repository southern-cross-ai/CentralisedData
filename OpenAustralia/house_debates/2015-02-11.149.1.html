        I rise to speak about an issue very important to my constituents, to local veterans groups and to anyone interested in making sure that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        ns have widespread access to quality hospital services. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        government is trying, yet again, to shut down the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Repatriation General Hospital
        </a>
        in my electorate. Let us be clear: this is nothing new. This state government has been trying to shut down the Repat since 2010 when their Sustainable Budget Commission recommended closing the Repat. Back then, the public backlash was so strong that they promised:
       </p>
       <p>
        The Repat Hospital is here to stay; the Repat Hospital will never ever be closed by a Labor Government …
       </p>
       <p>
        Then, in 2012, they closed the Repat's acute referral unit, which provided emergency triage for 7,000 veterans and patients every year. Now, they are just looking for another excuse to close down this iconic hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        The closure of the repat hospital will not only disadvantage South Australian veterans. It will also have serious, negative and long-term impacts on the health of the broader community, particularly people living in the southern suburbs—and especially my constituents who live in the suburbs immediately surrounding the repat.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a real concern that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Medical_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Medical Centre
        </a>
        , which is also in my electorate, will be overwhelmed by the flood of work if the repat closes. Last year, 25 per cent of all orthopaedic and urological elective surgery performed in South Australia was done at the repat. Flinders did less than three per cent. A senior surgeon has advised that Flinders Medical Centre, which is already at capacity, would be unable to cope with the extra burden of ophthalmology, orthopaedic and urology work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year I wrote to South Australian health minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Snelling" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Snelling
        </a>
        , on behalf of my constituents concerned about the repat's closure. The response I received six months ago said that it 'will continue to play a critical role in South Australia's health care system.' Now, six months later, they are announcing a proposal for its closure.
       </p>
       <p>
        South Australians know that the repat continues to be an important part of South Australia's hospital network and a centre of excellence in the area of veterans' health and mental health. They are not going to let state Labor close it without a fight. I encourage all South Australians to support the current 'Save the Repat' campaign. They can sign the petition to save the repat at www.savetherepat.com, on the 'Save the Repat' Facebook page, or in person in my office or at
