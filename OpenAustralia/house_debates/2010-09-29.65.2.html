         Mr Speaker, first and foremost, let me acknowledge the traditional owners of this land, the Ngunawal people. I pay my respects to their elders past and present. In honouring the traditional owners today, I also reflect back to the beginning of the previous parliament in 2008, which saw the historic national apology to the stolen generations. May the hope and spirit of that day live on through this and future parliaments so that the promise of a better life for all
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         is fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Speaker, I join those who have extended their congratulations to you over the last day on your re-election to your high office. I stand here today humble, but with a sense of awe and anticipation—a self-confessed chronic optimist. And there are many reasons to be optimistic.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am proud that we live in a country in which a woman who grew up in the western suburbs of Sydney—that’s me—can be asked by her parliamentary leader—a woman who represents the western suburbs of Melbourne—to reply to an address by another woman, our female Governor-General. I salute all the women and men who have worked towards enabling this possibility. As
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Excellency" rel="nofollow">
          Her Excellency
         </a>
         observed, this should not only be an inspiration to the women and girls of our nation but a confirmation to all Australians that we are a nation of freedom and opportunity, where you can aim high and see your hopes fulfilled regardless of your gender or where you were brought up.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a person who has dedicated her life to the teaching profession, I am also delighted to be able to work for a leader and a party that understands the transformative power of education. So thank you, Prime Minister, for today’s opportunity, and for the hope you embody for the people of my electorate on the New South Wales

         The seat of Robertson, which I represent, covers the southern part of the Central Coast. Just an hour and a half north of Sydney, our beautiful beaches, bushland and waterways make us one of Australia’s most visited regions. It is a place of stunning natural beauty—and a testament to the local Darkinjung and Guringai peoples and their ancestors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Robertson stretches from the northern shore of the

        </p>
        <p>
         The people of Robertson are generous of spirit and generous in sharing this part of the world with each other and with visitors. Many locals selflessly volunteer their time at surf clubs and our emergency services, such as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Fire_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Rural Fire Service
         </a>
         , and other community associations. The attractions of the Central Coast have proved a great drawcard to the growing population of Sydney, and the expansion of our population in the last 30 years has been enormous. This has led to ever-growing challenges to our infrastructure. Most evident is the pressure on our roads, our rail, our schools and our health services. Our daily commuter population is estimated at around 40,000 people.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a large percentage of retired people in Robertson, a large percentage of young people and a growing number of young families making their way in the world. Meeting the needs of this particular demographic combination will continue to be a challenge. But I stand here today as the Labor member for Robertson because both young and old, families, small business owners, workers and retirees understood something very important on 21 August this year. The people of Robertson kept faith with Labor. They voted for a Gillard government, because it is a government committed to social inclusion, a government focused on delivering access to better health and education services, a government committed to a better infrastructure, and a government with a clear and steady focus on a strong economy. These are the core issues for the future of Robertson and indeed the whole of regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my work here in the parliament and at home, I bring the values instilled from a loving family life and significant role models who have influenced me. Those who know me well know I am a person who treasures my family, my Irish heritage and my Catholic faith. I am the eldest daughter of six children born to Jim and Mary O’Neill. Jim was a wild hurling Irish Corkman who we lost to cancer back in 1989. He brought his Irish eyes, his Irish accent and his blushing Kilkenny bride to Australia, determined to live as big a life as possible. Mary, my mum, was lured here by film-reel vision of Aussie washing drying in the sunshine on a Hill’s hoist, and the sight of a backyard populated by happy, healthy children with access to a quality education and the chance to live out their dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
         My parents started life like so many young immigrants—with hope in their hearts, a capacity for hard work and a love for the best parts of the culture they left behind. Our family are all proud Australians, who celebrate our Irish heritage through dancing, music, song and story—ways that connect us to our ancestors. My mother, Mary, is in the gallery today, along with my husband, Paul, and our three children, Caitlin, Brianna and Noah. I am glad to share this day with my brother, Sean, his wife, Jacqui, my Uncle Mike and my cousin Christine.
        </p>
        <p>
         As well as my sense of family, I bring with me a love of place and country. I travelled north—some might say emigrated—from Sydney to the Central Coast 25 years ago. I had just married Paul, a surfer who loved the left hand surf break at the beach that the local custodians call Tudabaring Headland. It means ‘Where the waves pound like heartbeats’. More recent residents know it as Copa Point. Paul and I lived and raised our children just up the road from that magical surfing break.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouddi_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Bouddi National Park
         </a>
         lies just to the south. In the local Aboriginal language, Bouddi means ‘heart’. This area is literally our family’s heartland. There is a lot to love.
        </p>
        <p>
         Beyond family and place, my enduring love, my passion, is education. I love its power to transform the lives of those who embrace it. Education enriches and fulfils those who share it and those who receive it. It is a great source of inspiration to me that it is an educator,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Mary" rel="nofollow">
          Mother Mary
         </a>
         MacKillop, who will become Australia’s first saint later this year. Mother Mary established an orphanage and school at Kincumber.
        </p>
        <p>
         I fell under the thrall of education at the age of four. Listening to the Kindergarten of the Air, I can still recall the black-and-white lino tiles on the floor, the formica table, the radio on the kitchen bench and my mum smiling at me as she turned on that radio and opened to me the wonderful world of learning. Mum did her best to keep me entertained with stories and promises of being allowed to attend school when I was big enough. From the age of about 3½ I stood at the white painted fence of my parents’ first home in Curran Street, Blacktown and pointed out to my mother every single school uniformed passer-by who was smaller than I. I was hoping each day to persuade her to allow me out the gate and up the road to school, where I knew something wonderful was happening. Finally, at 4½ when the first day of school arrived, mum and I and my sister and brother headed up to St. Andrews, Marayong. I disappeared into a classroom and found a desk. I started school by myself. There was no teacher in the room and I am told that my disappearance caused some concern.
        </p>
        <p>
         I tell this story today because it illustrates something I now know as an adult, who has given 25 years of her professional life in the service of education. We all know how vital the early childhood years are in developing a disposition for learning and a disposition towards schooling. This is an ongoing challenge for all Australian parents, carers, teachers, elders and community leaders: to link kids with learning.
        </p>

          TV
         </a>
         , video and the iPad, but it is now clearer than ever that technology plays a vital part in making quality educational experiences accessible to those who want to learn but are confined by age, by disability or simply by the tyranny of distance from people and the options to select for learning that excites them. That is why, as an educator, the possibilities of stable, high-quality, high speed internet access where we live, through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         , is a policy of which I am very proud. In my own story, learning happens both inside and outside classrooms. It is my belief that learning happens both inside and outside programs and formal curricula.
        </p>
        <p>
         Learning is a natural phenomenon—it is part of our everyday life—and, when formal education meets a learner at the point where their interest lies, learning is a joyful experience of growth that benefits the individual, the community and our national productive capacity. I acknowledge my professional colleagues, my fellow teachers and the work all teachers do in schools. But I am mindful that not all students find school such a positive or enabling experience. That is why we need to continue to adapt and change how we offer education. We need initiatives such as trade training centres and a full range of learning content and learning sites to ensure all students, whatever their age, are able to discover and develop their talents.
        </p>

         I personally thank Miss Walker of

         ’s, Girraween, my first class teacher, who opened up new worlds to me by teaching me how to read. It has been a real source of joy to read each night of my life by dim light and discover other times, other worlds and other people’s stories. I bring all of that reading with me and deeply understand the importance of basic literacy for all. I also must thank my high school teachers, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritans" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , while Mrs Yule revealed the beauty of poetry to me in a single lesson on Donne. Miss Milne gave me words to understand literature and language. Mrs Sneddon and Mrs Malone, who arranged theatre and concerts, opened my ears to orchestral music and my eyes to new ideas that have nurtured in me a deep love of music and the arts. I also want to thank Sister Magdalena for being a powerful model of compassion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Making these kinds of interactions available to all students is so important, for teaching is much more than books and exams, results and certificates. Teachers prepare us for life in the community. I see schools as critical sites in which our citizens practise our democratic capacity—our capacity to get along with one another. We need to practise ways of being a good citizen in our time, our country, our region and our world. We need to think and learn about our beliefs and our values as citizens in a democracy. This is such an important field that I think deserves much greater emphasis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Values education is in fact the field of my doctoral studies, and one in which Australia has some world leaders. One of them is Professor Terry Lovat, my mentor from the

          University of Newcastle

         and my colleagues and students at the University of Newcastle for their inspiration and humanity. I mention Professor Keith Crawford, as a wonderful writing and teaching partner.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our educational infrastructure is such an important part of our future. The renewal of our school buildings in Robertson is a sign of good economic management. Indeed investment in infrastructure, in every sense, is so important for our region. Our infrastructure deficit on the Central Coast is a major structural impediment to economic growth that impacts on the quality of life of our residents and visitors every day. That is why, as I was campaigning at the doors of our local residents, I was proud to say that it was the Labor Party who, in our first term in government in this new century, installed our first federal minister for infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our $20 million investment in advancing fast rail, and the increased role for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         that will drive that development, testifies to Labor’s commitment to the regions outside major cities. I acknowledge the work of all those who plan and all those who build our roads. It is the task to which my Irish-born father gave his working life and the tradition which continues in the work of my four brothers. I fondly recall the awe in my father’s voice as we drove north on a holiday not long after the completion of the first section of the F3. For the people of Robertson, that infrastructure build was the beginning of opening up the Central Coast and the regions north of us. In the immediate future, the engineering possibilities that are now known to us offer the potential for a critical link between the F3 and the M2 that would decrease travel times to Sydney for workers, for tourists and for businesspeople who travel that route.
        </p>
        <p>
         Time on the road is time away from family and friends. In my time as the member for Robertson, I understand that a key part of my role as a connector of all levels of government is to ensure that local infrastructure deficits on our Central Coast are redressed and that future planning for our region ensures that we build with an eye to the future. In this regard, I make no apology for articulating today my determination to seek the earliest possible rollout of the National Broadband Network for our region.
        </p>
        <p>
         We live in a global village with business, health and learning opportunities that have the capacity to radically improve our lives through stable, high-quality digital connection with others outside our region. In Robertson, as in other regional areas across our great nation, we have a population that is in love with where we live. But we need high-quality jobs to ensure that our children can plan for future lives where we live. Currently, so many of our young people, our young parents and our experienced workers can only find work or seek out professional challenge by leaving the coast. Some coasties leave permanently; others commute daily. Such a loss of capacity in our region has too great a cost both socially and economically. It is my view that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         and the opportunities that it offers to large businesses and service providers to relocate physical capital to the regions is the opportunity of our lifetime to re-envision the possibility for lives in regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to take the time remaining to me to acknowledge my family, friends, students, professional colleagues and my fellow Labor Party members, a number of whom have made their way here today. I have long held the belief that we can achieve far better and far greater things when we work alongside one another in a spirit of hope and possibility for the future, shielded from the loud voices of cynics who would have us abandon our dreams. I stand here today only because friends and supporters have at various times of my life encouraged, enlightened, challenged, debated with me or guided me in good faith. The fact that our hard-won victory in Robertson brought one of the seats that tipped the balance in Labor’s favour is a source of great pride for all involved in our campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had a great team working with me. There are many people to thank, from those who were there at the beginning to everybody who pitched in and handed out on election day. Let us keep working for the future of the place we love. My special thanks go to Jamie Clements, George Houssos, Matt Pulford and Alison Rahill, Trish Moran, Paul Lister, Richard Mehrtens,

Our fellow citizens have sent us here to govern wisely, with dignity, with grace, with integrity. The structure of this parliament is not an aberration; it is the will of the people. There will be learning to do, new skills as legislators to be acquired, new ways of being parliamentary citizens to be enacted and new ways of advancing our nation that will be sought of us.

             I start by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet—the elders past and present. In this context, Mr Speaker, may I say how delighted I am to be joined on this side of the chamber by the new member for Hasluck.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am proud to come to this parliament as the representative for the seat of Ryan, located in the heart of Brisbane and the great state of Queensland. It is a state that has sent to this place people of the calibre of the late Senator Neville Bonner and the late
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Killen" rel="nofollow">
              Jim Killen
             </a>
             —old and dear friends. They both brought a natural sense of propriety and fair play, a sense of humour, and both made this parliament a better place for their presence and contribution. I also take inspiration from the constituents of Ryan—people like Dimity Dornan, Professor Ian Fraser and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Perkins" rel="nofollow">
              Kieran Perkins
             </a>
             —all real achievers who lead by example. They teach us that within our own communities there are people who will change our lives and give us hope and inspiration for the future. With this inspiration I stand today in awe of the remarkable institution that is this, the Australian parliament—a place where, in Melbourne, over a 100 years ago, my great grandfather, Sir George Pearce, who was sworn in as a senator of the first parliament of Australia and who later served as minister for defence and as the first senator to be
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">

             . He also established the

             . Sir George remains the longest-serving member of the

              Australian Senate
             </a>
             . In this current House, only my good friend the member for Berowra comes close.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am humbled by the trust that almost 100,000 electors of Ryan have placed in me. The responsibility to represent the electors of Ryan is an honour and a challenge. I take it on enthusiastically, knowing that only by working closely with my electorate can I properly represent them. I am also humbled by the fact that I am the 1,085th member of this House since Federation—indeed, less than the number of students enrolled at Ferny Grove High School in Ryan. To be one of such a small number over that lengthy period is an honour—an honour that I can only repay by honest representation and hard work. To the people of Ryan I give that pledge. I will do my very best to represent their interests in this parliament. That does not mean that I must abandon my own judgment or become a slave to the latest poll. It does mean that I must exercise my judgment to best serve the people of Ryan and Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
             I come to this parliament at a time of enormous challenge. I come to a parliament that confronts that rare occurrence of a House finely divided—a government without a clear mandate. I approach this challenge with a determination to act in the best interests of my constituents and our country. I approach it with a confidence in my Liberal heritage and the strength of the Liberal-National Party brand. I would not be here without the support of Bruce McIvor and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
              LNP
             </a>
             organisation, as well as so many friends and supporters—too numerous to name now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like so many Australians, my education has been framed by meeting the challenges that confront us all in life. Indeed, there is nothing like raising a family, as I have done in Ryan, to build community links—strong links that endure until this very day; strong links that have been built upon and strengthened through my role as a Brisbane city councillor. I have built my own business, which was based in Ryan. Out of all this, I have developed firm views as to decision making and representative politics. Whilst those views have been developed at the coalface of business, in the warmth, delight and challenge of raising a family and in city administration, they are the stronger for it. I have also had the benefit of working with two special leaders, whom I mention today—Sir John Carrick and Lord Mayor
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
              Campbell Newman
             </a>
             . I recall Senator Carrick as a great mentor and a man of immeasurable compassion. He is still passionate about the importance of education. He said that, when considering new legislation, we must always be mindful of our responsibility to assist those in need. Campbell Newman campaigned with a vision, embracing actions not words. He constantly reminded our team that we must be prepared to take decisions for the long-term benefit, across election cycles, and not be limited by the term of government. His objective has always been to make a plan and get things done.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am a passionate advocate of the view that it is the individual who stands front and centre as my ideological cornerstone and that it is by empowering the individual that we will unlock the real potential of our society. One only has to look at the contribution of Ryan volunteers of the calibre of Jutta Godwin, Sally Johannsen, Gwen Braga, Joan Redgrave, Richard Speechly,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Jones" rel="nofollow">
              Helen Jones
             </a>
             and Jocelyn Slater—all people who have enriched the community in Ryan through their dedication and hard work.
            </p>
            <p>
             I strongly believe that government must provide the environment to give individuals the opportunities to create and succeed, but not to unreasonably interfere or to restrict the freedoms and rights of individuals. I believe in a hand up, not a handout. In this place we must stand up for what we believe. That is what people want and so they should. I do not say that in a confrontational way but rather to say that I know that my constituents, like all Australians, want to know where their representative stands. I welcome the opportunity to set out my views and concerns about our nation today.
            </p>
            <p>
             I stand for the future of our cities. Growth in our cities is inevitable. Time itself teaches that lesson. Failure to properly plan for that growth is an abrogation of responsibility. That failure is what concerns people, not growth in itself. In council, as part of Campbell Newman’s leadership team, we faced a city neglected by Labor over many years. We faced a hostile Labor council more interested in politics than outcomes. For four years we had to negotiate the challenges of delivering good government without a majority on the floor of council, but we had a clear vision and a plan to deal with population growth, and we got on with the job.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Brisbane, a city of almost two million people, we are now achieving great outcomes. Brisbane provides a balanced approach to resolving traffic congestion, not just through
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransApex" rel="nofollow">
              TransApex
             </a>
             —a four-tunnel, one-bridge solution, and the largest road construction program in Australia—but also through record investment in public transport. This has resulted in record bus passenger growth from 48 million in 2004 to more than 77 million in 2009-10. In Brisbane we have also set new standards in environmental initiatives, not by imposing a great big new on-off and now on again tax but with practical action, not rhetoric—action by the whole community, house by house, street by street, suburb by suburb. The results speak for themselves and the council led by example. Brisbane is now the largest purchaser of offsets and green power of any level of government in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cities need the capacity to plan their future over the long term. That means more than a three-year funding cycle. Labor state governments have failed our cities. National government has a responsibility and an opportunity to work with the councils in our major cities, the engine rooms of our states and territories, to provide a city driven infrastructure plan for the long term. Successive governments can claim a proud record of regional development, but governments must work to deliver good government services for all Australians, regardless of where they live. That means that, in the rush to look after our regional areas, we do not ignore the needs of our population centres, our cities. Because of their sheer size and infrastructure needs, cities require special attention and planning. As much as we need a minister for regional Australia we need a minister for cities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before I entered politics I ran an event management business. I know the challenges and pressures of small business. From running a range of major events I saw an opportunity for my company to specialise in the emerging technology sector. I worked closely with the telecommunications industry. I sat on the Queensland board of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATUG" rel="nofollow">
              ATUG
             </a>
             . I learned on the job and I took that passion and understanding to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
              Brisbane City Council
             </a>
             , where I campaigned for an optic fibre ultra-high-speed broadband network to every premises in Brisbane to really entrench Brisbane as Australia’s new world city. The goal was to provide open access to all potential users on equal and equitable terms. We assessed the technical, financial and revenue risks as well as alternatives for implementation. The council came up with a robust case and financial model, followed by a successful trial. The plan was feasible, affordable and it did not cost government—and, indeed, taxpayers—tens of billions of dollars. It brought together the best in the business and provided clear demonstrations of what government and business can do together.
            </p>

             Co did not want to know about it. Indeed, they threatened to build over what Brisbane planned. They were more interested in entrenching the monopoly of themselves and Telstra. Perhaps the best analogy is in the provision of road infrastructure by government for all road users, not just for one brand of motor vehicle. Just as roads connected communities and economies in the 20th century so will broadband connect them in this century. I support the rollout of a high-speed broadband for everyone but not the untested, uncosted charade that is

            <p>
             A significant challenge of our modern connected world is that, whilst the internet has opened the information highway, the social networking aspect of the web raises real questions about social isolation. A teenage girl may have hundreds of Facebook or Twitter ‘friends’ but how many of those can she play sport with, go out with for a cup of coffee, go to the beach with or share a hug with? This may be a new paradigm showing us the future of social interaction, but there is a real worry that social networking will lead to a generation whose only significant social life will be on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Social isolation is not a problem that relates just to the elderly but our ageing population also requires special consideration. At the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
              Red Cross
             </a>
             annual general meeting in Brisbane last week, Professor Laurie Buys spoke about social connectedness and active ageing. Just to put the potential impact into perspective, it is worth noting her statistics: by 2050, one in two voters will be aged over 50 and, by 2055, 78,000 Australians will be aged over 100. We need to acknowledge not only the cost but also the potential benefits of age. Australians aged 55 and over contribute an estimated $74.5 billion per annum through voluntary, unpaid and caring work. We must not dismiss their enormous contribution and potential. That is our challenge.

             and now a proud Australian. Without these great Australians, and so many others, our lives would not be enriched by the real contribution that other cultures bring to our society. Australia is the result of our immigration over generations. We are richer for it.

             It is a natural move from the importance of our multicultural Australia to the importance of our neighbours. In our region we have a particular responsibility to assist our developing friends, not in a patronising way but with a genuine hand of friendship and support. The developed world has not found a successful form of providing aid to our neighbours in much the same way as we have much to learn in helping our own

             . In both cases we must persist, because if we fail we let our neighbours down and indeed our first Australians.

             Papua New Guinea, our closest land neighbour, faces real challenges but is a vigorous democracy and a good friend. At the same time, I look with encouragement at the progress from war to peace in Bougainville. In Bougainville we have had a remarkably successful peace process, but we need to do much more to assist them in building capacity. Failing to build that capacity to govern will cast a real shadow over the forthcoming referendum on independence.
            </p>

             We must also help the

             is doing a great job in supporting the government, but they cannot remain there forever. Indeed Solomon Islands appears to be the reverse of Bougainville—there has been substantial work on state building yet real work still needs to be done on peace building and conflict resolution. Australia has played a major role in both post-conflict situations. In both places we must provide the continuing support required to reach a successful conclusion.

             and Fiji need our assistance to allow them to work through the challenges of past conflicts. As always, open and frank discussion is critical.

             , which is just returning from operations in Afghanistan, having lost a number of soldiers on operations. I attended the memorial service and funerals for privates Tomas Dale and Grant Kirby, and Lance Corporal Jared Mackinney in the last few weeks. Let us never forget these brave Australians and all of our troops and veterans who have answered the call whenever their country has asked. Equally we must never forget that these courageous men and women have volunteered knowing that they put their lives at risk to ensure our safety. It is timely to remind the House of the coalition’s commitment to ensure that their entitlements reflect the contributions and sacrifices they have made through the indexation of the DFRDB and the DFRB.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, let me say this: if this nation fails to cloak our soldiers with the full protection of the law when they go into battle, we fail them all. The rules of engagement must be crystal clear and our support strong. If we put Australian troops into the heat of battle and expect them to take enormous risks on our behalf, we cannot expect them to be split-second lawyers as well. I must make it very clear that I am not commenting about any current matter because I do not have all the facts at my disposal. However, we must recognise that our troops go to war on the instructions of our government. They must be able to do their job in accordance with the rules of engagement without having to worry about whether those rules might be interpreted differently at a later time. I say this as an Australian but also as a mother of a serving member of the

             While there are and always will be many issues and projects which divide us in this place, there are also those that have bipartisan support at all levels of government because we all recognise their long-term strategic benefit. One of those projects is the square kilometre array radio telescope project—known by its acronym,

             —which is planned to be one of the great science projects of the 21st century. Australia is in the last stages of an international site selection process. The SKA offers what is likely to be a unique opportunity for

             . It will facilitate science of the highest quality for decades. This project can put Australia at the forefront of that research in astronomy and in a range of other fields. It will have a significant economic and social impact. It is worthy of support from all of us.

             It is important that I say something about my family. From Sir George Pearce to Len Righetti, the Mayor of Malvern on three occasions; to my parents, Alan and Janet Righetti, who are here today; to my sister, Katie, and to Peter, Caroline and Robert; and of course to my husband, Ian, and our children, George and Caitlin: none of this would be possible without you. In so many ways your family makes you, strengthens you and at times challenges you. That is how it always is. Family life is so important to our social fabric and our communities.

             I do not come to this place with a closed mind. I look forward to the input of my electors. For those of you who are cynical about our political system I say: get involved, join a political party and above all have your say. Successful political communication is not a one-way process. It works best when there is active and informed input from constituents to members and senators. I am honoured to be given this opportunity by the people of Ryan. I am passionate about my community and I am passionate about my country. I am determined to make a real contribution to Ryan and Australia.
