        I want to acknowledge a remarkable constituent of mine, Ken Simons, who I hope is still watching this evening. If he is, I want to say to him that we are all thinking of him and praying for him as he deals with a very significant illness. Ken was born in Newtown in Geelong in 1939. At the age of 16 he left school to become a butcher. In 1961 Ken enlisted in the

        </a>
        and, after a year, decided to enlist in the regular
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        . Ken was posted to the 1st Battalion,

        </a>
        after recruit and core training in November 1961. He served around Australia and in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua" rel="nofollow">

        during the Dutch handover to Indonesia. In 1965 Ken was deployed to Vietnam as a corporal section commander.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ken's regiment was attached to the

        as well the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation. Upon his return to Australia, Ken was posted to the 3rd Training Battalion at Singleton as a sergeant instructor. He was posted back into 1RAR as an anti-tank platoon sergeant and was discharged from the regular Army in 1967 with the rank of sergeant. Ken married his wife, Dawn, that year, and had two children, Lloyd and Samantha. He returned to the Army and served with the 10th Medium Regiment,

        , where he taught until 1978 as a warrant officer class two.
       </p>
       <p>
        After that, Ken would go on to become a welder and pipeline inspector and was elected president of the Victorian branch of the Federated Gas Employees Industrial Union. Despite his remarkable career of loyal service to our country in our defence forces, he selflessly continued to serve the community outside of it. He was a founding member of the Geelong Vietnam Veterans Association, which later became the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. He was a stalwart of the Lara

        . Aivar Mikelsons said: 'Ken has done a lot for the members of the Lara RSL sub branch. He's done a heck of a lot. He's one of the hardest working people I know.'

       <p>
        Sam, Ken's daughter is vision-impaired, which drove Ken to become involved in the Riding for the Disabled, helping kids ride horses. He was active in the Scouts. Ken was also the past president of the Geelong

        . He was the Lara Citizen of the Year in 2012. Most importantly, he's a life member of the Geelong Ballroom Dance Club. A fellow member, Andy Teffry, said, 'He's a very good ballroom dancer, especially with his wife, Dawn.' John Pepperdine, a stalwart of the Lara community, said, 'Ken is a great Australian who has worked hard for veterans in his community.' Ken, during his life, has made his mark. He has made a difference, and his work and his fight against his illness has been an inspiration to us all. We are praying for you, Ken.
