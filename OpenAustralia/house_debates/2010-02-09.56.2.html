        <p>
         The answer to the honourable memberâ€™s question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Since the building was opened in 1988 electricity consumption has been reduced by 40% and gas consumption by 73%, with a total energy consumption reduction of 58%.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This has been achieved through a number of measures, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          improvements in air conditioning system fans and pumps;
         </li>
         <li>
          upgrades to the heating and air conditioning control system;
         </li>
         <li>
          upgrades in the building management system;
         </li>
         <li>
          timer based lighting controls to some areas;
         </li>
         <li>
          replacing incandescent lamps with compact fluorescents (more energy efficient) in Public and circulation areas; and
         </li>
         <li>
          waste heat recovery from computer rooms for swimming pool heating.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         Further energy saving initiatives being developed include:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          replacement of the low-load chiller with more energy efficient equipment;
         </li>
         <li>
          installation of energy efficient lights in offices and carparks;
         </li>
         <li>
          energy efficient lighting design incorporated into all new construction work;
         </li>
         <li>
          removal of instant boiling water units from some suites and offices; and
         </li>
         <li>
          assessing the feasibility of implementing tri-generation and solar power systems at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
           Parliament House
          </a>
          .
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department of Parliamentary Services has implemented a number of water saving initiatives to date including:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          annual flower displays discontinued;
         </li>
         <li>
          overall irrigation restrictions based on condition monitoring of soil moisture levels;
         </li>
         <li>
          irrigation of nine hectares of gardens and lawns stopped, and watering of the Senate playing field, ramps, courtyards and formal gardens reduced;
         </li>
         <li>
          turning off 20 external water features in and around Parliament House;
         </li>
         <li>
          use of recycled water in the forecourt water feature;
         </li>
         <li>
          40kL storm water capture tank installed for overflow of forecourt water feature;
         </li>
         <li>
          water restriction shower heads installed in all bathrooms and change rooms showers; and
         </li>
         <li>
          increase of air-conditioning temperature set point in public and general circulation areas (less water consumed by the cooling tower).
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         Further water saving initiatives in progress include:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          trials of drought resistant couch grass that requires no water in winter;
         </li>
         <li>
          installation of low flow urinals in the male public toilets;
         </li>
         <li>
          installation of dual flush toilets and sensor activated water taps in all public toilets; and
         </li>
         <li>
          plans to undertake further projects using local rainwater collection.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         These measures have resulted in the following water savings achievements:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          water consumption in 2008-09 was the second lowest on record since the building was opened in 1988;
         </li>
         <li>
          water consumption during 2007-08 and 2008-09 was reduced by 49% and 38% respectively from that during 2006-07; and
         </li>
         <li>
          water consumption during 2008-09 was 10% less than the
