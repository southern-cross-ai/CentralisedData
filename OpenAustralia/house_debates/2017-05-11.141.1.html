        Last Sunday, 7 May, I attended the presentation day for the East Hills Baseball Club at Panania Diggers. It was fantastic to be there and to see all the great achievements of the club in the most recent season. East Hills Baseball Club has been around since 1965 and has had players represent at the state, national and indeed international level and players who have played in the major league in the United States. It is the strongest baseball club in the Bankstown region, and there is clearly a great sense of camaraderie and spirit in the club. Many of the volunteers who make the club run have been doing so for literally decades. I would like to thank the club for their hospitality on the day and congratulate

        and the whole committee on the success of the 2016-17 season.

        On 15 April I attended the Easter Eggstravaganza event, which was a great day of family entertainment, hosted by three churches in the Padstow area: iShine, Lifegate and St John's Anglican church. The 'eggstravaganza' was held in Playford Park in Padstow, as it was last year. There were a wide range of food stalls, live performances and entertainment from the church community. The highlight of the day was the Easter egg hunt, where apparently 10,000 eggs were found. That is clearly a lot of eggs! The night finished with a screening of the family-favourite movie
        <i>
         Finding Dory
        </i>
        on the big screen. It really was a tremendous event, so thank you to Pastor Paul Jabez from iShine, to

        from Lifegate at Padstow for everything he does—not only for the Easter Eggstravaganza but for the community more generally—and to Reverend Richard Blight from St John's Anglican at Padstow.

        On 24 April I attended the Revesby Probus club meeting. It is a very strong and active Probus club in our area, with more than 100 active members. It was good to draw the raffle on the day and to chat with members about the activities of the club. I would like to thank

        from Revesby Probus for inviting me along on the day. I look forward to meeting with the group again in the future.

        Earlier in April I attended the Happy Singing Group in Hurstville. They are a longstanding entertainment group in our area, and it was great to be there for their performance, which consisted of a whole range of Chinese and Western songs. Thank you to Karen Ni for inviting me along, to the kids who performed and the adults who performed. There are some very strong singers in the Happy Singing Group. They are a great part of our community, and I look forward to visiting the Happy Singing Group again in the future.
