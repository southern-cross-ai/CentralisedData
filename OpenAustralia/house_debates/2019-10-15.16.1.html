        I commend the last speaker for his contribution. Last week I had the opportunity to attend a function hosted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        of Iraqi Organisations in Australia to raise awareness about the civil unrest currently occurring in Iraq. For a country that has been ravaged by war and destruction, the current situation in Iraq is extremely regrettable. We have a country which, two years after the defeat of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS" rel="nofollow">
         ISIS
        </a>
        , is still grappling with uncertainty and worsening living conditions despite Iraq's significant wealth and ability to freely trade probably for the first extended period since 1970. Iraqi people are faced with damaged and deteriorating infrastructure and are particularly, in fact, impacted by entrenched and widespread corruption.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mass protests have erupted in Iraq over the inadequacies of state services and the lack of jobs and employment opportunities, with over 100 people killed and thousands injured as a result of excessive force being used by security forces. Clearly, those responsible must be held to account. The situation in Iraq remains extremely concerning, with protesters unable to voice their concerns in a peaceful, democratic manner while the authorities are deploying excessive force. I call on the Iraqi government to cease its use of violence against peaceful demonstrators and bring justice to those responsible for these gross human rights abuses.
