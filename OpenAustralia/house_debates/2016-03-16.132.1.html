        It is unlikely that in Tasmania any time soon we will have a major naval base or an Army training facility of any substance. However, the way that Tasmania can be innovative and attract defence spending was highlighted last week when I had the Minister for Defence, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marise_Payne" rel="nofollow">

        , in my electorate—of all places at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaglehawk_Neck" rel="nofollow">
         Eaglehawk Neck
        </a>
        on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Tasman Peninsula
        </a>
        . She was there to announce $4 million of funding for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Atmosphere" rel="nofollow">
         One Atmosphere
        </a>
        's Pegasus aircraft buoyancy system, which was developed by One Atmosphere, in particular a local lad Tim Lyons, born and raised in Murdunna on the Tasman Peninsula. The facility that has been created at Eaglehawk Neck will be the innovation hub for developing buoyancy systems to be used in the Tiger armed reconnaissance helicopter, initially in the armed forces but also the applications that apply within the oil and gas sector—Deputy Speaker Price, of interest to yourself of course—as well as in search and rescue operations. This is truly innovative. I also congratulate my colleague the member for Bass for the hard work that he has done over many years and for the success that he has had at the defence food facility at Scottsdale in north-east Tasmania in attracting the funding to develop ration packs.

        Last week, was a very significant week for Tasmania with defence funding coming in. This is how our state can participate and get a greater share of defence funding by being smart and by being innovative. With the support of the defence department, this was a commitment that we gave on coming to government; that we would make it easier for small and medium enterprises to participate in defence procurement, and so it is. It was wonderful to see those two announcements last week. This is the sort of collaboration that will create jobs and ongoing employment opportunities and manufacturing industries in our state.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst the innovation is occurring in my electorate on the Tasman Peninsula at Eaglehawk Neck, the manufacturing of these buoyancy systems for defence and other applications in the civil areas will be undertaken in Hobart. This exactly the sort of thing that Tasmania can do if we are smart and use the innovative people that reside in our state.
