       <p>
        Last year when the Tonganah sawmill in Scottsdale in north-east Tasmania closed down, this government stood ready to respond—not in a way which would simply brush issues such as sustainability under the carpet, to be dealt with some time in the future, but rather in a manner which aims to support investment, generate employment and create a sustainable and vibrant region. With that in mind, Senator Kim Carr and I announced the creation of and substantial funding for the North East Tasmania Development Package. This was a joint initiative of the Australian and Tasmanian governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        This package included the North East Tasmanian Innovation and Investment Fund—$3.7 million to support investment specifically aimed at generating sustainable new jobs. Key to its success and integral to the future of the region was the co-contribution component of this fund. For applicants to be successful they needed to be prepared and able to commit their own money to the projects proposed. And commit they did. The co-contribution to the federal government investment of $3.7 million was $3.3 million. This is an impressive sign of confidence in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Friday I announced that there were 19 successful applications to the North East Tasmanian Innovation and Investment Fund. They came from a diverse cross-section of industry and have the ability to create 63.5 full-time jobs—sustainable, long-term employment. I announced the successful applicants at Woodlea Nursery, one of the successful businesses. The nursery’s owners, Doctors Tony and Anna Waites, run a specialist wholesale nursery which produces over seven million seedlings per year for a number of local forestry businesses. It is the only independent, accredited nursery for the Tasmanian wine sector and supplies around 30 vineyards. These are the stories that I am really proud to be able to tell. This young couple took over this nursery in 2007 after moving from Melbourne. They have invested heavily in the region and they have backed the region. As part of the grant there are three main areas of activity, providing enhanced and upgraded infrastructure to increase production of forestry seedlings and enabling the pursuit of large-scale plant contracts with major garden centres throughout Tasmania and interstate. This is one example of the kind of commitment which exists in the north-east of Tasmania.

        Also successful were: Allan Barnett Motor Yachts, funded to upgrade their equipment and factory to cater for manufacturing larger vessels; Anchor Organics, whose project is the north-east red soil boutique potato project;

        As you can see, these are a diverse range of businesses which stand to benefit from this funding. It was an exhaustive application process. There were some 60 applications—a high number which I believe also signals that there is much confidence in the future among businesses in the north-east of Tasmania, particularly in these hard global economic times. The applications were assessed by a panel of three, which included representatives from both the Tasmanian and Australian governments as well as a community representative. That representative was

        and I would like to thank him for the commitment he made and his contribution to this process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout this period I have said often that we do not want to be going through this again in 18 months time or, for that matter, in two years time. I am hopeful that we have set in train the development of sustainable jobs which will in turn lead to a sustainable region. The north-east of Tasmania is a vibrant and wonderful place. It is a region which, yes, has suffered its share of setbacks and which, like the rest of the country, is not immune to the effects of the global financial crisis. Through the North East Tasmanian Innovation and Investment Fund, we are investing to create more than 63 jobs, and we are witnessing what happens when businesses across a community are given the opportunity to invest in themselves and in their region.
