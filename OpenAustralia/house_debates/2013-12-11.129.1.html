        On 27 October this year I had the privilege of joining members of the New South Wales Vietnamese Elderly Friendship Association to celebrate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandparents_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Grandparents Day
        </a>
        â€”a significant event to recognise the role and the contribution that senior citizens make in our community. Since the inception of this association in 1993, it has come from very humble beginnings, to now being a remarkable and prominent organisation in my community, consisting of over 2,000 members. I have had the opportunity of working very closely with Mieng Van Nguyen, president of the association, and his committee over the past four years. I have witnessed firsthand the many great things that this association has achieved in assisting, as well as advocating and providing for, the needs of elderly Vietnamese Australians in our community. The association's welfare and social support services, which include monthly meeting gatherings, organised tour trips and free shuttle bus services, have positively contributed to the mental and physical wellbeing of many senior citizens in my community. As my electorate comprises more than 20 per cent of Vietnamese descendants, I feel extremely privileged to have these services operating in my local community. Throughout the years I have had the opportunity of attending a number of gatherings, organised by this association, and I remain truly touched by the spirit of friendship and general zest for life its members bring to the forefront of the ageing population. Although its members have resided in Australia for over the last 20 years, they have never ever parted with their traditional Vietnamese cultures or traditions. This is reflected in the vibrant and the colourful traditional Vietnamese dress,

        , performances, spectacular live entertainment and amazing hospitality that never fails to impress at any of these association's gatherings. Clearly this association is a true role model for other organisations seeking to cater for the needs of the elderly in a unique cultural setting by giving people the respect and dignity they deserve and, more importantly, allowing them to realise the ongoing influence and social contribution that senior citizens make in a modern society. As the association approaches the remarkable milestone of 20 years of service to my local community and on this particular anniversary, the 20th anniversary, I take the opportunity to congratulate them and all the good work that their leadership undertake on behalf of the community. I look forward to continuing to have a very long and valued relationship with Mieng Nguyen and his executive committee.
