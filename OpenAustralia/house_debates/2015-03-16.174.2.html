        I rise to congratulate New South Wales Labor for their commitment to invest in a major redevelopment of the Tweed Hospital. It was announced on 6 March that a Foley Labor government will invest $211 million for the long overdue redevelopment of the Tweed Hospitalâ€”without the need to privatise the electricity network. Labor's $211 million funding will deliver stage one, two and three of the development and will include upgrades to the emergency department; enhancement of specialist units and ward expansions with up to 140 extra beds; up to 22 extra beds in the renal dialysis ward; and expansions to clinical services, such as the intensive care unit, cancer clinic, operating theatres, special care nursery, stroke unit, medical imaging and pharmacy. This is in stark contrast to the Nationals, who have reluctantly promised $48 million to the hospital, and that $48 million of course comes from their plan to privatise the electricity network, which we know will drive up prices.
       </p>

        Tweed Hospital is one of the state's busiest hospitals. Last year, more than 47,000 people attended the emergency department at the hospital. That number will continue to grow over the coming years and the hospital will need the space and resources to respond to that. So I was very pleased to hear that New South Wales Labor understands, listens and is responding to these concerns with its wonderful commitment of $211 million for the three-stage redevelopment of Tweed Hospital. This is much-needed in our local area, as the hospital is currently in a state of crisis and it needs an injection of funding like that promised by New South Wales Labor.
