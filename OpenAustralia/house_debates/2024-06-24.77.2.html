        My question is to the Prime Minister. How is the Albanese Labor government working to fight inflation and provide cost-of-living relief? What has the government ruled out?

         I thank my friend the member for Macquarie for her fantastic question and I thank her for the work she does representing her community that is very much a diverse community. It cares very much about the environment and has seen first-hand the devastating impact natural disasters can have. Whether it be bushfires or floods, the communities of Macquarie have had both during her time in service.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one week, on 1 July, this government will deliver relief for Australians because cost of living is our No. 1 priority. Firstly, we will deliver tax cuts for every single Australian taxpayer—not just some—then $300 in power bill relief for every household—not just some—and $325 for small business. We will extend the freeze on the cost of PBS medicines, where we have decreased costs from $42.50 down to $30, where we introduced 60-day scripts, all of which have made enormous difference.
        </p>
        <p>
         But importantly, there will be a pay rise in one week's time for 2.6 million workers on award wages. We want people to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. In addition to that, an extra two weeks of government funded paid parental leave will be delivered. This is not the beginning of our cost-of-living help and it is not the end. It builds on the relief we provided in our first two years: cheaper child care and energy bill relief, which knocked off three-quarters of a percentage point off inflation. Cheaper medicines have already saved five million Australians more than $414 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today we announced new rules to make sure families are getting better prices at the supermarket. Our crackdown on supermarkets will mean they face fines of up to $10 million if they break the code of conduct, making sure that families and farmers get a fair go.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, while we're working hard to bring costs down and provide relief, the only policy those opposite are pitching is one guaranteed to drive up power bills—a nuclear plan that costs too much and takes too long, a plan for higher power bills for Australians and a plan to say to business: stop the investment and stop the roll out of renewables.
        </p>
        <p>
         The certainty that the business community have been crying out for will be ripped up by those opposite. The certainty they need to invest in the infrastructure that will make a difference in driving down emissions and driving down power bills. No wonder those opposite are hiding the costs; they simply have no answers.
