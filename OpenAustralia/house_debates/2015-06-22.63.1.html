       <p>
        I bring to the attention of the House today the progress of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        in Canning. I do this because I feel it is of vital importance to correct some of the untruths members opposite have been touting around my electorate. Under Labor, fewer than 2,000 premises in the Canning electorate had been connected to the NBN after four years and $6.4 billion in funding. Notwithstanding the fact that rollout maps used as a campaign tool by those opposite listed street upon street in Canning as being under NBN construction, there was absolutely no construction taking place at all. Those areas were never connected to the NBN under Labor. It was only after the coalition government took over that more than 16,500 premises in the electorate were connected to superfast broadband. That is almost 10 times the amount delivered by those opposite in less than half the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        With that said—and I am pleased to see the member for Perth in the chamber—the member for Perth was questioning the Minister for Communications about the rollout of the NBN in Armadale and Kelmscott. Not only are these two suburbs located some 30 kilometres outside of the member's electorate but they fall into the constituency for which I am the federal representative, not her. For the benefit of the member for Perth, residences in Armadale and Kelmscott are among 50,000 that were named in NBN Co's 18-month rollout plan in December of last year. While I appreciate the member for Perth was not in the federal parliament during the chaos of the Labor years, I would like to make it clear that, while she was busy indulging in illusions about the NBN her party could not deliver, we are actually getting on with the job of delivering to the people of the Canning electorate good, fast NBN.
