        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House and the Ryan electorate on the current situation in the Philippines following the recent typhoon? What is Australia’s humanitarian response?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. I am happy to update the Ryan electorate as well as the parliament.

          Typhoon Durian
         </a>
         —it is also known as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Reming" rel="nofollow">
          Typhoon Reming
         </a>
         —struck the east coast of the island of Luzon in the Philippines on Friday morning. We believe that over 400 people have been confirmed dead as a result of the typhoon. There are around 400 people missing. According to the Philippines Red Cross, the death toll could rise to around 1,000. Many villages have been buried by mudslides. In total, something like 800,000 people will be affected and 100,000 homes are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a situation like this, involving a near neighbouring country to Australia, it is appropriate that we respond. We have immediately set aside $1 million for humanitarian relief to be distributed through the Philippines Red Cross,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF" rel="nofollow">
          UNICEF
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNDP" rel="nofollow">
          UNDP
         </a>
         working in the affected areas. AusAID is working with a number of relief agencies on the ground to help address the issues of a coordination nature that may arise. At this stage, we do not know how much assistance will be needed. As I said, we have set aside $1 million, but it may be that there is more or less for us to do. We certainly have the capacity to provide considerably more assistance if there is a need to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our ambassador has conveyed Australia’s condolences to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Arroyo" rel="nofollow">
          President Arroyo
         </a>
         in relation to the typhoon and its impact. President Arroyo has in a speech publicly thanked Australia for the support we have given, as well as for the support we have given in the troubled southern part of the Philippines in Mindanao. As usual, Australia stands ready to provide humanitarian assistance to one of our neighbours. In a situation like this, when so many people in the Philippines are so grievously affected, it is the least that we could do.
