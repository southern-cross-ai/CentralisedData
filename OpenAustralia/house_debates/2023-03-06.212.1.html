        Summer and autumn in Barker is show season. It's one of my favourite times of the year. In fact, with over 25 shows across the electorate, we also have spring shows. It's just winter when we don't have shows. It's my favourite time of the year not because I am the first person to line up at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        for doughnuts or at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        for a sausage sizzle but because I get to take my electorate office on the road. Like I said, there are 25 or so shows across 12 months in my electorate. Recently I had the pleasure of being at the 126th Angaston Show. I was also, on the weekend, at the Mannum Show. The Mundulla Show was taking place at the same time, and my office was set up there. I'm looking forward, in coming weeks, to being at the Tanunda Show and the Lucindale South East Field Days. I'll have staff at the Mount Pleasant Show as well.

        Why are these mobile offices important? They're important because constituents can come right up to you, have a chat and talk about things that matter to them. Shows are important because they allow regional communities to showcase the best of what they have and they're about communities coming together. I want to give huge thanks and congratulations to the volunteers across all of the communities that deliver these shows, and I want to thank everyone for stopping and having a yarn to me about the things that matter to them. There's nothing more grassroots than a conversation with a constituent at a show.
