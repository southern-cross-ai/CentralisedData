       <p>
        I have a brief statement members will be interested in from the Chief Opposition Whip and member for Fowler,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Hayes
        </a>
        . He's asked me to update you, if that's okay. He's been in the building during the course of the week but, obviously, not in the House. I will read his statement to you, which he wanted me to do:
       </p>
       <p>
        'Following my collapse in the Federation Chamber, a serious medical condition has been identified and I will be undergoing heart surgery tomorrow. While I will take a little break, I look forward to returning to my duties early in the new year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm indeed indebted to Dr Mike Freelander and Dr David Gillespie for their immediate medical assistance and to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Plibersek" rel="nofollow">
         Tanya Plibersek
        </a>
        for staying with me throughout this frightening ordeal. I also need to thank the parliamentary staff who organised my highly coordinated exit from the building.
       </p>
       <p>
        I reiterate what I said three years ago about the incredible professionalism of paramedics and staff at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Canberra Hospital
        </a>
        . We are very fortunate to have people of this calibre serving in our public hospitals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bernadette and I appreciated the kind and comforting words of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and the many well wishes we've received from all sides of the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I wish you a happy and peaceful Christmas and pray that 2021 is a vastly better year for all.
       </p>

        <p>
         on indulgence—I'm sure the Leader of the Opposition would join with me in wishing the Chief Opposition Whip all the best for his surgery. We join him in his prayers for his healthy recovery and for those attending to his care in the weeks ahead, particularly in the course of the surgery. Of course, I know Bernadette and the rest of the family will be anxious but at the same time have great faith as well. We wish them all the best. We thank you for the opportunity to hear that message he sent today. That is exactly what we'd expect of the Chief Opposition Whip. He is a tremendously good bloke.

         <p>
          on indulgence—Mr Speaker, thank you for participating in that message. I have spoken pretty regularly with Chris and Bernadette. His reference three years ago to Royal
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
           Canberra Hospital
          </a>
          was, of course, due to him riding a motorbike to Canberra—something that Bernadette has discouraged very strongly for a long period of time! He ended up in emergency at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canberra_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Canberra Hospital
          </a>
          . He ended up there again, under different circumstances this time. But both times, as he has said, he has been very grateful for the care that we get.
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the things I say about public hospitals is that when
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Packer" rel="nofollow">
           Kerry Packer
          </a>
          had a heart attack he ended up in emergency at Royal Prince Alfred public hospital. We have a great system here in Australia, and we should be very proud of it. I wish Chris and Bernadette all the best for tomorrow's operation. I thank the Prime Minister for his generous and genuine words.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
           Chris Hayes
          </a>
          is very much liked by everyone in this building. He does not have an opponent, and sometimes our opponents are all over this place, of course, as we know. In politics, he is someone who is liked across the spectrum, and we all wish him well.
