        Madam Deputy Speaker, on the 90-second statements, I believe it would be wise for the government to allow standing order 43 to be suspended procedurally in order to allow this matter of the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 to be concluded. I have raised that with the minister on duty and with the Chief Government Whip, and I believe this matter is of great importance. There are very serious issues that need to be resolved. The Leader of the Opposition is moving a motion to allow a bill to be debated and considered that would solve the offshore processing crisis. For that to be closed down by 90-second statements through that procedural method the government should hang its head in shame. I wanted to ask the Leader of the House. I asked the next in charge and the Chief Government Whip and I was told that they would consider it, but that obviously did not happen in time to ensure that the Leader of the Opposition could conclude his remarks. With 15 minutes left on the clock the speeches from the seconder and the government could be taken and the matter could be considered.

         I was in the chamber with the Prime Minister some time ago when the Prime Minister indicated that at 2 pm we would be seeking to have the debate concluded on the private member's bill—the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012—moved by the member for Lyne that has been passed through this parliament with a second reading. We would have the concluding statements after that occurred. The Prime Minister also made a request, which
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         will confirm, that the Manager of Opposition Business consult with myself, as Leader of the House, around the process. I offered to do that and the Manager of Opposition Business said he had other things to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a fact that the Prime Minister has indicated a process. There have been discussions with the crossbenchers. Everyone would be aware that at the meeting in this parliament today, as met on Monday, convened by the Independents, was a discussion between backbenchers of the government, the opposition and the Independents.

          I have no wish for the parliament on a day such as this to be needlessly inflamed. I have no wish on a day such as this for a whole lot of unnecessary procedural argy-bargy to be taking place between the government and the opposition. A motion to suspend standing orders has been moved by me to provide the parliament with a way forward through these very difficult circumstances. We now witness a certain disagreement between the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business. I respectfully suggest to members opposite that the 90-second statements period not now proceed, that our suspension be dealt with and then that which the government is proposing to do at two o'clock take place. That way each side gets a fair go.
