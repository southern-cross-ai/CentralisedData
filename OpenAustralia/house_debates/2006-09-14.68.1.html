        My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House of how security has been upgraded at Australian airports? Also, Minister, would you explain how effective these measures will be?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for Bass for the question and acknowledge his keen interest in helping to secure the safety of passengers in our airline system. The Australian government has spent $1.2 billion on upgrading security at our airports and in our aviation industry over recent times. The industry and airports themselves have also made a significant contribution. We have issued 100,000 aviation security identification cards; we screen all passengers and their carry-on luggage going onto jet aircraft; there is improved physical security at city and country airports; air security officers are on selected flights; there are hardened cockpit doors on all passenger aircraft with 30 seats or more; and we have dedicated airport police commanders and a strengthened police presence at our major airports. Those are examples of some of the initiatives that have been taken that are making a difference. I was interested to read a survey which demonstrated that the Australian public has a high degree of confidence in the security measures that we are putting in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why I think it is especially disappointing that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Brisbane seek to undermine public confidence in our security system by making dishonest, irresponsible and reckless claims about what happens in relation to airport security in Australia. As an example, the Leader of the Opposition has repeatedly claimed that international baggage is not subject to X-ray screening. The member for Brisbane has said it on occasions, although I note he has not said it in recent times because he knows the statement is wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has been told time and time again that all international baggage is screened—100 per cent. It has been the law since the end of December 2004. Yet, on 4 September, the Leader of the Opposition put out a press statement in which he said that baggage is not all checked. He said it in a doorstop interview outside
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         on the same day. Earlier this week, he went even further. On 2UE he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ... ensuring all baggage, particularly overseas baggage, is X-rayed, and not all of it is.
        </p>
        <p>
         He went further and said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Only about 10 per cent of it’s checked.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is simply wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has been told time and time again that 100 per cent of it is X-rayed. He has been told that at this dispatch box. He is not listening now; he will probably go outside again and make the same inaccurate statement. The reality is that it is not 10 per cent checked; it is 100 per cent checked. It is time that he was honest about it. The member for Brisbane comes in here—

             Now that the Leader of the Opposition is clearly listening, let me tell him one more time: 100 per cent of international baggage is X-rayed, not 10 per cent as he said a couple of days ago. Don’t say it incorrectly again. The member for Brisbane goes on about doors at Sydney airport, and gates at Dubbo and Ballina. Each time, the council has come back categorically and demonstrated to him where he was wrong in what he said.

                I have been going through some of the reckless and irresponsible claims made by the member for Brisbane about airport security. Finally, I refer to his comments on
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill" rel="nofollow">
                 Broken Hill
                </a>
                radio this week, when he said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                People who have travelled in jets know that cockpit doors are hardened. That’s not so with those propeller-driven aircraft.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wrong again! This government has funded a program to ensure that all of those cockpit doors are indeed hardened. Once again, the member for Brisbane has invoked the wrath of a council about his irresponsible statements. This time it is the Broken Hill City Council.

                   City Council said that for the member for Brisbane to make statements like these is irresponsible and a case of political point-scoring. Kennedy says, ‘If a terrorist does take over a flight from Broken Hill the finger will be pointed at Bevis.’ I think the reality is that it is high time the opposition were responsible in dealing with these issues. We have acted constructively to improve airport security. They should recognise the improvements that have been made and not seek to undermine them with reckless and irresponsible claims.
