           The Leader of the House will resume his seat for a second. I've made very clear my need to hear the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business. Members

            interjecting
           </a>
           wildly make that an impossible task. I've said this on a number of occasions. I'm now saying to the House: don't expect to be warned and don't expect to be thrown out under 94(a) if you interject. Members who have a track record in this regard can expect more severe penalties. I want to hear the point of order from the Leader of the House because I presume that the Manager of Opposition Business actually wants me to consider his question.

           <p>
            Thank you, Mr Speaker. Under the standing orders in the
            <i>
             House of Representatives P
            </i>
            <i>

            , the sub judice convention on page 562 says:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Questions should not raise matters awaiting or under adjudication in a court of law. In such cases the House imposes a restriction upon itself to avoid setting itself up as an alternative forum to the courts and to ensure that its proceedings are not permitted to interfere with the course of justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday, Mr Speaker, you had not yet written to the High Court referring the member for New England to the High Court for adjudication. Today, as I understand it, you have written to the High Court. Therefore, I believe that question, which asks a very specific question about the status of the member for New England, is now subject to the sub judice rule, and, therefore, should not be allowed to be asked.

             Members will not interject.

              The Manager
             </a>
             of Opposition Business will resume his seat. I thank the Leader of the House for his point of order. It won't surprise members that I've reflected on this matter for the last 24 hours and 40 minutes, since the beginning of question time yesterday. The Leader of the House quite rightly points out that the House has adopted certain practices in the past, and everything he read there was accurate. Members should also be aware that there are certain exceptions to this and the way the House has gone about things—for instance, with respect to a criminal matter where a jury is involved, with respect to what stage the case is at. I've considered this very closely.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the first week I became Speaker, I said I wanted free-flowing debate, and my attitude as Speaker is that with the High Court—the highest court in the land—adjudicating on these matters, with the deepest respect to every member of this House, myself included, I am very confident the High Court is not going to be swayed one way or the other by what is said in this House. I say that with respect to everyone who has given an opinion, including that last interjector, the member for Isaacs, who has been warned and will now leave under 94(a).

             No, I will retract that—I've just been reminded it was a 'hear, hear'. I thought it was something else! All interjections are disorderly, but if it was a 'hear, hear', that's less disorderly than the others. So I'm going to allow the question. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.

              It seems that the decision to not have me speak lasted 24 hours! Over the course of the weekend, we went through the process of renunciation. We received verbal communication from
