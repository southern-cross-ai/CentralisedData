       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge and remember the incredible life of local cricket legend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McMahon" rel="nofollow">
         John McMahon
        </a>
        . John recently passed away at the age of 91. Playing his first game of cricket at the age of nine in 1943, John continued playing until 2011, and he retired at the age of 79. He joined the Lismore Marist Brothers cricket team, and through his career there he took five wickets on more than 75 occasions and would go on with a number of other teams to take a total number of 120 five-wicket hauls across his career. Upon being selected for the northern

        team, one of John's most satisfying achievements was playing against both the English and

        touring teams.
       </p>
       <p>
        After making a return to cricket at the age of 58 to help the struggling Wardell club in 1990, John took 130 wickets over the following four seasons. From serving as a regional director of coaching for the far north coast to being the personal coach in 1992 of

        , the Australian women's cricket team captain, John continued to prove his coaching ability off the field. Some of his most honoured achievements include being named Lismore Cricketer of the Year, earning two

        and receiving an Order of Australia medal in 2008.

       <p>
        I would like to express my condolences to Joan and the McMahon family, including John's children, Brian, Michael, Terry, Kathryn, Patricia, Judith, Maureen and Paul and their families. May he rest in peace.
