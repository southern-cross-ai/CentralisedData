        I rise today to acknowledge the great work that is occurring at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Hilary" rel="nofollow">
         St Hilary
        </a>
        parish, led by Father Peter Simmons and Anglicare, in setting up a new emergency assistance site, called the Food Barn, at the old courthouse in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphett_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Morphett Vale
        </a>
        . I was pleased to be able to attend the opening of this new service in the south that is there to help many people in the local community. It has been set up by a number of dedicated volunteers and staff who have made a commitment to help those most vulnerable in our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Food Barn has been set up in a supermarket style with food and other basic products, including blankets and nappies, that have been donated by the local community. Families in need can come into the Food Barn and select the products that they are in most desperate need of. This approach ensures that, although the families may be desperate and vulnerable, they are still able to feel empowered to select the products they may need. There has been significant demand for the emergency food and grocery items at the Food Barn, and even though its doors have only been open for a couple of months there has been great community interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        The services at the Food Barn are clearly needed, with volunteers already assessing up to 16 needy client and families per day. The parish community is not only relying on canned food and donations but is also starting a veggie garden out the back to provide clients with fresh food items which in todayâ€™s society are getting quite expensive but which are needed by the local community. This garden will also be tended by a great number of volunteers who will give their time to grow food for those most in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vision that the local community has for the Food Barn is greater, though, than just providing emergency groceries. From this week onwards emergency counselling will be available to help those who are struggling and need support. Counsellors will be available to lend a sympathetic ear.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the Food Barn for providing this extra service because, for many families or people in crisis, the problems they have seem insurmountable and talking to someone will help these clients to resolve their problems. In addition, in the future, the Food Barn will also provide community cooking groups which will provide families and individuals with assistance in nutrition and menu planning.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have said, the Food Barn is staffed by dedicated volunteers who help in all areas of the barn, including tending the garden and providing tutoring and assistance. I would like to congratulate all those who have contributed.
