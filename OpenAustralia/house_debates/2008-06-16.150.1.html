        I call on the government to reverse its decision to reject the Bunbury and Districts Hockey Association’s application for Regional Partnerships funding. The association comprises regional teams from throughout the south-west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and has a proud history of producing state and national quality players and teams. The existing turf grounds are in very poor condition, with one ground at least seven years beyond its use-by date. Replacing each ground will cost $1 million. To attract and retain a senior competition, the association has no choice but to develop one of these fields. The project was scoped, costed and sponsored, funding partners were organised and construction had to occur over summer for the 2008 season.
       </p>

        Funding was to include $320,000 from Regional Partnerships. Advice received was that the funding was certain and, as a result, tenders were called because of time constraints. The Labor government’s decision to subsequently deny funding means that the Bunbury and Districts Hockey Association now has to take out a loan for $400,000, in addition to its original contribution in cash and kind. That means a total $600,000 contribution by a voluntary community organisation. The financial burden is having a significant adverse effect on attracting volunteers and players. From meeting club representatives I know it has already had a major impact on the dedicated group of volunteers who have already put so much time, physical effort and personal funds into this project. This is the effect of abolishing the Regional Partnerships program in my electorate. There are major regional, social and health benefits to this project. I call on the government to reverse its decision and fund the club.
