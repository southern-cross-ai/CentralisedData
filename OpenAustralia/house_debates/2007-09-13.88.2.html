        As members would be aware, one of our longest serving staff members, Brian Walshe, is retiring after 27 years. Brian is known by most around here as the guru or the grandfather of chamber attendants and as a perfect gentleman. Brian commenced work at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Parliament House
        </a>
        in 1980 and then moved to the new Parliament House in 1988. Brian retired from full-time employment with the parliament in 1999 but has continued as a part-time attendant since that time. As a messengerial attendant, Brian has undertaken the full gamut of attendant tasks as well as supervising the operation of the chamber and has done so very successfully.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brian will be missed greatly by all and he will finish with us at the end of the parliament. Thank you, Brian, you will be greatly missed. On behalf of all members, I wish you, your wife, Joan, and your family, who are in the gallery, all the best.

         As somebody who has been in the parliament for the entire time that Brian has, commencing in the old House in 1974, I warmly endorse everything that you have said, Mr Speaker. Brian Walshe is an exemplar of politeness and civility. He is very courteous; he is helpful. He always makes you feel that nothing is a problem in assisting you, and I really do admire him as an example of those thoroughly decent men and women who help to make this place work. They do their job no matter what the circumstances. They are polite to both sides of the House, whatever their own personal views may be, and I cannot endorse more strongly how much I have enjoyed working with Brian and how I have admired his gentlemanly nature. He is a reminder to all of us that manners still count in the modern age and declining levels of civility are to be abhorred. He is a gentle reminder of an approach to life that is just so courteous and friendly and polite that we should treasure it. I send to him and his family my very warm good wishes for his retirement.

          Mr Speaker, I join with what you and the Prime Minister have said about Brian Walshe. In the period that I have been in this place, his friendship, courtesy, civility and just plain helpfulness with assisting members and others around this building is without parallel. On behalf of members of the parliamentary Labor Party, Brian, you are going to be very much missed in this place. You are regarded on our side of the House and, I am sure, by government members as someone who will never ever say that any request we put is too hard or difficult to manage. You have always been exceptionally kind in your response to such requests. Leaving aside your own problems in being a Collingwood supporter, we join with the Prime Minister in wishing you and your family all the best in your retirement.
