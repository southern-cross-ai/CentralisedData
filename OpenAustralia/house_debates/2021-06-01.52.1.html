        My question is to the Minister for Health and Aged Care. Can the minister confirm that Senate estimates has today revealed that 12,873 aged-care residents in Victoria are still waiting for their second dose? Why then did the minister tell
        <i>
         7.30
        </i>
        last Thursday that the vaccination of Victorian aged-care facilities was '99 per cent completed' and would be '100 per cent tomorrow'?

         Indeed, that is exactly right with regard to 100 per cent of Victorian Commonwealth aged-care facilities, on the advice that I have, and reaffirmed this morning, being completed by Friday of last week for first doses. That was always the reference, and I am certain that the member is well aware of that. More generally around Australia, what we've seen at this point in time is that across four states and territories 100 per cent of facilities have been completed with first doses. They are Victoria, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         and Tasmania. Remaining facilities are to be done over the coming days. The advice that I give is that, as of last night, there were 20 to be completed.
        </p>
        <p>
         I did make an error yesterday—my mistake, my apologies—nobody else's fault but mine. The department's advice was correct. My misreading of it was my fault. In fact, by close of business tomorrow, on the advice that I received just before coming to this facility, we will be down to five. I was expecting that was six. Having said that, 100 per cent of facilities in four states and territories, as part of a broader national rollout, which at this point in time has seen 272,000 vaccinations of aged-care residents around the country, and that has provided a very significant measure of protection. I would note that, for example, in Arcare Maidstone, a 99-year-old resident who was diagnosed as positive, albeit asymptomatic, has been placed in a dedicated COVID ward in hospital for observation has been vaccinated. That will provide protection. Of course, there is no guarantee in any case, but that is a very important measure of protection. That clarifies exactly what I said last week. Indeed, those figures which were provided to
         <i>

         were correct.
