        No doubt everyone here will know that raising a child requires constant love, support and sometimes much patience. But please, take a moment to consider raising a child with autism. Think about the added complexities that brings to life. My grandson, Nathaniel, is on the autism spectrum, so I know firsthand that raising a child with a disability such as autism can bring many, many challenges to their family. But there is also this special type of love which is a joy in itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        I represent a region which has significant disadvantage. One of the complications is that 52 per cent of all families in

        that live with autism live within a 20-kilometre radius of the Liverpool Central Business District. There is a great need to support families living with autism in my community. Therefore, and because of my own family's experience with autism, I continue to advocate—both in and outside this parliament—for greater support for those who work to support families living with autism.

        Last Sunday, together with the member for Hughes, I attended the 7th annual Foundation of Hope charity ball, hosted by the Autism Advisory and Support Service. This is a charity event that raises necessary funds to support families and children with autism. I have spoken about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AASS" rel="nofollow">
         AASS
        </a>
        on many, many occasions in this place. It is a not-for-profit organisation which has dedicated an enormous amount of effort and time in caring for and supporting children with autism and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Headed by Grace Fava, who is the founder and President of AASS. This organisation has really taken on a very proactive role in raising awareness. But more than that, advocating on behalf of sufferers and the families of children with autism. Grace herself has two sons on the spectrum but, nevertheless, she is able to put in an enormous amount of time in educating, communicating and, importantly, going about all those things supporting families after their child has been diagnosed with autism. She personally believes that children with a disability have the right to participate as fully as possible in our community and enjoy the same opportunities and experiences of other children. It certainly takes a special kind of dedication and commitment to be so giving to a community in need. AASS truly makes a great difference in the lives of many in my community, and this is an organisation that is worthy of our general support.
