       <p>
        On Australia Day this year two outstanding Shortland residents were awarded the Order of Australia: Edward or Ted Atchison as he is known and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Storer" rel="nofollow">
         William Storer
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Ted Atchison is an outstanding citizen, who lives in Charlestown and who has been very active over many years in service groups and the sporting community. He is a very effective member of Rotary and is dedicated to community services. His contributions to sport in the Hunter are phenomenal.
       </p>
       <p>
        William is also a resident of Charlestown. He was awarded membership of the Order of Australia for his very significant services to the visual arts, especially for his hard work in the development of regional and community museums.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both these men have lobbied me on many occasions, fighting for organisations in the community, and both are highly regarded in the local community. Furthermore, both men have the qualities that epitomise why a person needs to be awarded membership of the Order of Australia. Congratulations. These are honours well earned.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate
