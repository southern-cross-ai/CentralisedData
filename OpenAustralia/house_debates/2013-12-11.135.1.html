       <p>
        I rise to congratulate Amy Duncan, an inspiring Labor legend, on the occasion of her 80th birthday. Amy was born in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Her life started around the time of apartheid and her fighting spirit was forged against a landscape of injustice in the heat of the civil rights movement. Amy trained as a nurse and she excelled in her career. Caring professions are often undervalued and I think it is very important that mention be made of the extraordinary work that Amy performed in that capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amy's concern about the welfare of others, especially the most vulnerable in our society, is complemented by her determination and rare ability to transform words into action. It is very easy to talk about the problems that society faces, but it takes rare conviction to do something about these problems and be part of the solution. Amy has this rare conviction. When Amy sees an injustice, or there is an issue she feels strongly about, she takes actionâ€”letters are written, petitions are signed, campaigns are organised and protests are arranged. Just a few weeks ago, Amy sat outside this building to demonstrate to members of parliament that she does not support the current asylum-seeker policy. We may not all agree with Amy's position, but I think we can all admire her excellent fighting spirit. At 80 years old, she travelled overnight on a bus to get here to share her view with the parliament, sitting next to strangers who would soon become her friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amy first became an activist in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">

        before circumstances made it necessary for her to flee with her two small children. It is at this time of Nelson Mandela's passing that we think about his struggle and his extraordinary contribution to make the world a better place. There were many who shared in the great struggle for social justice in South Africa. Amy was one of those remarkable people. Amy fought against apartheid at a time when the penalties were very grave, and she was arrested for her activism. Her husband's courage led to his own imprisonment. He was eventually released, and this prompted the difficult decision for Amy to leave her homeland for a safer place. After living for some time in a situation of uncertainty in Zimbabwe, Amy and her family were eventually granted political asylum in the United Kingdom. She quickly began organising campaigns in her new home against

        cuts to services, before moving to Australia and, lucky for us, settling in Hotham.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Hotham, Amy is well known. We are spoilt with a lively

        branch culture, genuine camaraderie and deep engagement with the party in Hotham. Much of that is thanks to Amy. At her recent birthday party, it was not surprising but still fantastic to see so many people sharing fond memories and sharing the joy of this occasion. She is a much cherished member of our community in Hotham and communities extending beyond the reach of my electorate. Amy's extraordinary tenacity and deep compassion are very inspiring to me and I am delighted to wish her many happy returns. Happy birthday, Amy.
