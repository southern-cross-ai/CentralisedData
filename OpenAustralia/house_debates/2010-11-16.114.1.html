        I raise three issues in the House this evening. The first relates to the need for a seniors citizens’ centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Rocks" rel="nofollow">
         South West Rocks
        </a>
        . The South West Rocks Seniors’ Association is one of the most active on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        . With more than 450 members, the club is renowned for its monthly lunches and regular activities. Around 58 per cent of the local community is over 55 years old. The association currently uses the South West Rocks School of Arts hall, but this is incompatible with their needs and precludes them from hosting activities, because of other demands on the hall. The association is negotiating with both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempsey_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Kempsey Shire Council
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government to secure public land on which a seniors’ centre could be constructed in South West Rocks.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the recent federal election campaign, the coalition committed $500,000 towards the construction of a senior citizens’ centre in South West Rocks. The centre is much needed by the community and would complement the recent opening of the South West Rocks aged care facility. I acknowledge the great work and long service that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_King" rel="nofollow">
         John King
        </a>
        has delivered for the seniors’ association in South West Rocks and call on the government to join the coalition in providing bipartisan support for this great local project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second matter I raise relates to the proposed Woolgoolga and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Beaches" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Beaches
        </a>
        multipurpose community facility. The Northern Beaches area, north of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        , continues to grow, as does the demand for improved services and infrastructure. Currently the area is lacking sporting and cultural facilities in which young people can participate in a range of activities. A Northern Beaches multipurpose community facility committee has been formed and comprises strong representation from the community and sporting groups. These include the youth club, the residents’ association, the chamber of commerce, the Indian Temple Committee, the Lions and Rotary clubs, the Woolgoolga High School P and C, the Woolgoolga Netball Association, soccer clubs and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Club. The committee proposes to construct an indoor community and sporting facility which would include basketball courts, a stage, a kitchen and multipurpose rooms. The centre would be a cultural venue for the arts and would provide a place to host community events.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vision is to bring the community together in one location and address the fact that many young people cannot access such facilities unless they travel to Coffs Harbour. A re-elected federal coalition government would have committed $800,000 towards the construction of such a facility. These funds were set aside to assist with construction costs. However, it was important that all three levels of government supported a multipurpose facility in Woolgoolga. I acknowledge the professionalism of the committee and call on the federal government to join the coalition in supporting this project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another important issue I raise relates to the future of the village of Wooli in the Cowper electorate. Wooli is a small coastal community of a few hundred people, and it is confronting the challenges of sand erosion. After years of erosion, many houses are potentially under threat. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Valley_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Valley Council
        </a>
        has released a draft plan of management which proposes a progressive retreat from the site of the original village. The plan tables the option of allowing landowners in the foreshore area to swap properties for crown land near the Wooli sportsground. This proposal is causing grief in the Wooli community. I recently met with Bruce Bird from the Wooli Chamber of Commerce and Margy Hewetson to discuss their concerns. They highlighted to me how important it is that every effort be made to protect these threatened properties and retain the current village precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the draft plan is implemented, all land south of the Wooli Bowling Club could be sacrificed. That includes the Wooli Public School. As the residents explained to me, there are other options available which could protect properties in the area, and I believe it is incumbent on the council to thoroughly investigate all options. The residents are concerned that the erosion problem will not receive adequate attention, given the small size of the Wooli village. I believe that Wooli residents deserve treatment equal to that of other ratepayers in the area, which is why I welcome the opportunity to place this matter on record in the federal parliament. Wooli is a beautiful village, and the land is very valuable. All reasonable efforts must be made to protect the village from erosion into the future.
