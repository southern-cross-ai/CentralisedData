       <p>
        I moved this motion to raise awareness about the significant impact that autism spectrum disorders have on the lives of individuals diagnosed with this condition as well as the lives of parents raising children with autism spectrum disorders and their families. A number of families in my local community in southern Adelaide have raised concerns with me about the challenges they face and, importantly, the need for support to be available for their children, particularly at key points. Among those key points are transition points in their lives, particularly the transition to school.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion notes the significant impact that autism spectrum disorders have on the lives of individuals diagnosed with this condition. This term, autism spectrum disorders, is an umbrella term for a pervasive developmental disorder such as autism or Asperger's syndrome. Individuals diagnosed with this can experience more or less severe behavioural abnormalities. Individuals diagnosed can often have difficulties with social interaction, communication and imaginative play. In terms of social interaction, children with autism can lack awareness of emotions experienced by others, can be unable to comprehend the consequences of their own behaviour and can prefer isolation to the company of others, presenting significant challenges for interacting with the world around them. In terms of communication, children with autism can experience delayed speech development, can develop unusual speech patterns to do with volume or speed and can develop unusual forms of communication, such as imitation. In terms of imaginative play, children with autism can often develop an intense preoccupation with a singular interest and become fixated on particular interests to the exclusion of all else. Children with autism can also have associated learning disabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Studies suggest that the prevalence of autism has been increasing, and I know that a number of families from my electorate are experiencing challenges. In some ways they would not change their children but what they are really talking about is that it is having an impact on them and they would like support in how to deal with this challenge.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion recognises the considerable challenges, as I said, and the need for support for a child with autism. The experience of raising a child can be, at times, trying. But most important is the need for support. Parents often experience and certainly have communicated to me a lot of anxiety about obtaining a diagnosis and whether or not they should. Some have tried over and over again without much success. However, that anxiety does not just stop if there is a diagnosis made because it can also create further anxiety about what it means for the future for the child who they love very dearly, what it will mean for the rest of their lives and what it will mean for their family.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to note that the research shows that a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can have a significant impact on the lives of parents who are constantly negotiating and often accommodating to protect their child from potential hazards or repeatedly demonstrating basic tasks such as how to blow one's nose. Children will also demonstrate severe tantrums. It is often said that attributes such as patience and persistence are required by all parents but they are, as many parents have made it clear to me, really required to a greater extent in parenting a child with autism.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of studies also point to a higher prevalence of mood disorders among parents with children with autism, such as depression and anxiety. Autism can also affect the relationships with relatives and the wider community as well as marital relationships. I have heard some very sad stories about marital breakdown as a result of the stresses that are placed on a family when looking after a child with autism. Certainly in my local electorate a lot of parents have felt very isolated about it. They do not really feel that parents of kids without autism understand what they are going through.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, there are emotional and financial pressures. Most parents I speak to want to give the very best opportunities to their kids, especially if they do suffer from autism, and get the right services in place. This can place a financial stress on the family. Parents have to also deal with perhaps brothers or sisters and manage those family relationships as well. It is difficult.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken to a lot of families in my electorate who are very concerned about this issue. One person I am going to speak about today is Coby Hudson of Hackham West. She is one of the many parents of children with autism in my local community. Coby has two boys aged eight and 10, both who are placed on the autism spectrum. Several years ago Coby started with a group which organises camps for families with children on the autism spectrum because when talking to other parents of children with autism she realised that they often felt so isolated, as I mentioned, that marriages were strained, that breakdown could particularly happen when people looked for someone to blame for a difficult situation and that families often had little positive time together because they were often working through the challenges presented. Coby found the camps created an important support network for families and siblings to talk with other people in the same situation. I must commend her very strongly for doing this because this is something that a lot of parents have indicated that they would really like.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was really important to be in an environment that is free of stigma. Often parents feel that there are a lot of prying eyes of those in the community who do not understand autism disorders. Coby is now looking forward to developing a new project called 'Absolutely Autism' to provide support for individuals with autism and their families. Her story is a very special story, because it indicates some very special work that she is doing. She has been concerned; she said that often she has people in the community labelling her child as naughty because they fail to understand some of the issues. There are a whole range of things that have affected her.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that autism spectrum disorders do have an impact. That is why I was so proud to be part of this government, that actually did implement a package for the first timeâ€”assistance for early intervention with autism. We do know that early intervention is critical in improving the cognitive, emotional and social development of children. The federal government did have the $220 million Helping Children with Autism package. Obviously, as I said, it ensures that we get in early and assist those parents. This package is quite important because it enables young children with autism to access up to $12,000 in funding for early intervention services, before the child's seventh birthday, as well as providing a range of other measuresâ€”access to autism advisers, family support and playgroups. I have spoken to a number of families who have really appreciated this support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would say, though, that a lot of parents have been concerned when that support is finished. In particular they notice a real drop-off in the transitional phase as children go to school, when they have been accessing the Helping Children with Autism package and then have to have the services at school. I have to say that a lot of parents have raised this transitional issue with me, that services are disjointedâ€”they are not seamlessâ€”and they certainly do not transition seamlessly from before school to at school.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that most parents would attest to the fact that with children getting older it does not get any easier. Certainly, ensuring that services continue to be provided is really important. That is why this motion does call on the Commonwealth, state and territory governments to work closely to ensure that there is a seamless provision of services to families with children with autism spectrum disorders, especially at key points of transition such as from early childhood to primary schooling and from secondary schooling to further education and training in the workforce. I think that if we are able to provide this support to families and this support to individuals then we can really help them to achieve everything that they can. I think that is so critically important.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to continuing to work in this parliament and also with the states and territories to ensure that the services that are provided really do help families in need.

        <p>
         Firstly, I would like to congratulate the member for Kingston for this private member's motion and her interest in this subject. Autism affects one in 100 Australians, and my son Trent is one of those one in 100. Everything this motion notesâ€”the significant impacts of the autism spectrum disorders include difficulties with normal social interaction, delayed speech and unusual forms of communication, intense preoccupation with a single particular interest, inability to comprehend the consequences of behaviour, lack of awareness about the emotions of others and associated learning disabilitiesâ€”are things that I and my wife, Vicki, have and continue to experience every day with our son Trent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trent was also born with Down syndrome, and the day that he was diagnosed was the worst day of my life. To be told that the hopes and dreams for your little boy are dashed leaves you with a great sense of guilt. But I was wrong: my dreams were not dashed, they were just modified. Trent is now 16 years old, and I have learnt some very valuable lessons in those 16 years. They have certainly been challenging years and they have certainly been a struggle for my wife and me. But, most of all I have learnt that every life is important; it is precious and it is valuable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like many parents who have their children diagnosed with autism it took quite a while for Trent, our son, to be correctly diagnosed. When he was about 18 months old we had concerns that he had a problem with his hearing, because he would not respond to noises as you would expect a normal child to do. For month after month we took him off to a hearing clinic, where they would put him in a darkened room and make noise with a puppet in one corner of the room, expecting Trent to turn, to recognise that his hearing was okay. But of course Trent would pay no attention so the hearing specialists thought he had hearing difficulties. We then went through months of trying to fit him with a hearing aid. The very minute we put it in his ear he would pull it out. This was a game we would play for hours and hours on end, and he would always win.
        </p>
        <p>
         One day we were over at my mother-in-law's place and his favourite
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         show,
         <i>
          Blue

         <i>

         </i>
         <i>
          s Clues
         </i>
         , came on. The very minute he heard it his little face turned to it. And I thought, 'You little bugger, you have been conning us all the time.' His hearing was okay, but he was autistic, which provided many of its own unique challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trent does not have any language, with the autism and the Down syndrome, but he certainly can let us know what he wants. He is a happy body. He laughs as much as any kid. He is satisfied and comfortable in the world he lives in that we created for him. He certainly gets frustrated from time to time but he can often get past that frustration after about 30 minutes of hard work. He does not have to worry about the next day, next week or next year. His world is uncluttered by the worries of responsibility, social acceptance and the subconscious fears that plague the rest of us.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now that he has reached the age of 16, it is time for him to start shaving. Every week I go through a procedure where we basically play jiu jitsu. I try to get the razor to his face and he tries to push it away. So we have shaving down to about 40 minutes from originally an hour and a half. One thing I have learnt is that every child with autism is different.
        </p>
        <p>
         While Australian statistics show that we have one in 100 children with autism, in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
          USA
         </a>
         those statistics are less, at one in 88. That is perhaps because they have mandatory assessment for all children. Perhaps we need to look at having mandatory assessment for all children before the age of four, before they reach school, so that they cannot slip through the net. We make sure that if these kids do need early intervention they actually get it. That gives them the best chance of having a solid foundation for their future.
        </p>
        <p>
         This motion also notes that the House recognises that raising a child with autism can present considerable challenges for families, including financial and emotional pressures as well as strains on the family unit and marital stress. Those I can attest to.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Autism Society of America estimates that the lifetime cost of caring for a child with autism is between $3.5 million and $5 million. But all the money in the world does not make dealing with autism easy. Many parents I know who have kids with autism are on medication for depression. The divorce rates are high and studies have shown that single mums of kids with autism have the same stress levels as soldiers in combat.
        </p>
        <p>
         One thing that I have been truly grateful for is to meet many other parents in a similar situation. One group in our local area is called the Autism Advisory and Support Service. This is a not-for-profit charity run by parents of children with autismâ€”they help. It is run by Grace Fava, Fiona Zammit, Bassema Ghaznavi, Korrine Miller and Tracey Diec. I am on the committee and I must apologise that I am unable to get to as many of their meetings as I would like to, because of parliamentary commitments. They run a range of services. They support, advocate, help to educate and guide families who have a member of their family with autism. They run a 24-hour hotline, all serviced by volunteers, so that parents from around the country can pick up that hotline and discuss, with a parent who understands the issues, the problems they have. I asked Grace Fava, who is a true champion for the cause of kids with autism, to help me make a few notes on a few other issues with the bill. One thing that she pointed out is that we should ensure that all therapists have a capped fee. The introduction of the HCWA package through FaHCSIA has seen a huge rise in fees for many of the therapists, which has seen the extra funding eaten away within months, with little or no progress made by the child. Although this funding was introduced to expose children to a wide range of therapies and interventions, there is simply no 'one size fits all' with autism.
        </p>
        <p>
         This motion also acknowledges support provided through the government's $220 million Helping Children with Autism package, which is the first national initiative to help families and children with autism. This was much needed and was a big step forward. However, as Grace notes, much of this money has been wasted on needless administration. If the funding were administered through Medicare, there would be less administration required and there could be no conflict of interest for autism advisers, who currently self-refer families with no other options. It would be more appealing to therapists, particularly those in regional and remote areas, to sign up. Currently there is a long waiting list in regional Australia and there is only one therapist serving many areas.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also asked Grace about the cut-off at four years of age, an issue that she raised with me. She is correct that autism does not magically disappear once the funding is finished. To ensure that every child has the same opportunity to fulfil their potential as their neurotypical peers, and to keep in line with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Disability Discrimination Act
         </a>
         , we must come together. I list these points: (1) agree that autism is an epidemic; (2) provide and maintain funding for therapies for as long as the child requires; (3) make provision for those children who are more severely affected, with suitable therapies, respite and accommodation that is age appropriate; (4) understand that individuals with autism are individuals first and foremost and they deserve respect, understanding and a society that will accommodate their needs; (5) provide education in settings that embrace the needs of those with autism and their comorbidities; and (6) provide effective training to teachers, therapists and medical professionals to understand and accommodate those needs. Any implementation of an

          NDIS
         </a>
         must ensure that the needs of all individuals with autism and Asperger's receive the support and funding they deserve. We must ensure that the needs of the vulnerable are placed above the profits and greed of several corporations.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the short time left, I would also like to take this opportunity to give special thanks to the children, carers and teachers at Bates Drive Public School, which looks after many children with autism. The teachers at that school deserve gold medals every single day. They truly do a wonderful job, as many of the other teachers do in our special needs schools throughout the nation. Again, I thank the member for Kingston for this motion. We have come a long way. We still have a long way to go together. Let us hope that we can work with both sides of this parliament coming together and making sure we can give our kids with autistic disorders exactly what they deserve and need.

         </small>
         <p>
          I start by thanking the member for Kingston for moving this very important motion. I also acknowledge the member for Hughes and thank him for his personal contribution and his personal story. I think those stories are very important when we are talking about issues such as autism. I rise to support the motion and note that the Australian government is firmly committed to improving the support and care for people with autism spectrum disorders and also for their families.
         </p>
         <p>
          Autism is sometimes referred to as an invisible disorder in that people with autism often do not have any observable signs, but they can have difficulty communicating or interacting socially, sometimes behaving inappropriately. Of course, many people who have autism are very intelligent, capable people and often behave very appropriately. It is because of a behavioural change that they tend to be unfairly labelled as naughty, bad or obnoxious when they do exhibit inappropriate behaviour. Instead, they should be recognised by onlookers as experiencing great difficulties in making sense of what is going on, and their outbursts of inappropriate behaviour are their way of expressing confusion, fear and frustration. We have heard many stories about the many challenges that children with autism have, whether that be in accessing school activities and some of the support services at school, and also many stories about the many challenges and difficulties that adults face. That is why it is so important that the government has committed to taking as much action as we can to provide that support and care. In 2007, the Australian Advisory Board on Autism Spectrum Disorders released a report on the prevalence of autism. The report indicated that around one child out of every 160 may display behaviours that would suggest that they may fall on the autism spectrum. The government understands the importance of early intervention services for children with autism.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government is improving access to those early intervention services during the most critical period of a child's development through the Helping Children with Autism package, which has provided over $220 million for services for children with autism. Since the commencement of the package in 2008, more than 19,000 eligible children have registered to access over 550,000 early intervention services in 1,300 locations across Australia. That is a very significant difference. The package supports and recognises the enormous challenges for children with autism, their families and carers. And there is a whole range of intervention measures in the package, such as the Autism Advisory and Support Services, early intervention funding, specific workshops for the information of parents and carers, lots of PlayConnect play groups and a website. There are Medicare items as well. There are also positive partnerships for the professional development of teachers and school staff who work with students with autism spectrum disorders. There really are a whole range of intervention processes.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition to the package, the government has established six autism-specific early learning and care centres, which provide specific early learning programs and support to children with autism or autism-like symptoms in a long day-care setting. So there are a whole range of very important interventions and support services available to parents and carers.
         </p>
         <p>
          As we know, the state and territory governments are the main providers of disability services in their respective jurisdictions. The package that I spoke about earlier is intended to complement state and territory government services by allowing families the choice of using their package funding on state and territory government services in ways that are most appropriate for the needs and requirements of their children. As I have explained, some of the government's commitment will continue to focus on supporting these children and their families in the early years. We will continue to do that as we move forward with the broader reforms underway with the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
         </p>

          A big focus of the National Disability Insurance Scheme will be on ensuring early intervention services are available to families when they most need them to help our children get the best possible start in life. We understand that. That is why the government has had such a very strong commitment to the National Disability Insurance Scheme and why we made a commitment in the budget to get that underway. We know that will be very important for families right across the country. We have taken that action for children, and particularly those with autism, because we understand that it is important for them to access those early intervention services. We also want to continue to provide support and counselling services for them and for their parents and their carers. We acknowledge many of the challenges that they face. We understand how important it is for us to continue to provide the ongoing support and education that they require.

           I rise in support of the member for Kingston's motion. I seek to point out a slight inaccuracy in it, though. The government's Helping Children with Autism package is a constructive initiative and one that should be supported. But it is not actually the first one. It is the second one. The first one was announced by the Howard government in 2007. That was a $190.7 million package to support children with autism spectrum disorder, their parents and their carers. I know that my friend and colleague the member for Gilmore and I and a number of other colleagues were extensively involved in that initiative. This represents a continuity of some good work in this space.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is important to recognise that there is a collaborative effort going on in this area. It is the sort of collaborative enterprise that is really needed to get the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           off the table. It is not an area that should be subject to politicking and point-scoring. It is an area in which there should be a great shared purpose right across this parliament, as it will take a number of terms of parliament and I suspect a number of governments of different hues to bring about the kinds of outcomes that people working with those with disabilitiesâ€”their families and their carers and the professionals who dedicate so much of their life to supporting this important group within our communityâ€”want. Collaborative enterpriseâ€”probably the biggest one we have needed for at least a decadeâ€”is what is needed, not trying to suggest one side of politics has a monopoly over it.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Howard government package was a good package. It did provide direct support for 15,000 families, including their carers and children, with funding assistance for early intervention servicesâ€”something that has been recognised by all speakers, as well as autism advisers operating across the continentâ€”to help steer people in the direction of the support that is needed. So often, as my friend and colleague
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
            Craig Kelly
           </a>
           and his wife Vicki have found, knowing where to turn and who can provide support can be one of the great mysteries. When you find someone who can help you find the path to the support that you need, that can be a great gift. That was a part of the package of the former Howard government, along with support for playgroups and assistance with the postdiagnosis phase and other children's services. So that was some good work that the government has built on.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 2008 I actually praised the government for moving beyond its original proposal of just six early intervention centres. This was never going to meet the task, because they would be located a long distance from a vast number of people needing to access that support service. I praised the government for picking up the bones of the Howard government program and going beyond its alternative commitment of just six early childhood centres. That was never going to go far enough. I think it was wise of the government to move beyond that original proposal.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are a couple of things worth looking at. The changes in the budget for the out-of-pocket medical expenses may not have been thought through quite to the degree that is needed. If we are going to support families with children with autism spectrum disorder, we need to recognise that a lot of their care is extraordinarily expensive, something that is touched on in this resolution. But that seems to have been missed in the changes to the out-of-pocket rebate arrangements. Originally $2,000 needed to be spent for a 20 per cent rebate. That is now under the government's budget a $5,000 outlay for only a 10 per cent return. When you look at the kind of care that is needed for a person with autism spectrum disorder and the arrangements that are in place for the support through the Medicare benefits schedule and the out-of-pocket expenses, this is going to create an enormous new additional expense for families. I am already receiving emails from my electorate saying, 'Have people not thought through the financial consequences of those needing quite a number of therapeutic sessions and assessment sessions, who are eligible to be supported by this out-of-pocket expense measure, which has now been wound back quite considerably?'
          </p>
          <p>
           In the minute that is left, I also want to point to the measure of Abacus at Monash Peninsula. I declare a pecuniary interest as the campus advisory council chairman. We have been working for years to bring together the expertise in the teaching area, the occupational therapy area, and the health and early intervention space to make sure the next generation of teaching professionals have with them the competencies to contend with special needs kids and kids that have successfully gone through an early intervention phase where they can be placed into mainstream schools. We have looked at a number of ways to pursue that. I will not go into all the details, only to say that the vacated childcare centre on the Monash campus has been leased to Windermere. This will provide specialist childcare support and a placement opportunity for the next generation of professionals to get direct research insight and hands-on experience and to improve our practice in relation to this crucial area of learning we need to continue to work on.

           <p>
            I would like to congratulate the member for Kingston for bringing this really important motion to the parliament. I know she is a woman that is committed to areas of disability and to helping people reach their potentialâ€”and that is what this motion is about. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the Labor government's $220 million Helping Children with Autism package has delivered to parents. It was like turning the light on. For years and years parents with children that had autism were scraping and trying to go from one service provider to another service provider, and they were never getting their needs fulfilled. It was only those parents that had the finances to be able to pay for those services out of their own pockets that could actually deliver to their children. This has created a level playing field, where all children suffering from autism or any of the disorders that are on the autism spectrum can access services.
           </p>
           <p>
            Autism is a lifelong developmental disability characterised by difficulties in social interaction, impaired communication, restricted and repetitive interests and behaviours, and sensory sensitivities. Before I became a member of parliament I used to work with people with disabilities. I had a male client with autism and another with Aspergers. Autism and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASD" rel="nofollow">
             ASD
            </a>
            , autism spectrum disorders, are much more common in males than in females. Both of these young men had exceptional abilities. One was absolutely brilliant when it came to electronics. He could do just about everything with electronics and I managed to help him secure a job. Unfortunately, because he did not have the social skills, he could not communicate and interact and he ended up losing that job. The other young man swam for Australia in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
             Special Olympics
            </a>
            teams. He had autism. He went to a special school. I believe that if the programs that are available now had been available for him when he was younger he would have achieved a lot more than he has been able to achieve.
           </p>
           <p>
            Autism and disorders on that spectrum are disorders where you can get the best outcomes for a person who suffers from that disorder if there is early intervention. My niece is probably one of the best trained health professionals in Australia on autism. She trained overseas and is now working in a private practice. For years she lobbied me about the importance of early intervention. I wrote to the previous government, the Howard government, and tried to encourage them to do something about providing services at that early age for young people who had ASD. Unfortunately nothing happened. Only now are there programs available for young people, programs that allow them to get the services they need. It is giving them the opportunity to enjoy things that other children enjoy and develop the skills and knowledge that will help them in later life.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know this is an issue that the member for Kingston is passionate about and it is with great pleasure that I support her in this motion. I know that this government is determined to see that all children who suffer from autism have access to early intervention, because it is early intervention that makes a difference in their lives.

             I also want to congratulate the member for Kingston for bringing this motion to the House and I point out to the members that I too have a definite interest in autism. I brought a similar motion to the House on Monday, 6 December 2004, should you wish to look at

             Everyone has a story to tell of autism. My story is the recent walk I undertook on behalf of autism. It was from Friday, 23 March to Thursday, 5 April this year. I conducted this walk for autism throughout my Canning electorate. The walk kicked off at the Mandurah foreshore and involved my walking through the electorate and visiting many of the schools in the electorate to raise awareness for the autism spectrum disorders. By speaking to the students about autism I was able to raise some awareness of the disorder and encourage the students to be respectful of their peers who may live with autism. Autism affects one in 160 children and it is true boys are four times more likely to have autism than girls. It is likely that these students will come across some peers that have some elements of the autism spectrum disorder at some stage, and that was my point to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The walk also helped to raise funds for the Autism Association of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australia
             </a>
             to go towards funding early intervention and respite centres, such as INKA Respite in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Clifton" rel="nofollow">
              Lake Clifton
             </a>
             in my electorate. INKA is run by Todd and Margaret Jarvis. The couple have dedicated a significant amount of their time to setting up the centre. Located on a rural property, INKA provides children and families with emergency and flexible respite in a unique farm-style environment. The centre receives very little government funding, meaning that Todd and Margaret have had to put a huge amount of their own savings into keeping the centre running. I hope that some of the funds that I have raised will go towards assisting INKA Respite.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was also joined on much of the walk by young Dermott Barnard. I first met Dermott when he adopted me through the Adopt-a-Politician program back in 2005. Dermott lives with autism and has made tremendous progress with the assistance of organisations such as the Autism Association and his schools. At the age of 13, Dermott is now part of mainstream schooling at

            </p>
            <p>
             Over the 10 days I visited 42 schools and walked about 100 kilometres, raising over $22Â½ thousand for the Autism Association of Western Australia. I was overwhelmed by the level of support that I received from the schools, the wider community and my fellow parliamentary colleagues who were able to join me on the walk. These included

            <p>
             I would also like to take the opportunity to thank some key people that made the walk a success. These include Dermott's mum Lynne Hearne, Dermott himself, Alyce Barnard, Dermott's sister, and the Autism Association of WA. I was grateful for the support and endorsement of the Autism Association of WA, led by Joan McKenna-Kerr and Paul Baird. The funds that I raised have been invested and deposited with the Autism Association of Western Australia, hopefully earmarked for flexible respite.

             One size does not fit all and there are other alternatives: I will mention one. I would like to commend not only the Autism Association and not-for-profit organisations such as INKA Respite that address this important disorder, often with restricted funding, but also another WA based autism organisation that has been significantly affected by a lack of funding. this organisation is called the

              LEARN
             </a>
             Foundation. As I said, there are many approaches and some fit some programs better than they fit the programs offered elsewhere. The LEARN Foundation offers an alternative approach to tackling autism. This is known as applied behaviour analysis. After recently meeting with the foundation
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
              CEO
             </a>
             , Ms Mandy Mason, I have found that this has proved to be highly successful. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA" rel="nofollow">
              ABA
             </a>
             approach involves intensive work by highly trained behavioural therapists and psychologists and has transformed the lives of many children. Uniquely the LEARN Foundation has been willing to take on the very challenging children who have been unable to interact with others and even shown self-injurious behaviour, such as self harm. It has made tremendous progress with such children.
            </p>
            <p>
             LEARN have been through some financial difficulties. They need to raise $300,000 to stop their doors from closing. They are trying very hard with little state government funding. Any funding that can be given to them will be well spent.
