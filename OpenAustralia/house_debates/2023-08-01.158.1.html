        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        is one of the most economically productive parts of the country, across diversified industries ranging from agriculture and tourism to mining. With 12 million cattle, it is the world's fifth-largest beef exporter. It's also the fifth-largest sugar exporter, with 3,000 farms. Those two sectors alone amount to $3 billion a year. Another industry that's heavily associated with the north, of course, is mining. Iron ore alone—98 per cent of it is mined in Western Australia's Pilbara, and it will generate $100 billion in export earnings this year. The same goes for the gas industry, whose export earnings reached a record $92.8 billion, almost $100 billion, in 2022, and 93 per cent of Australian gas deposits are in Western Australia's North West Shelf, providing feedstock to northern projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        The north is also home to a periodic table's worth of critical minerals and rare earths, with 81 major projects under consideration worth up to $42 billion. That figure is only set to grow in the coming decades. According to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Industry" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Industry
        </a>
        , Science and Resources modelling, critical minerals could add $133½ billion to the economy—more than iron ore and gas—and create 262,000 jobs if we captured a larger share of refining in Australia. We must absolutely move into downstream processing, and that's why the Albanese government announced its Critical Minerals Strategy 2023-2030 that was released last month. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        also has important deposits, and it boasts rich rare earth deposits, such as those mined in the Arafura Nolans project.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's crucial that all of the

         NT
        </a>
        's elements be in the critical minerals list, which the government committed to updating on a regular basis. The minerals are critical on two grounds. First, their supply chains are highly concentrated in one market, China, and are vulnerable to shocks. Secondly, they are used in sensitive defence technologies on which both we and our partners and allies depend. A recent

        military equipment, almost every weapon used in Ukraine and every fighter jet, navy vessel and nuclear weapon on earth relies on rare earths, with few substitutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The north is also a breadbasket for Australia and the Indo-Pacific region. Take Humpty Doo Barramundi farm, for example. It is the biggest Australian owned fish farm in the country. Dan Richards and his family have been in business for 30 years, and they're employing 150 people. We should celebrate their great work for creating opportunities in the territory for Territorians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond its thriving industries, northern Australia is also the sword and shield of the nation, hosting a sprawling network of defence bases and infrastructure. Our government made clear in the

         Defence
        </i>
        <i>
         strategic review
        </i>
        that the primary strategic significance of northern Australia is for our defence and national security policy. To that end, the government announced $3.8 billion in investment upgrades to develop our northern bases over the next four years. I was privileged to spend some time on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF

        Base Darwin last week, joining

         Exercise Talisman Sabre
        </a>
        2023 as part of the ADF's parliamentary program. It's always an honour to join the men and women in the uniform of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        , whether it's out in the field, at a RAAF base, on one of their ships, on a submarine or around their barracks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, it is with a heavy heart that we pay tribute to the four missing aircrew of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRH" rel="nofollow">
         MRH
        </a>
        -90 that was lost recently: Captain Danniel Lyon, Lieutenant Maxwell Nugent, Warrant Officer Class 2 Joseph Laycock and Corporal Alexander Naggs. I thank all the ADF personnel, the search-and-rescue and our allies, the US and Canada, for assisting in those search efforts for the MRH-90, and we hope the families have that closure that they so richly deserve. So massive is the sacrifice of those families who lose their loved ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just last month, the Albanese government and the Northern Territory government signed an agreement to establish the Defence Accommodation Precinct Darwin at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Howard Springs
        </a>
        . This deal ensured that over 1,300 military personnel from Australia and partner nations could be hosted during Talisman Sabre, but it's got a lot more capacity than that. It is another step in improving the ADF's ability to operate from Australia's northern bases, one of the six priority areas mentioned in the

        .

        Northern Australia is more than what it produces, and it is more even than the defence edge that it gives our nation through its proximity to the Indo-Pacific region. The north is also a cultural tone-setter for our nation. The Yirrkala bark petitions, land rights, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Wave Hill
        </a>
        walk-off—all of these extraordinary events began in the beating red heart of northern Australia, before radiating out to the rest of the country. We see this again with the Statement from the Heart, which our government supports in full.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         The Voice
        </a>
        , which has now reached boardrooms, sports clubs and schools around the nation, was first heard outside Uluru in 2017, some time ago. When northern Australia speaks, it may take time, but the country eventually has the opportunity to listen.
       </p>
       <p>
        What it is now saying is that it's time for a new approach to closing the gap. The latest
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        report concluded that 11 of our targets were not on track. That means that we are failing as a nation. Whether it be with respect to the birthweight of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        babies; educational outcomes; youth employment, which is shockingly low; living conditions; or the suicide rate, we are failing First Nations people, who still lag well behind non-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        on these metrics. No proud country can accept that. These figures are a national shame. Only two targets are on track: reaching 62 per cent employment and achieving a 15 per cent increase in land subject to First Nations people's legal rights so that they're able to develop land in order to get proper, real jobs and enjoy the development that most others in Australia have been able to enjoy. In March the government announced $400 million in additional funding to close the gap, including for reliable water infrastructure, remote housing and food security. But there's still much work to be done by all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        First Nations people are still far more likely to be jailed, to die by suicide and to have their children removed than non-Indigenous Australians, and the rates of Indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody are appalling. In the NT, almost 90 per cent of the adult prison population is First Nations people. In juvenile detention, and I've visited Don Dale on a number of occasions, it's about 100 per cent. If that doesn't speak to you, I don't know what will. When it is true that a young Aboriginal male is more likely to go to jail than to university, we're failing. We've got to do things better. With justice reinvestment programs, we have a plan to tackle the root causes of crime and reoffending, including through rehabilitation services. Justice reinvestment in places like Bourke in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        has proven to be effective not only in reducing crime and keeping adults and young people out of custody but in leading to social and economic improvements.
       </p>
       <p>
        First Nations led organisations understand the needs of their communities best, which is why they will be at the forefront of rolling out this program. I'm proud that four NT communities, including Darwin, have been chosen, as part of an $81 million funding package, to deliver new community led and holistic approaches to keep at-risk individuals out of the criminal justice system. This includes investing in early intervention and prevention programs and initiatives for adults and young people. Other activities will focus on substance abuse, engagement with school, family support and the criminal justice system itself. Ninti One is an organisation that the Attorney-General's Department selected to be a justice reinvestment partner. I met with Rod Reeve to discuss their excellent work in offering capacity building to First Nations communities. I look forward to seeing the great work on justice reinvestment that is currently underway being rolled out in Darwin. A north that is stronger economically, militarily and socially will strengthen the fabric of our whole nation.
