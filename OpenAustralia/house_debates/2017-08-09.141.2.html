         Con Sciacca
        </a>
        was a figure much larger than life and a great character of Australian politics. It is right and proper that this House pays its respects to him and regrets his untimely passing, which was far too early. Of course, Con's great achievement in this House was as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and he was a very, very good one. It was a portfolio which he asked the then Prime Minister, Prime Minister Keating, for. I was here at that time, not as a member of parliament but around the building, and I remember Con arranging briefings about Australia Remembers, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , which was very much his initiative, one which he carried out with great gusto, and was an outstanding success. He was also a very dedicated member of the House in terms of servicing his constituents and ensuring that their needs were met and that they had a strong voice in this House.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, of course, while I was aware of Con and saw him and met him when he was a minister, it was only after he'd left parliament that I really came to know him and came to know him very well. He became a friend of mine, as he was to so many in the House, particularly on this side of the House. I want to say this about Con Sciacca: he was a generous man. I don't mean by way of money, I don't mean by way of resources, but I mean he was generous in terms of his support, his time and his care for members who were young and who were trying to find their way through this House—always quick with advice but never quick to interfere; when asked, always happy to oblige with advice and with support and to give every support possible. I came to know Con in that context, first in his support of myself, as he got to know me and was very willing and obliging to provide that advice and support, and then in his support of others, including the member for Oxley, who has just joined us, and other members, particularly in Queensland but not exclusively in Queensland, not only in Queensland. He was always there, always at the other end of the phone, always willing to take the call, always happy to oblige and always willing to accommodate. It's that generosity of spirit that I talk of today.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, I came to know him well. I shared many jokes and laughs with him. Of course, he was a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , but he was very honoured to hold Italian honours as well, as did my distinguished predecessor as member for Prospect, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janice_Crosio" rel="nofollow">
         Janice Crosio

        , who was a Cavaliere of the Order of Merit of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Republic" rel="nofollow">
         Italian Republic
        </a>
        , but, as Con would point out to me with great glee, he held a higher honour, as I understand it: the equivalent of a knight,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Grand Cross
        </a>
        of the Italian Republic. He would correct my Italian pronunciation, which is very ordinary, of these particular honours, and we would have long talks about that and about many aspects of Australian politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        I didn't want to detain the House today, but simply to add my condolences to those of other honourable members. Con Sciacca was a good man with a big heart and a huge personality. I miss him. It's common to say in these things, 'It's hard to believe he's gone,' but it is really hard to believe that Con Sciacca has gone. He was always there, and I think I speak for members in this House when I say he always will be there in our hearts and he will always be remembered. Although he is no longer there at the other end of the phone—his number's in my phone—I look at it wistfully, thinking, for the first time, he won't answer. But I know that he always wanted the Labor Party, which he loved so much, to prosper and to do well. And he would want that after he was gone—as he wanted his nation to do well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our condolences to his family, some of whom I have come to know, not all of them, through my friendship with Con, and I know they much loved him, as we all did, and they miss him even more than we do. But they can take pride in his great achievements as an Australian. Although there were times, I am sure, when they missed him, they could always be proud of him. And although they miss him now, they can always be proud of him into the future.

        <p>
         I am honoured to stand today to talk in respect and memory of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Sciacca" rel="nofollow">
          Con Sciacca
         </a>
         . It would have been the beginning of 1991 when I first met Con and his son, Sam, was in my year at school at Nudgee college. The first time I met Con—the members opposite will probably enjoy this—I had made a speech at the start of the school year to the school community, and parents and friends must have been there, too. Having made that speech—probably being school captain, I would say, is why I had that gig—Con came up afterwards. I had never met the man and didn't know who he was. Con called out to me. I turned around and went over, as you do, and introduced myself. He didn't introduce himself. He just said, 'Mate, you need to join the Labor Party!' So they were Con's first words to me. The great thing was, when I explained, 'Well, Mr Sciacca,' once I had come to know who he was, 'I'm, actually, the other way inclined when it comes to politics,' he was brilliant. He made it very clear, when I told him I am not a Labor man, that that's okay by him; as long as I'm a good bloke, that's all right by Con. That was Con, and it was Con ever after.
        </p>
        <p>
         I stand in this chamber today not as a person for the Labor movement. I don't stand here as a relative of Con's, nor do I stand here today as a previous parliamentary colleague of Con's. Con, later in life, whether it be by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS" rel="nofollow">
          SMS
         </a>
         , email or in person, would refer to me as 'old mate'. So maybe I stand here today as one of his many old mates—not an old mate that Con would necessarily ring up to confide in and share his deepest thoughts. Yet such was the man that when you met him you would know that he was completely open, brutally open, with his honesty, which was just so valuable. An old mate, I suppose, I may have been to Con, not in the sense that he would ring me up and we would knock around together, but once you did socialise with Con, such was the man that he would make you feel as though you were the centre of the earth. He would make you feel so special. That's who he was. He was such a generous, larger-than-life, charismatic character.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where I think my relationship with Con developed, strangely enough, was through the tragedy of death. In 1991, when Con's son, Sam, and I were in the same year at Nudgee college, a student in our year, Adam Monahan, sadly took his own life by jumping off the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
          Gateway Bridge
         </a>
         in Brisbane. This had an enormous effect on the school community, not to mention the family. Con, being in this parliament and able to wield a bit of influence, went to great lengths to ensure that barriers were installed either side of that Gateway Bridge. The numbers of people who sought to jump off that bridge dropped by somewhere over 85 per cent within a year of them being installed. Thus, through the tragedy that occurred with that family and that boy, Adam, who was a friend of ours at school, Con delivered. He got a tangible outcome that has subsequently, no doubt, saved lives. When you think of the 2½ thousand or more Australians who take their lives every single year, that is nearly seven a day. Con Sciacca sought to do his bit.
        </p>
        <p>
         A year later, in 1992, of greater personal tragedy to Con was the passing of his son, Sam, who was in my year, from a rare bone cancer. You can imagine the impact this had on Con. Con was, in my view, first and foremost a family man. Losing his boy, Sam—or, Sammy, as he would call him—had an enormous impact on Con. It was a pleasure to attend the launch of a fellowship that he started soon thereafter, with the Labor Party, in honour of his son. Sam was not unlike Con. Does anyone remember grade 12 videos? You may have done one at school yourselves. We did a video in our year 12, when Sammy was going through his treatment. As soon as the video camera came around, he had no problems with taking his hat off and showing his bald head. He was then an 18-year-old boy, one year from passing away. He knew what his limited future held. But his was a big personality. He had a big smile. He was happy for the world to see his shaved head. Before Christmas, as I sat with Con Sciacca on his patio at the top of the tower in the CBD—Con sat with his shirt off, totally relaxed, just like Sammy—he spoke very openly about looking forward to the day when he would be reunited with him.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, I say from this side of the House, but probably more personally just from me and maybe also from those whom I went to school with, that we send our greatest sympathies to the Sciacca family. It was a privilege to attend the funeral. Con was about family. He was about friends, which I came to realise. As we saw on 30 June at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Stephen's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
          St Stephen's Cathedral
         </a>
         , he was also a man of faith. Family, faith and friends. God bless Con Sciacca and may he rest in peace. Thank you.

          </p>
          <p>
           It is often said that in Labor we make the saints, and surely with the passing of Con Sciacca we have lost one of our greatest. Con Sciacca exemplified everything about true public service: selflessness, empathy, relentless hard work and a passion to improve the lives of all citizens of this beloved country. Con Sciacca was a walking, talking example of what migrants contribute to this country. Aged four, he arrived in Australia from Sicily. He did law the hard way, the solicitor's board, while working full-time and helping to support his family. Not born to wealth or with contacts to give him a kick-start in life, Con worked hard in establishing his own law firm from scratch—a firm that ultimately became Queensland's largest local Labor law firm, where many prominent lawyers, politicians and union officials got their first start. It was also where they learned the value of hard work and an absolute commitment to customer satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
           As an active member of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Labor" rel="nofollow">
            Young Labor
           </a>
           from the start, Con made national contacts at a very early age. His politics were always moderate, his debating style emphatic and his socialising legendary. He was the Queensland Young Labor president in 1972, the year that I was born. In these times, it is not uncommon for young operators to think their talents demand accommodation in a safe seat or, worse still, to complain, agitate or rat when things did not go their own way. Always a betting man, Con Sciacca had a number of false starts along the way. No-one is really fully baptised in Labor until they have had a kick in the guts and come up trumps. Con would cop the setbacks and defeats just as well as the victories—a lesson for those who presume their talents and skills will always be recognised by the party and endorsed by the electorate.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 1969, he unsuccessfully contested the safe Liberal state seat of Mount Coot-tha. In 1977, 1980 and 1985, which was a by-election, he contested the marginal National Party seat of Redlands. His campaign was remarkable. He took defeats and disappointment with good grace. Alongside his life-long friend Brian Kilmartin, Con joined the Labor Forum, or the right-wing faction, in Queensland. When times were tough, they became some of the pillars of support for all who have joined ever since. Con worked hard and, together with his outstanding campaign director, Joan Budd, won a hard-fought preselection and went on to become the federal member for Bowman from 1987 to 1996 and then from 1998 to 2004.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sciacca was an outstanding success and, no doubt, the first Queensland MP to run his office in a modern fashion. He ran his office with the productivity of his law firm—dictating letters and actioning memos on his hand-held recorder with ever-mounting piles of tapes for processing. He was accessible and media friendly. His talent and hard work paid off in a promotion to the ministerial office. He was most proud of his achievements as Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the Keating government. His work in securing a better deal for veterans was legendary, including in long-running compensation and justice issues. He's particularly remembered for his Australia Remembers campaign of recognition for those hundreds of thousands of Australians who served this country—whose service abroad and at home was acknowledged. In many respects, this was the key early factor in encouraging all of us to reflect on their sacrifices and schools and communities to attend and commemorate veteran services in ever-increasing numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Such was the regard he was held in, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
            RSL
           </a>
           made him an honorary life member—an extraordinary accolade for a non-service person—for his service to veterans. His work in this field and other fields was recognised via his appointment in 2006 as an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Officer of the Order of Australia
           </a>
           for service to ex-service personnel, cancer research institutions and the Australian parliament. Sciacca's service was also recognised, as we've heard, by the governments of Italy and Finland, who respectfully awarded him the Order of Merit of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Republic" rel="nofollow">
            Italian Republic
           </a>
           —one of Italy's highest honours—and a Commander of the Order of the Lion of Finland.
          </p>

           Sciacca made many friends in his time in federal politics. He was capable of playing politics very hard but always with honour and decency. This gained him friendships from all sides of politics—maybe drawing the lines at the Greens. After leaving federal parliament—if anything—he increased his political activity, if that was possible, and actively fundraised and supported Labor candidates from right across the party. But, in particular, he was a supporter and confidante to Labor Forum members and senators. His fundraising lunches were legendary. The business community clamoured to attend as they were entertaining as well as informative. His introductions of attendees around the table often had the audience in stitches. No-one was left out, and all felt important and part of the family.

           Group. However, he was very reluctant to lobby friends. He had a clear distinction and strong ethical boundaries that were the cornerstone to his and their continued high standing all around. Sciacca had many close long-standing personal friends—people like

           . He didn't desert mates when they fell on hard times. Equally, he was happy to assist around the country in fundraising, particularly at Labor Party dinners attended by the Italian community.

           Con Sciacca never sought appointments post political office. His reward was to help and see success in others. He may have cultivated a persona of a tough operator, and he certainly could be one, but he was far more a friend than an enemy, a supporter than a detractor and a planner than a plotter. Con was devastated by the loss of his son Sammy, who was 19 years old. He was devastated by the loss of his mother, to whom he was devoted. He had a large and loving family. He doted on his daughter, Zina, who reciprocated in spades, and was smitten by his beautiful granddaughter Gracie. He was so happy with his wife, Karen, and her unwavering love and support, and he treated her sons, Nick and Daniel, as his own and was very proud of them.

           Concetto Sciacca passed away just a week after his 70th birthday—a happy and joyous occasion surrounded by family, close friends and extraordinary amounts of Sicilian food washed down by his beautiful signature Elderton Command Shiraz. Con was an extraordinary person in my life and the lives of so many others. Rest in peace, Con.
