       <p>
        I wish to call on the Australian government to commit to continuing the carer bonus, an initiative created by the Howard government. The bonus to carers is an annual one-off payment made since 2004 and is an essential contribution to the budget of families and carers. This decision to not continue it will impact the most vulnerable in our community. The Labor government are talking about the budget causing pain, but this poorly thought out decision will impact carers and those they care for.

        I wish to speak about Linda and Kevin and their daughter, Georgia. Their story appears on the FaHCSIA website in the
        <i>
         Carers Storybook
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ten-year-old Georgia was born with an undiagnosed genetic condition which has left her with the intellectual and developmental age of an 18-month-old.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ‘I’m still feeding her, changing her nappies, giving her a bath, brushing her teeth…all things I should have stopped doing eight years ago,’ her mother Linda says.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, in Linda’s words:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ‘As parents we can never relax. We’re always on edge and trying to anticipate the next step.’
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The daily regime begins early with a nappy change. ‘Even to get nappies for a 10-year-old isn’t easy. You can’t just pop down to the supermarket and pick them up if you run out. You have to plan ahead and order them as it takes a week for them to arrive.’
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Once she has dressed Georgia, Linda sits her in a modified high chair and feeds her finely mashed food. ‘Then I do all personal care such as teeth and hair and get Georgia ready for the school bus.’
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After school Georgia likes to spend time in her treasured swing in the backyard.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ‘Georgia could spend all day in that swing and would let us push her for hours on end. Luckily Kevin is a hands-on dad and is great with her when he comes home from work.’
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When Georgia is at school Linda is able to work, managing the promotional products section of her parent’s business.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ‘I am fortunate my parents were able to restructure their business to employ me. …’
       </p>
       <p>
        Linda and Kevin work as a tag team. They are a great team. But without the carer bonus they will not be able to purchase essential items for their daughter, Georgia, such as shoes, which cost over $200—they are special shoes designed for her to keep her safe and to ensure that they stay on her feet. The carer bonus enables them to purchase large products. We heard in their story about the swing; the swing cost over $800. They could not just pop down to the shop and buy a Target or Woolworths swing for $150; they had to get a special one built for her, and this bonus enables them to do that. A payment that is spread throughout the year, whilst maybe beneficial, would not enable them to purchase the big things that they need. It is important to note here that, if Linda did not have the circumstances associated with Georgia, she would be able to earn a lot more and would be able to provide for her family in a greater way.
