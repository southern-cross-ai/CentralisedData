        My question is to the Minister for Jobs and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations" rel="nofollow">
         Industrial Relations
        </a>
        , and Minister for Women. Will the minister update the House on how the government's plan for a safer and more secure Australia is supporting the safety of our Australian women?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and also for her very strong advocacy and support on behalf of the Shoalhaven Women's Health Centre, which is a very important centre in her constituency that helps women and children affected by domestic violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every woman in this country has the right to be safe in their community, online, at their workplace and in their home. We all know the terrible statistics around domestic violence in this country, and we must never forget that every single one of those statistics is a wife, a mother, a daughter, a friend, a work colleague. We must agree as a parliament that it is not right for women not to be protected and safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has, in fact, got a strong plan to keep women and children safe, to protect them from the scourge of domestic violence. We have committed well in excess of $350 million in safety initiatives since 2015, including additional funding for 1800RESPECT, the national sexual assault, domestic and family violence counselling line. It will deal in this financial year with around 160,000 contacts and is a vital resource for those people who are experiencing traumatic events.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of the Women's Economic Security Statement, the very first time that we as a parliament have delivered such a statement, we provided $14.9 million to Good Shepherd Microfinance for no-interest loans, to help women to be able to rebuild their financial security in a safe environment. The government has extended funding of more than $42 million for specialist domestic violence units and health justice partnerships, which will help women and children with legal advice and health services when they have experienced family and domestic violence. And, for the first time, we have enshrined five days of leave for domestic and family violence as a minimum workplace right in the National Employment Standards. But, of course, we're doing more and must do more. Only this week the government announced $60 million of additional investment in emergency accommodation—something that I know is a particular passion project for the Minister for Families and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Social Services
         </a>
         —as well as $18 million of continued support to help keep women and children safe in their own homes.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister has said, domestic violence is a national security issue, and it is a commitment for every single one of us in this place and at all levels of government. I hope it continues to receive bipartisan support.
