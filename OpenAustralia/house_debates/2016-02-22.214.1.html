        Last Saturday I attended the Henley
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving
        </a>
        Club junior presentation. It was great to see so many young children receive acknowledgement and so I want to congratulate all the juniors on their efforts during the season. Special congratulations to all of the age group leaders on their voluntary work over the summer, in particular, the junior manager Nikki von Bertouch, Rachel and Brett Roe, Gary Ashton, Cat Bahr and the many others who assisted the juniors. I saw firsthand at my children's surf club at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Beach" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the numerous junior carnivals the fine work undertaken by the age managers.
       </p>

        Henley surf club have just completed their 10th Big Row fundraiser and I understand it was another success with around $60,000 raised. All funds raised go towards funding the club's surf life saving activities. Well done to all participants who traversed

        , covering around 60 km of open sea, as well as the many supporters of the event. I was not able to make it this year to have a look, but I have supported the event in previous years. I look forward to their next Big Row.

        Still on surf lifesaving, well done to the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club on their hosting of the junior carnival a week ago. It was a well organised event, and I know from watching my daughter participate that the children enjoyed the competition immensely. So thanks to the team at the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club, including Sarah Tidswell,

        , Adam Luscombe and Emma Martin for their outstanding efforts. And well done to those who managed the barbecue at the surf club. After a long day on the beach, I know my family appreciated the chance to have a late midafternoon lunch and support the surf club at the same time.
