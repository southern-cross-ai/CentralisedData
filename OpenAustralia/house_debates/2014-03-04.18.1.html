        On 19 February, Fairfield city lost one of its most loved residents.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Burgess" rel="nofollow">
         John Burgess
        </a>
        , the former president of both the Fairfield
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Memorial Club and the Fairfield RSL sub-branch from 1995 to 2013, succumbed to cancer. John was a member of the board of directors of the club from 1989 to 1993, then vice-president from 1993 to 1995 and president from 1995 to 2013. He was a very worthy successor to the late Bruce Short as president of the club. I remember when Bruce passed away it left a big hole in the club, and John fulfilled that role very well indeed over many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        His involvement in the club first began in 1967, when he became a member of the soccer section committee, and he was president of the youth club from 1970 to 1973. John was an icon to the veterans of our community. He and his wife, Jeannette, were constant attenders at every event and recognition of our veterans community, and they were constantly in the service of our veterans community and also the service of the club movement more generally. He served as sub-branch assistant secretary and as vice-president from 1985 to 1987 and was involved in the RSL club movement more generally.
       </p>
       <p>
        His wife, Jeannette, and he are very well-known residents of Smithfield. My condolences go to Jeannette and their children and stepchildren. Lest we forget. He will always be remembered.
