        is a breeding ground for young athletes. We have young people who are gifted and skilled in all kinds of sports, and it's an honour to be able to help a few who compete at an elite level by giving them a small amount of money to cover some of their expenses through the Local Sporting Champions grant scheme. Through this round of the Local Sporting Champions and Local Para Champions grants, I was able to help an amazing 25 young sports men and women who were competing at state, national or international level.

        Our para-athletes were represented strongly in swimming, with Emilee Pratt and Lexie Phillips competing at the national championships in Queensland and Porscha Jimmieson and Jakob Thompson competing at the Virtus Global Games in France. I look forward to seeing you at the Paralympics one day. The Hunter is also lucky to have Mackenzie Wills, who represented Australia in basketball at the world championships and the Virtus Global Games.

        Congratulations to all the young athletes that competed and achieved so much. I hope to continue to watch you in the future, and I look forward to seeing your progress.
