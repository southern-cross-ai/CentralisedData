        It was my distinct pleasure last Friday to visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Anthony" rel="nofollow">
         St Anthony
        </a>
        ’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Primary School
        </a>
        for what was unquestionably a momentous occasion in the life of that school. St Anthony’s is located in the township of Lara on the northern outskirts of my electorate and the boundary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_Geelong" rel="nofollow">
         City of Greater Geelong
        </a>
        . It is a coeducational Catholic primary school that for the last 25 years has catered to the educational needs of a growing region. Over the course of its existence, St Anthony’s has developed its enrolment thanks to the considered guidance of its school board, now chaired by Mr Brendan Madden, the daily leadership of the school principal, Ms Marie Cassar, who is doing an excellent job, and the St Anthony’s Parents and Friends Association, now led by Mrs Karen Sherwell.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have in my short time in this role been privileged to visit many schools and open many new facilities in my electorate. While I always enjoy these events immensely, I must say that after attending this particular event I left feeling that I had just attended something very special indeed. In the presence of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
         Auxiliary Bishop
        </a>
        of Melbourne His Excellency Bishop Christopher Proust, parish priest Father Johnny Joseph, the school leadership team, staff and about 200 parents, friends and community members I was able to open new and refurbished facilities that had been funded in large part by this Commonwealth government. I was able to participate in the blessing of these new facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        In two separate projects, the government contributed a total of $380,000 to upgrade and refurbish staff administrative areas and four classrooms to provide improved and more adaptable learning spaces. This funding was matched by $177,838 from St Anthony’s to bring the total funding for the project to in excess of half a million dollars. Classrooms are very special places. When you consider all the revelations that will be had, all the discovery that will be done and all the connections that will be made in these classrooms, it was a very special thing indeed to be there at the opening of these rooms.
       </p>
       <p>
        This investment represents an investment not only in St Anthony’s Primary School but also in Lara. Lara is a region which has had to deal with its fair share of issues. Until recently it had suffered the scourge of teen suicide, with one of the highest rates in Australia. But in recent years this tide has begun to turn. It is difficult to pinpoint the precise impetus for this change, but many have pointed to the renewed sense of community that has accompanied the establishment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
         Lara Secondary College
        </a>
        . Schools, be they primary or secondary, are places which draw communities together and communities provide support. This was evident to me last Friday at St Anthony’s as I not only watched the community rally around to support its school but also saw a school which was prepared to invest in itself and in its community by providing improved learning places for its students. I take this opportunity to again thank the leadership group at St Anthony’s for the chance to visit their school and, more importantly, be welcomed into their community.
