       <p>
        Last Friday I was able to join the Heathcote district residents at the launch of their $2.9 million primary healthcare redevelopment. Construction of the Heathcote primary healthcare facility is well underway. This was made possible from the former Labor government's investment in health.
       </p>
       <p>
        The redevelopment will involve the construction of a new primary health facility on site with the hospital, as well as refurbishing the current consultation rooms. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Heathcote Health, Dr Douglass, said that the development will allow Heathcote residents to come to a virtual one-stop shop in their own town. The redevelopment will give people at Heathcote and the surrounding areas greater access to most of the important and primary healthcare facilities that they need. It means fewer will have to travel the hour's distance to Bendigo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Heathcote Health is committed to providing accessible health services to the people of Heathcote, which is why this redevelopment was so important. It was funded by the former Labor government through the Primary Care Infrastructure Grants Program and the Health and Hospitals Fund. Without this grant, without this fund, this vital redevelopment would not occur. The difference between Labor and Liberal when it comes to health is that Labor invests and builds and all the Liberals do is cut.
