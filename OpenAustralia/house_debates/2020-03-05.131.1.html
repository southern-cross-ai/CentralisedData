        With parliament sitting across the first four weeks of the school year in 2020 it has been a great pity that I have had to miss many school leadership ceremonies and inductions across the north side. It is a great pity for me because they are probably among my very favourite parts of the job. In the spirit of

         International Women's Day
        </a>
        this Sunday, and celebrating the achievements of our women, I would like to take this opportunity at least to recognise and congratulate some of the very meritorious young women in my electorate of Lilley who have been inducted as school leaders for 2020.

        I would also like to recognise the trailblazing work of Lesley Hanson in honour of International Women's Day this Sunday morning. Lesley Hanson herself is a mother of three from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavell_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Wavell Heights
        </a>
        and the assistant Scout leader of the Wavell Heights Scout Group. In the 1970s Lesley was asked to be in a Scouts Queensland trial crew to 'see if women could be in scouting'. Lesley played a pivotal role in reshaping Scouts Queensland entirely from a male-dominated group to an organisation that sponsors young boys and young girls to develop confidence, resilience and leadership skills. In 1990 Lesley helped to create the Wavell Heights Scout Group, which still remains active today. Since then she has mentored more than 200 children in Wavell Heights. Lesley, thank you very much for your work in making Scouts a more inclusive and equal place for all of our young people and for all that you have done to mentor our young people across the north side. It is people like you, active citizens on the north side, that make our community so great. I'm very proud to honour you and your work this International Women's Day.
