        My question is to the Treasurer. Deloitte Access Economics now says the budget has deteriorated by $38 billion. How much of that deterioration occurred since he became Treasurer and how much occurred during the months he was conspiring to become Treasurer?

          I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. As she would know, the MYEFO statement will come out in December—and that will follow the December quarter national accounts which will be released this week—and that is when the government will be updating our position on the budget. She makes reference to the Deloitte report that has come out today which highlights two very significant issues confronting the budget—commodity prices and growth in China. The Deloitte report also refers to one of the things that will be working against the government as we seek to repair the budget—the $17 billion worth of savings measures which are being opposed by those opposite.
         </p>
         <p>
          I find it galling that those opposite would seek to ask us about the position of the budget when they are standing in the way of a $17 billion improvement in the budget because they continue to oppose measures. But they oppose far more than that. There are over $55 million worth of things they are opposing and commitments they are putting forward—and they have come up with a grand total of about $5 billion to pay for it! Those opposite know what they left this government in terms of the fiscal mess that we are addressing. We will continue every day the job of putting together and implementing policies that support growth and jobs, and we are controlling expenditure. That is how you get to surplus. Those opposite believe the way back to surplus is to increase taxes over and over again to chase their endless appetite for spending.
