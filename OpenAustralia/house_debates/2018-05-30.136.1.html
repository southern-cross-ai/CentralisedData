        It is a great opportunity this evening to stand up for my local community on the northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        , especially in terms of the recreational and economic activity driven by boating. It is a big part of working and playing in the northern Gold Coast. It's why I'm delighted to inform the House and report back about the results from the 30th

         Sanctuary Cove
        </a>
        International Boat Show. It's the Southern Hemisphere's premier marine event. The size and scope of this marine event is quite extraordinary. This year there were over 180 boats on water, 275 boats on land and over 300 exhibiters around the world converging at Sanctuary Cove to present a world-class event. It is popular. There were 45,866 visitors walking through the gates over the four days. Each year, this event puts about $150 million into the local economy, adding value to local tourism and boosting Australian and local marine production. It boosts jobs, it boosts business, and it makes a huge difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last three decades that the Sanctuary Cove International Boat Show has been running, over 10,000 exhibiters have shown off their world-class wares and over 1.4 million visitors have been through the gates. In terms of long-term economic benefit, we're talking $3 billion in spend for the region in accommodation, tourism, event spending and investment. In any term, in any way, on any ledger, this is a substantial investment in the local economy. This is a substantial global event, especially in boating terms. It is very popular in terms of B-to-B. Enormous trade occurs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sanctuary Cove International Boat Show is also a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         International Federation
        </a>
        of Boat Show Organisers. Its slogan, if one could call it that, quite rightly is: 'This is where the marine industry does business.' The boat show delivers a comprehensive marine trade display, it showcases the latest innovation in industry and it attracts global and national brands and businesses. In the days prior to the boat show, the Australian Superyacht, Marine Export and Commercial Marine Industry Conference welcomed international speakers and delegates to Sanctuary Cove. Look at where we've come from in 30 years. I'm so proud of this event. It showcases what Australia can do in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are a proud boating community on the Gold Coast. Eleven per cent of Queensland's recreational boats are located in my community. We love the water. We are an electorate that hugs the magnificent broadwater. According to the latest data, there are more than 28,000 recreational boats and 700 commercial vessels registered on the Gold Coast. We seriously do love the water. Because of this, I'm very pleased to support the dredging of our waterways, which is commencing shortly, and encourage all governments to ensure that that continues to happen. It's an essential element of maintenance—no different from fixing roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also support the government increasing the customs terminal. It was there for 12 months as a test at Southport. I think it has shown the rationale and the reason for the move, and we need to extend that permanently. I also believe there is an opportunity—and I've been reaching out to the Labor Party on this—to deal with the issue of the 10 per cent impost of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        on any superyacht that comes to Australia and wishes to charter. Right now, we face the farcical situation where there are no registered superyachts in Australia. These large boats come to Australia. There is a market for charter, but the current law in this place says that if the $100 million

        , a boat built in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        but owned offshore, comes here and someone wants to charter it, they first of all must pay 10 per cent of the price of the yacht. The yacht owner must pay $10 million to the Commonwealth for the privilege of charter. So surprise, surprise, how many million dollars come in from chartering? Zero. So why don't we apply a modicum of common sense and get rid of this ridiculous rule of 10 per cent GST on charter boats. It is something we can all agree on. Let us go forth and build a great boating industry, not just for the Gold Coast but for the entire country.
