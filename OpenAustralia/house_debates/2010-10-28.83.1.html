              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay" rel="nofollow">
               Moreton Bay
              </a>
              rail link becomes a reality. This is a great project that will open up public transport travel for the people of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcliffe_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
               Redcliffe Peninsula
              </a>
              . It will also benefit those communities further up the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
               Bruce Highway
              </a>
              , because it will alleviate urban congestion. It will make a difference to climate change. We need to transfer more people out of private cars and onto public transport as part of dealing with climate change.
             </p>
             <p>
              The rail link will cut travel time from Kippa-Ring to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_CBD" rel="nofollow">
               Brisbane CBD
              </a>
              to just 45 minutes, so it is not surprising that this project has a great deal of support in the local community. That is why, on 26 August, the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland, with the Mayor of Moreton Shire and the local member, announced support for the rail link—that a Gillard Labor government would turn this into a reality. The planning and preconstruction work will be done now, with construction to commence in 2012 and be completed in 2016.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am asked how the project has been received, and of course there has been a great deal of support for it, with one exception—the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
               LNP
              </a>
              candidate for Petrie, Dean Teasdale. He said on the day, ‘Now is not the time to build this rail link.’ This is a project that has been talked about since 1895—but now is not the time, according to the LNP, to move ahead with it. That opposition lasted about as long as one of the member for Sturt’s excuses—not very long at all. By the afternoon the Leader of the Opposition undermined the local candidate by saying he would support it and he would match the commitment. So first they are against it, then they are for it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am asked which levels of government are responsible for delivering the project. There is the Gillard Labor government, there is the Bligh Labor government and there is the local council. But there is some confusion out there. Election ads have started in Petrie already, and in this week’s local paper there is an ad by Dean Teasdale referring to ‘supporting regional action in Petrie; delivering the Moreton Bay rail link’. The LNP are paying for it! Not the government—the LNP! They are doing so well out of their tobacco donations that they are able to build rail lines. It is an unbelievable performance. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say now is not the time to build the rail link and then try to claim credit for it.

Mr Speaker, I ask you: how is this answer consistent with that paradigm?
