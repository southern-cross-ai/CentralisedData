       <p>
        Last Saturday I was delighted to be invited to the Queensland Tennis Awards evening and to be invited to present the award for the outstanding school. There were four finalists: Brookfield State School, Rainworth State School,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Boys_College" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Boys College
        </a>
        and East Ayr State School. I am not skiting but of course three of those schools are in the electorate of Ryan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst all were very deserving winners, Brisbane Boys College was successful on the night. I just want to pay tribute to the remarkable improvement to the tennis program at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" rel="nofollow">
         BBC
        </a>
        â€”and particularly their success in recent years. Incredibly, in 2013, 2014 and 2015 they were the Queensland secondary schools team tennis champions, and also in all three years they were

        </a>
        first four champions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2014, they won the Australian Secondary School Team Tennis Competition, which were held in November. That made them eligible to travel in July this year to represent Australia at Doha in Qatar for the International School Sport Federation, World Schools Championships, where they finished a very respectable fourth place, only separated by one game from first place. The tournament showcases some of the best young players from across the globe. Teams travelled from England, Germany, Italy, Turkey, France, Belgium, China and Brazil to compete. Australia, represented by BBC, came fourth. Well done, College.
