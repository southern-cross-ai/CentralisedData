        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Would the minister update the House on the current state of the Qantas industrial dispute? How is the government helping Australians affected by the Qantas decision to lock out its workforce and to ground its fleet?

         This government's priority when we were informed about the lockout of the workforce and the grounding of the fleet on Saturday was to go to Fair Work Australia and to make sure that we got Qantas back up in the air, because this was not just a lockout of its workforce, it was a lockout of its customers. It is a bit like Telstra having a disagreement with one of its unions and shutting down the telecommunications industry. It is like one of the energy companies, because it is having a problem with one of the unions, turning off the lights and shutting down the power system. It is like one of the water companies having a problem with one of its unions and shutting off the water system. That is why this government thinks that this was an irresponsible and extreme action and why we are so surprised that those opposite have shown their ideological obsession by saying not one word of criticism against Qantas.
        </p>
        <p>
         The parties now, as a result of our action, have 21 days to bargain. We are of the view that parties should talk to each other and settle an agreement rather than engage in militant action, whether it be by employers or employees—either way we oppose. I am advised that Qantas and the pilots have already had one meeting before Fair Work Australia this week. The licensed engineers will meet with Qantas before Fair Work Australia next Monday to continue their negotiations. The Transport Workers Union and Qantas will return to Fair Work Australia next Tuesday. This is a good thing—that we have bargaining in good faith.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to note that Fair Work Australia found that there were good prospects for agreement between the parties prior to Qantas's decision to lock out its workforce and ground its fleet. So I encourage all parties and, indeed, have spoken to all parties to encourage them to get this deal done in the interests of this important, iconic Australian company, in the interests of its workforce and in the national interest. Of course, that has been our approach the whole way through.

         The shadow Treasurer confirmed on the
         <i>
          7.30
         </i>
         program that he knew that Qantas was considering a lockout of its workforce. When asked when he was told, he said: 'Well, I can't recall. Well, I can't recall.' That was his position when told about an action that would be of such damage to the Australian economy—he could not recall when he was told. It is not surprising that he cannot find the $70 billion, that he cannot find a policy on anything at all—

           Today he objected to debating the minerals resource rent tax because he thought it was a new idea he did not see coming. They actually tried to adjourn the debate because they could not see it coming.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our priority is for all parties, and I call upon them to do it, to bargain in good faith—Qantas and the unions—and make sure they get these arrangements agreed in the interests of themselves and in the interests of the nation.
