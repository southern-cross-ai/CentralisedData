       <p>
        I'm very excited to share with the chamber that I've been chosen to represent Australia at the 2019
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         General Assembly
        </a>
        . Next week I'll be making my way to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        . I must say that it was a great honour to be chosen. I'm very humbled by the opportunity to represent Australia and vote on key international issues. The General Assembly is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative body of the United Nations, where all 193 member states have equal representation.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the news of my appointment spreading around my electorate of Bonner, the positive response and support I have received from the community have been outstanding. I'm overcome with the support and the wellwishers who have offered me congratulations as I have spent the last couple of weeks meeting with as many people as I can before I go. Thank you to everyone who has stopped me in the streets, sent me an email or called to congratulate me. Your support means a lot.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm very proud not only to represent Australia but also to be an advocate for the beautiful part of South-East Queensland that I call home. To be joining an international body that makes decisions on important issues, such as those on peace and security, is something that I don't take lightly. From development to peace and security and international law, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations General Assembly
        </a>
        works together on a wide range of issues. I look forward to contributing to discussions and being part of the decision-making process.
       </p>
       <p>
        The outcomes from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNGA" rel="nofollow">
         UNGA
        </a>
        ultimately affect the lives of millions of people around the world as they work towards attaining peace, security and disarmament; supporting development; safeguarding human rights; protecting our environment and strengthening the United Nations. It's a tremendous honour to be chosen to represent our great nation. I look forward to sharing my journey with the House and with the constituents of Bonner when I return.
