       <p>
        I'm very proud to be the patron of the Twin Rivers Community Mallet Sports Club, one of the many great sports clubs in my electorate of Forde. This club was formed by Des and Beryl Schodel and five friends when they started to play croquet on the cricket oval at Olivers Sports Complex in Eagleby in July 2010. By August 2010, the group had grown to 14 players and it was decided to form the Twin Rivers Community Mallet Sports Club. Sadly, Des is no longer with us.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club continued playing on the cricket oval until September 2014, when changes to leasing arrangements meant they were forced to find a new location. Finding a permanent home for their beloved game has been problematic, and over the following six years the club moved to five different locations. But it was with great joy and celebration that club president Ian Every cut the ribbon recently to allow play to begin on their new courts. The club's new courts at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bedford Park
        </a>
        in Eagleby have been made possible thanks to the three levels of government coming together to work for the community. This included a $30,000 community development grant from the federal government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The spirit and tenacity of this club is emblematic of our community, and I would like to thank all in the club for all their hard work. At last the Twin Rivers Community Mallet Sports Club have a place to call home, and I wish them the very best for the future.
