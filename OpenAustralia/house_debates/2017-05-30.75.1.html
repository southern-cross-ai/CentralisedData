        My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure. Will the minister update the House on the government's $75 billion infrastructure investment that was announced in the budget? How will this investment program deliver major projects around the country, including in my home, the great state of Victoria, and are there any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for Goldstein, who is a very fierce champion for infrastructure, for his electorate and for his great state of Victoria, because he knows about the economic benefits that infrastructure delivers. He knows about the benefits of a commitment of over $1 billion of infrastructure for Victoria, including $500 million for regional rail, $100 million for the Geelong rail line and $100 million for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East" rel="nofollow">
          North East
         </a>
         rail line. The member for Goldstein knows full well that Melbourne presently does not have a direct rail link from the city to the airport, unlike Sydney, which has a direct rail link from the city to the airport; Brisbane, which has a direct rail link from the city to the airport; and Perth, where a direct rail link from the city to the airport is under construction. That is why the member for Goldstein supports the Turnbull government's commitment of $30 million of funding for a business case for this vitally needed link.
        </p>
        <p>
         And, of course, the member for Goldstein supports the other important elements of the Turnbull government infrastructure commitments: more than $500 million for the

          Tullamarine Freeway

         widening, and, of course, the $3 billion Victorian infrastructure package, funded fifty-fifty by the Commonwealth and Victorian governments, which was agreed in November last year and which includes a $1 billion upgrade for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_Freeway" rel="nofollow">

         to benefit the people of south-eastern Melbourne.

         I am asked if there are alternative approaches. Indeed, there are alternative approaches. There used to be a land called Conrovia, a land in which economic reality did not apply. But, Mr Speaker, I must tell you, there are many such lands on the other side of the chamber. There is a land called Albonia where ordinary rules of economic reality do not apply, where you can stand up and claim that $400 million is sufficient to build a rail link from Leppington to Western Sydney Airport, when the transport minister in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         in 2015, the first time this was announced, said, 'No, no—much more likely to be $4 billion.' Albonia is a land where every major piece of infrastructure—the

But on this side, I can tell you, economic reality does apply. We are delivering infrastructure for the people of Australia.
