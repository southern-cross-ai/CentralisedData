        I rise today to speak about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_House" rel="nofollow">
         Catherine House
        </a>
        , an organisation located in my electorate and providing accommodation and, in turn, comfort and support for women in crisis in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . It is important to recognise the services and work of such an organisation as it addresses challenges in our society that some would rather turn a blind eye to. Established in 1988 by the Sisters of Mercy, Catherine House helps over 700 women every year and refers an average of 56 women to their emergency accommodation program every month. Catherine House provides the only supported accommodation service in South Australia for women over 21 who do not have children and who have become homeless for reasons other than domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 8 October this year, I was honoured to be invited to share in the 20th birthday celebrations of Catherine House. These celebrations represent a time to pay tribute to all that Catherine House has achieved in its 20 years of service to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        women—work that has made a difference to the lives of thousands of women, often at the time of their absolute greatest need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clients of Catherine House include women with a range of what are both complex and, at times, overlapping issues. These range from domestic violence to mental illness and also include relationship breakdown, family breakdown and substance abuse. The services Catherine House provides for these women are indispensable. They include 16 houses, one emergency house and 15 transitional houses located in Adelaide’s inner city that house up to 48 clients per night. Their emergency supported accommodation program houses and works with up to 16 clients at a time. Some of these clients will stay in the program for up to a month, while those within the transitional supported accommodation program may stay for approximately 6½ months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Particular commendation should be made of the 40 staff members and more than 80 volunteers who make Catherine House’s work possible. I particularly pay tribute to Madge McGuire, the director at Catherine House, and to all of the truly amazing and truly unsung heroes of our community who support the work there. Their dedication, hard work and generosity of spirit make an enormous difference in the lives of the people they serve and they continue to make a significant contribution to the Adelaide community. I would like to acknowledge all those involved with Catherine House, from their dedicated staff and volunteers to the ordinary Australian families who support their fundraising efforts. This is a truly remarkable South Australian organisation and I commend its achievements to the parliament and wish it happy 20th birthday celebrations.
