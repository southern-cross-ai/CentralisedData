        My question is to the Minister for Health and Aged Care. How is the Albanese Labor government supporting working Australians by delivering cheaper medicines? What obstacles have stood in the way of the government delivering cheaper medicines?

         I thank the member for her question. She promised, like everyone on this side did, to make medicines cheaper to the electorate, and in just 15 months we've delivered four waves of cheaper medicines reforms. Last July we slashed the maximum amount that millions of pensioners and concession card holders would pay for all of their medicines needs in any given year by 25 per cent. I'm pleased to report to the House that, by the end of June this year, an additional 450,000 concession card holders had already qualified for free medicines compared to the same time last year—450,000 more Australians who pay nothing at all for their medicines needs for the last six months of this year.

         the second wave of our reform slashed the price of 2,000 brands of medicines, putting $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australian patients. And on 1 January, of course, we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS, slashing the maximum payment for general patients from $42 a script to just $30. And now, thanks to the fourth wave of our reforms, millions of patients will only have to pay that money six times a year instead of 12—two scripts for the price of one—effectively halving the cost of almost 100 common medicines for a range of ongoing health conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last Friday almost four million Australians qualified for 60-day scripts, and over the course of next year another two million or more Australians will also become covered, totalling six million Australian patients who will get two scripts for the price of one—good for their hip pocket, good for their health, good for the health system because it frees up millions and millions of desperately needed

         consults.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, patients should not have had to wait this long to get access to the benefits of 60-day scripts, because the former government were given exactly the same advice five years ago, and they ignored it. Five years later they have still learned nothing. They're still backing in the powerful lobby groups over the interests of patients, voting time and time again—four weeks ago in the other place—to block cheaper medicines to six million Australian patients. Even having lost that vote, within 24 hours they'd drafted another disallowance motion, to have another go at blocking cheaper medicines for six million Australian patients. This mob learn nothing—always backing the interests of other people over the interests of Australian patients. I table the motion signed by Senator Ruston and Senator McKenzie within 24 hours—

          The minister's time has concluded. If he wishes to table a document, he can do so anytime.
