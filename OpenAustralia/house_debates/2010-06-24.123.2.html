         Healthcare Identifiers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010
        </a>
        . I want to make some very short comments that can cover both of them. Today is in fact a very big occasion for the provision of health services in Australia. Today, this parliament—this House and the Senate—is passing the very first piece of legislation required to build the e-health system into the future. It is a necessary foundation stone for us to be able to establish a national e-health record system for Australia. The amendments that were passed in the other place respond to concerns expressed in the minority report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, including by moving a number of matters planned to be covered in the regulations into the legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government would like to thank the opposition and the minor parties for their support of this bill, which is an important step forward to improving the safety, quality and efficiency of health care in Australia. While it might seem very late on a very long day to be doing this, it does ensure that this can come into effect from 1 July—next week—as planned. Across the country, we, healthcare providers and others can get on with the job of building an e-health system for the future of this country. It is with great pride that I recommend the bill with these amendments and that it be agreed to.

         On behalf of the opposition, I wish to say that we agree that the unique individual healthcare identifier is an important of the architecture for e-health. We are supportive of e-health for the efficiencies, the improvements in safety and the avoidance of duplication in clinical practice that it will bring. As the minister said, there was a Senate inquiry into this and there was a minority report. The opposition took up the concerns of the coalition senators raised in the minority report and drafted eight amendments. The concerns raised in six of those amendments were taken up by government amendments. There were two further amendments that addressed function creep but, following discussions with stakeholders, with NEHTA and also with Owen from the minister’s office, I am satisfied that those two amendments would not have been workable. The opposition determined in the Senate not to proceed with those amendments. We made the decision in the Senate to support the government amendments. We think that this is an important part of establishing the infrastructure for e-health. I also note that

         has set aside $218 million for the adoption of a healthcare identifier service which runs until 30 June 2012. This money has already been allocated. Now the legislation is in place to let this go forward.
