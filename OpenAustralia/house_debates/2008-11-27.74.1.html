       <p>
        Terrorism knows no boundaries. Terrorists care for no faith or gender. Terrorists care for no country or region. Today, on behalf of the people of Ryan, I want to express my sympathy and condolences to all those in the city of Mumbai in India who were killed and all those who were terribly injured in the attacks that both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition touched on in their speeches on indulgence today in the House of Representatives. We understand that some 101 people have been killed and some 287 have been injured in the attacks. We also understand that two Australians are missing and several Australians are injured.
       </p>
       <p>
        The constituents of Ryan include hundreds and hundreds of Australians of Indian background who have come to make western Brisbane home, and I take this opportunity to salute their wonderful contribution to the community of Ryan, the city of Brisbane, the state of Queensland and this great country, Australia. I very strongly condemn the evil, barbaric terrorist activities that took place. They showed the dark side of humanity. We condemn this, but, more particularly, we mourn for those families that have lost fathers, mothers or children.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Leader of the Opposition said, India is a country which we have so many common and enduring ties with. Of course, we share a British heritage. We share a love of cricket and we share a priceless belief in the power of democracy. India is the world’s largest democracy. It is a nation of one billion-plus people. India and China, are the two countries on the planet that have more than a billion people. So India is a country of immense significance, not only to the future prosperity of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" rel="nofollow">

        region but to the prosperity of the world. It is a country of remarkable history, culture and tradition. Our nation must continue to work together with India to do all we can to bring about peace, stability and security and to give people less fortunate than ourselves opportunities to make the most of their lives and to enjoy all the fruits that so many people in developed economies enjoy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that the 52,000-plus students in Australia who are from India will be mourning the loss of lives of their fellow citizens. Many students of Indian background are studying at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Lucia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , in the Ryan electorate. They have made St Lucia and the suburbs surrounding the University of Queensland their temporary home while they study in our country. I say to them: ‘My thoughts are with you. Perhaps some of you are from Mumbai. Perhaps some of you have, in fact, lost loved ones. I share your outrage, but I also share your loss and the deep pain that you will feel.’
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take this opportunity to say thank you to a constituent of mine, Mrs Das, who is of Indian heritage. She very generously and very warmly hosted so many Australians of Indian and non-Indian descent last Sunday evening at her home to celebrate Diwali, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Light" rel="nofollow">
         Festival of Light
        </a>
        . It is an occasion that is so important in the Indian calendar: a celebration of Indian culture, a celebration of Indian success and a celebration of all that is good in life—hence the translation to Festival of Light. She is a lady who recently lost her dear husband, Dr Das, a man of remarkable ability who had the great respect of the Ryan community. He was a medical doctor, a man of global outlook, a man who lived a global life. He recently passed away. We celebrated his life on that occasion last Sunday evening as well. He is an inspiration to so many in the western suburbs of Brisbane.
