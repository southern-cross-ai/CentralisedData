       <p>
        My constituents, particularly those living in Drummoyne, are crying out for relief from aircraft noise. While noise is inevitable in take-off and landing corridors, this issue again brings into sharp focus the need for a second airport for Sydney.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_noise" rel="nofollow">
         Aircraft noise
        </a>
        is increasing for more than a million residents in the inner suburbs of Sydney, particularly in my electorate of Reid, and this must be addressed now.
       </p>
       <p>
        I concur with the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and member for Grayndler who said last year that Sydney needs a second airport sooner rather than later and that without action the national economy will be constrained with a negative impact on growth and jobs. The suggestion from the Tourism and Transport Forum that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Airport
        </a>
        should be allowed to grow further in order to overcome the impending lack of capacity is outrageous and a monumental betrayal of the people I represent in this place. Any attempt to increase aircraft movements at Sydney Airport beyond the cap of 80 movements per hour will be over my dead body. Moreover, any attempt to alter the curfew will lead to a revolution by my constituents as well as those in neighbouring electorates.
       </p>
       <p>
        My constituents, and those of my colleague and neighbour the minister for transport, have carried the burden of aircraft noise for far too long, and we have had enough. The Tourism and Transport Forum and like-minded proponents of the expansion of Sydney Airport should be flogged. Moreover, New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell's push today for Canberra to be Sydney's second airport is pie in the sky and is an unambiguous message to my constituents that the Liberal Party will never support a site for a second Sydney airport that works.

        , too, should be flogged.
