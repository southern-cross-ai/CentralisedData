        I rise to confirm the commitments of a Shorten federal Labor government to my electorate of Solomon. A Shorten federal Labor government will deliver for Darwin and Palmerston. Already we've seen a $14 million commitment to public schools in my electorate, which is going to be fantastic for every primary and high school student. The schools really need that extra funding, and I am very proud that federal Labor has committed that funding to schools—to the kids and families of the

        A Shorten Labor government will invest $220 million in infrastructure and community development projects to dramatically improve the infrastructure in

        </a>
        , to make sure that it continues to be a prime tourist destination, and secure the future of the township of Jabiru. After the budget, Territorians woke up a bit disappointed this morning to see that it's unclear where there's any commitment from the federal government to Kakadu National Park. In contrast, Labor will invest $100 million to upgrade four key access roads; $44 million for environmental and national park infrastructure upgrades; $25 million for a new Kakadu visitor and world heritage interpretive centre in Jabiru; and $2.5 million to improve mobile connectivity in the park. Kakadu National Park is a very important part of our tourism offering but it's also where we are able to see over $60,000 of history and culture in our country—the

        A Shorten Labor government will also invest in the health and wellbeing of our veterans in the

This will also provide services to our first responders and, when they need it, to our currently serving people who may or may not be veterans. This veterans and servicemen and servicewomen support hub will be dedicated to providing support to our current and ex-serving Defence personnel. We've committed $4.9 million, and this centre will be a place where people can go to connect, meet, relax, speak with someone about any issues they might be having, and access community, state, federal and cross-sector services. It will be a place where people can go to get a cup of tea and a chat. The hub will provide—
