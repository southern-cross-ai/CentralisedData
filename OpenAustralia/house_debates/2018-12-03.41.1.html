       <p>
        Christmas is a time for thoughtfulness and giving, a time when people go to great lengths just to see somebody else smile. That's why we've reached out to every school in Bennelong to allow the students a chance to design the cover of our annual Christmas card. We believe that children encapsulate the true excitement and nature of Christmas, and what better way to spread that than by a Christmas card designed by the children themselves?
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to everybody who participated. It was great fun to look through all of the wonderful designs. We received many spectacular, creative, clever submissions—some a little bit naughty—from students from a range of schools. But there were a few that stood out. There were four semifinalists, whose designs you can find on the back of the card, and one winner, who has won the honour of being on the front of the card. The four chosen semifinalists were Isabella Luo from the kindergarten class and Danika Senger from the year 5 class of Our Lady Help of Christians Catholic Primary School in Epping; and Ria Jane from year 2 and Georgie Telfer from year 5 at the Roselea Public School. The winner of the annual Christmas card competition, however, is Chloe Bourke from Ermington West Public School. Congratulations, Chloe, and a big thank you again to everyone who participated for bringing joy and excitement to Christmas for everyone in a small but meaningful way.
