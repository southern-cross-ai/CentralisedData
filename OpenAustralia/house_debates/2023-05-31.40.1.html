       <p>
        My community, like many across the country, is struggling because of the housing affordability crisis. There are no two ways about it. It's hard to buy a house, particularly if you're someone who has had to leave a relationship, an older woman or a younger person trying to save up, and it's hard to afford to pay rent. We on this side of the chamber know that, and that's why the minister and the Prime Minister, with the support of all of us here, have been working so hard to bring in a multipronged approach to deal with the housing affordability crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you list everything together, you realise how much work has been done, much of which is not being recognised or, in most cases, supported by other parties in this parliament. You can start with the Housing Australia Future Fund, our key election commitment of $10 billion for social and affordable housing. It is held up in the Senate by Greens and Liberals and Nationals who have no rational argument whatsoever to not support a policy which will build more housing for people who need it. We have the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council. We've established and will be rolling out a help-to-buy scheme, assisting 10,000 people a year. There is the National Housing and Homelessness Plan with the states, which has been missing, as well as increasing Commonwealth rental assistance, investing more in social affordable housing, above the future fund, and expanding the Home Guarantee Scheme's eligibility.
