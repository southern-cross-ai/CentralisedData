        noted the importance of the Jindalee Operational Radar Network and advised of the government's intention to upgrade the network. The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants, contractors and construction workers, with up to approximately 200 personnel and an average construction workforce of up to approximately 15 personnel. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $50.7 million. The committee has conducted an inquiry and considers the project to be value for money for the Commonwealth, fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for once again undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval of the proposed works, construction will commence in early 2019 and be completed by late 2020. I commend the motion to the House.

       <p>
        As advised when this project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 10 May 2018, the Department of Defence is proposing to construct and refurbish mask-testing facilities as well as storage facilities that will support chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence training and capability at 14 locations across Australia. The
        <i>
         2016 Defence white paper
        </i>
        identifies the importance of providing Defence with enhanced domestic security capabilities—including its chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence capability—to help respond to the threat of complex terrorist attacks within Australia. The works are expected to generate short-term employment opportunities, predominantly in the building, construction and labour markets, in each of the relevant locations. The works are also expected to provide opportunities for suppliers in the manufacture and distribution of construction materials and equipment. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $16.7 million, excluding
