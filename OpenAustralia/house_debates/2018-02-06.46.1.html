        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Approximately half of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        in remote areas live in overcrowded housing, with some three bedroom homes containing 17 occupants. In contrast, only five per cent of non-Indigenous Australians live in overcrowded housing. Will the minister please provide the reasons why the federal government has abandoned the National Partnership on Remote Housing, which will mean a shortfall of $24 million for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and $483 million nationally? Defunding will inevitably lead to more overcrowding and even poorer health, social and educational outcomes for remote Indigenous communities. Minister, how can this be closing the gap?

         I thank the member for her question and her interest in this particular issue. It is a matter of priority for our government and certainly has been part of a priority that has been the focus of a remote Indigenous housing agreement for the past 10 years. The negotiations that are occurring between states and territories that are part of this remote agreement require ministers from the states and territories to also equally commit and match Commonwealth funding. The funding that we provided to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         last year was $430 million for mainstream, or general, housing, but over the last nine years South Australia has received $3.3 billion. The point you make about reducing overcrowding has been a result of that continued partnership. We've seen a 15 per cent reduction in overcrowding in the four jurisdictions that are affected:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , South Australia,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         and Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         The funding has not been cut. It has not been reduced. Senator Scullion is in ongoing negotiations with the relevant ministers. Sadly, Zoe Bettison has, so far, refused to put any money on the table as part of those bilateral discussions. That is important, because there is a need to consider all Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people as part of the citizenry of each jurisdiction. Equally, there is an obligation for state and territory governments to come to the table and make their contribution in the same manner that they do for mainstream. The remote housing report has identified that another 5,500 houses are needed in all jurisdictions, but if we are to address that then there must be equal partnership between the jurisdictions and the Commonwealth, because the impact of housing is beyond just accommodation. It goes to the social determinants in which housing provides the opportunity for shelter but also the same trappings that we would expect to find in any home within our country. My colleague Senator Scullion in the other chamber is continuing to have ongoing discussions with the relevant ministers, with a view to seeking to put into place an agreement that is jointly agreed to but equally shared in meeting the needs of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         within those four jurisdictions so there is not a cutback in Commonwealth funding.
