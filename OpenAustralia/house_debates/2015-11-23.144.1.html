         The Christmas
        </a>
        spirit is alive and well in the electorate of Kingston, with many different fairs happening in my local community that are not only helping to raise money for local organisations but also bringing the community together in a way that showcases all the talent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the Cove Sports and Community Club and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallett_Cove" rel="nofollow">
         Hallett Cove
        </a>
        &amp; Districts Inc. for hosting the Cove fair. It was a great day. Many local schools students performed, as well as organisations. A great festive spirit was on display. The Hallett Cove R-12 school also held their inaugural school fair day, in which they were able to showcase a lot of the students' work and activity and also to raise money for charities. I acknowledge all the staff, teachers and parents, who put in a huge amount of effort, especially Principal Mary Asikas for her involvement on this very special day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, on the weekend just past we had the Noarlunga Football Club Christmas market. I give a big shout out to Jodie Smith and her team. This was a wonderful day where a lot of money was raised for the local community. You were able to quickly go and get your Christmas shopping done, which I did, buying a pet rock from the Moana Primary School, who showed their enterprising spirit by setting up businesses and selling a range of different products, including dream catchers, pet rocks, phone holders and other things. It is not over yet; the fairs continue. The Friends of Sully's will be hosting their Christmas fair and carols on 6 December. I give a big shout out to the Friends of Sully's, who are making this year bigger and better than ever, and I send a big thankyou particularly to Mick Allison, who is putting the work in for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is just the start of the Christmas season, with the Onkaparinga Christmas Pageant happening this weekend. I urge everyone to get down to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Beach Road
        </a>
        . It is a really wonderful day. You might even see
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Christmas" rel="nofollow">
         Father Christmas
        </a>
        at the end of that pageant. I will have my usual pageant float there. It is wonderful day for people to come down and celebrate. In addition, we will roll into the Christmas season.
       </p>
       <p>
        I put on record my big thanks to all volunteers. All these events are put on by volunteers who believe in the importance of bringing our community together and sharing that Christmas spirit. I give a big thankyou to everyone on the barbecues, everyone putting up stalls, everyone on the drink stands and everyone who comes together to make it a very special time in the electorate of Kingston.
