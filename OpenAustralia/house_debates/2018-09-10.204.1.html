       <p>
        Last month the world lost a champion. Ian 'Edna' Drake dedicated his life to the cause of the worker. His work and the work of so many others in the trade union movement has ensured we have the quality of life and working conditions so many take for granted today. With a lifetime dedicated to a fair go for workers and serving his community, Edna represented the very best of unionism. Edna joined the Boilermakers' and Blacksmiths' Society in April 1968 prior to its amalgamation into the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union—over 50 years of continuous membership and service. While working as a boilermaker, Ian served as a shop steward—delegate—for many years, as a state councillor, as a national conference delegate, as a state admin committee member and finally as a state president.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's people like Edna, who have fought their entire working life, that I take inspiration from. He stood up and campaigned for a fair and equitable Tasmania, universal health care, great education and training, and dignity in retirement. Edna represented hundreds of workers in all areas of manufacturing around Tasmania, including food and confectionary; metal and engineering; printing, design and packaging; technical, laboratory, supervisory and administrative; and vehicle building, service and repair.
       </p>

        I want to take this opportunity to express my condolences to Edna's family, friends and comrades. As to how he got the name 'Edna', apparently it was so long ago that nobody really remembers the story. But he did have an Aunt Edna, who he was very close to and who would keep him very well stocked with cakes and goodies. And that's a very good reason to have that as your namesake. Vale, Ian 'Edna' Drake.
