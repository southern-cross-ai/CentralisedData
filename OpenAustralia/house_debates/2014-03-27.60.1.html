       <p>
        My local community was devastated to hear last Saturday that Glenn Norman, a senior firefighter at the Woodridge fire station in my electorate, was tragically taken in an aviation accident following a lifelong passion for skydiving. My heart goes out to those who Glenn leaves behind: Linda, his wife of 31 years, and Sarah and Megan, his daughters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Glenn started his career as an apprentice mechanic with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        government in 1976 but moved his family to Queensland in 1994 to start a new career as a firefighter. This was a perfect position for someone with such a passion for helping the broader community. Progressing through to senior firefighter, Glenn became a mentor to many, with an ability to develop and nurture new recruits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Glenn's passion for skydiving saw him take over 10,000 jumps. He was a proficient tandem instructor and a student freefall instructor. He was well known in the skydiving community as being loyal, honest, and a brilliant teacher. He was a passionate advocate for the local community. Active in many charities, he used his other passion of cycling to assist many through various charity rides.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our local firies are such an important part of our communityâ€”and every community. Glenn was a man with a passion for ensuring we look out for each other and look after each other. He will be sorely missed, not only by those he worked with at Woodridge fire station in my electorate but by all whose lives were touched by his integrity, honesty and generosity.
