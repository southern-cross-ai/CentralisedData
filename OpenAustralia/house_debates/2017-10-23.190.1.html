       <p>
        I rise today to pay tribute to two extraordinary women who have sadly left this earth: Neta Yallop and Linda Beattie. Both women were extremely important to the electorates of Barton and Canterbury.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neta Yallop passed away peacefully on 2 August 2017, aged 93. Throughout her life, Neta made a tremendous contribution to her local community. I knew Neta well and her late husband, Ted. She served as a board member of Earlwood childcare centre for 40 years, championing support for vulnerable families and children with disabilities. For over 60 years she was a volunteer at the Canterbury City Community Centre, formerly the Canterbury Community Aid Bureau. She was a founding member and subsequently served as president and vice-president. In 2015 she was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        as part of the Queen's honours list for her 60 years service to Canterbury. After a lifetime of community service, may she rest in peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to mention the late Linda Beattie, a wonderful woman who died on 19 August 2017. She was 67. Linda was an actor and a model and ran many productions in Sydney's renowned theatre scene. She was a dedicated Labor member and supported me in the last election campaign. She had insurmountable odds, but she was always full of life and never once complained. She was full of passion and flare. I pay tribute to her dear friend Daryl Burge-Lopez as well. Both women will be sorely missed.
