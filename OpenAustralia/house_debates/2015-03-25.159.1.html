        celebrations which occurred on 21 March—an annual celebration of Australia's cultural diversity which is about inclusiveness, respect and a sense of belonging for everyone. Harmony Day coincides with the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This year we celebrate 15 years of Harmony Day.

Over one-third of our residents were born overseas and, of those born overseas, 86 per cent come from non-English-speaking backgrounds. The day brought together former Socceroos Craig Foster,

        The day saw the former Socceroos and SBS All Stars take on the John Fawkner College and the Melbourne City Football Academy for the One Goal, One Community Cup, which was kindly donated by Pascoe Vale Soccer Store. The game was played in great spirit. The SBS All Stars took out the cup in a tight-fought 3-2 contest, with the young John Fawkner side relishing the experience to play against the former top flight players, as well as my own staffer Anthony Cianflone, who, despite much talk, could not keep a clean sheet in goals for the SBS All Stars.

        The game was followed by a junior football clinic hosted by the Futsal Oz centre in Brunswick, with star futsal V-League players hosting the clinic. The day was an outstanding success, with over 200 residents attending and with many official partners and supporters, whom I would like to thank, in particular, SBS; John Fawkner Secondary College and Principal Gus Napoli; Melbourne City Football Club; Moreland City Council; Moreland Youth Services; oxYgen project;

        Football can play an important role to help build community, cultural understanding, inclusion, respect and resilience. I hope to be able to host the One Goal, One Community Cup day again in 2015, ideally in the newly built state-of-the-art football facilities at
