        I would like to take this opportunity to provide the chamber with an update on the much-needed upgrade to the notorious Lindum crossing at Lytton. Just last week I received an email from one of my constituents, Harrison, who sent me dashcam footage of yet another miss with a semitrailer at this rail level crossing. Unfortunately, this is a daily occurrence, and every day this project is delayed the lives of motorists and pedestrians are put at risk. While I have delivered $400,000 towards the Lindum station precinct study, and a further $85 million to get this project underway, the Queensland Labor government has yet to commit project funding for this desperately needed upgrade. However, I am pleased to advise that the study by

        , which has been underway for months now, is starting to move forward, with technical investigations now underway. Following the public consultation period, we found that a safer level crossing, increased car parking and improved pedestrian and bike access were some of the top priorities identified. Local knowledge plays a crucial role in delivering the best outcome for the Lindum crossing rail upgrade. While we know this intersection is dangerous, the public consultation will help determine the best solutions for all. Thank you to everyone who has shared their ideas and completed the survey.

        As the local member, community safety is my top priority. I fought for this project over many years. I ran a petition, which gained more than 7,000 signatures, and successfully lobbied for the $85 million in funding.

        has also come to the party, with $40 million for this project. The only level of government holding this up now is the Queensland Labor government.

        This level crossing and fiveways intersection is a never-ending nightmare for motorists during peak hour. It needs to be fixed as soon as possible. The study is currently looking at a variety of options to make this happen, including grade separation, upgrading the level crossing and relocating the level crossing. This project will also consider station and parking upgrades. After three years of lobbying, petitioning and securing funding for the Lindum crossing upgrade, I look forward to hopefully welcoming a funding commitment by the Queensland Labor government. The safety of rail commuters, pedestrians and motorists depends on all levels of government working together. While
