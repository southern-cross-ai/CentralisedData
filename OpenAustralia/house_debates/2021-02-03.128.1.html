        in recognition of his over 40 years of service to the brigade. He is the Central Coast group captain and has assisted with numerous local incidents, including major bushfires. During the 2019-20 bushfire season, he led the forward operational response for the Three Mile fire to protect properties at Kulnura, Mangrove and Spencer, and he's been a member of the District Senior Management Team for over 25 years. I really do thank him for his tireless work and leadership. Meals on Wheels volunteer Paula Hardwick received Citizen of the Year. She has assisted the organisation for over 20 years and recently increased her volunteering to several days a week to ensure some of the most vulnerable members of our community have nutritious meals and crucial social support during COVID-19.

       <p>
        It's this commitment to supporting those less fortunate that really epitomises the Australian spirit, and I want to congratulate each and every one of those worthy recipients. Your service, your dedication and commitment to our community has really helped to make the Central Coast the very best region in the very best country in the world.
