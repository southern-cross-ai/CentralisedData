        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the House record its deep regret at the death on 27 April 2008 of Lance Corporal Jason Marks while on combat operations in Afghanistan and place on record its appreciation of his service to the country and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to place before the House our sorrow as a parliament, as a government and as a nation at the death of Lance Corporal Jason Marks while on combat operations in Afghanistan. I want to repeat here my expression of deep condolence to his wife, Cassandra, to their two children, Connor and Ella, and to his parents, Paul and Sharon. I also want to tender my sympathy to the extended family and friends of Lance Corporal Marks, including his fellow service men and women. On behalf of the Australian government and all members of the House, I offer our prayers and our support to his family and friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lance Corporal Marks was a loving father and husband. He was also highly respected by his peers and renowned for his dedication and enthusiasm for his job. He led a distinguished career in the Army, rising to the esteemed position of a commando in the 4th Battalion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        . He deployed to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        and Afghanistan on more than one occasion. He received numerous service medals and was awarded a unit citation for gallantry in 2006.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just before Christmas, I visited Iraq and Afghanistan. I had the great privilege of meeting some of Australia’s service men and women deployed to the region. These men and women display extraordinary strength of character and courage. They are dedicated to serving their country and to lending assistance to those who need it most. The people serving in our defence forces are deployed to provide security, to protect civilians from harm and to contribute to rebuilding countries scarred by war and civil unrest. Our soldiers deployed to Afghanistan are making a significant contribution to the region. They are working with coalition partners and the government of Afghanistan to rebuild the country and provide security for its people. There are hard and difficult times ahead, but we must remain committed to our mission.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Anzac Day, I spoke of the Australian traditions of courage, of fighting for freedom and of fighting for the common good. This tradition is a part of who we are as a nation, but it comes at a terrible cost—and a personal cost. Lance Corporal Marks made a significant contribution to securing peace and nation building in East Timor and Afghanistan, and he did this in a difficult and dangerous operating environment. Lance Corporal Marks lost his life serving his nation with courage and with honour. His sacrifice will not be forgotten. Just over two weeks ago, on Anzac Day, we paused to remember those who had fought for their country and made the ultimate sacrifice. It is with great sadness that today we pause again as a mark of respect to Lance Corporal Marks and honour his service to the Australian nation.

         I join the Prime Minister in offering the condolences of the opposition at the death of Lance Corporal Jason Marks. He was killed on 28 April while wearing the uniform of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         as a 4RAR commando. He was 27. He leaves behind his parents, Paul and Sharon, his wife, Cassie, and his two children, Connor and Ella. We should also remember, in reflecting on his life and his service, that there were four other Australian soldiers who were wounded in the same battle in Oruzgan, Afghanistan, with small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lance Corporal Marks was born in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill" rel="nofollow">
          Broken Hill
         </a>
         . He grew up in Yeppoon. As Cassie, his wife, said of him, he had dreamt of being a soldier since the age of 12. He finally achieved his dream in 1999, when he joined the Australian Army. He first saw his way through the

          Royal Australian Army Medical Corps
         </a>
         and finally achieved his ambition of becoming a commando, very much the elite of the Australian Army. In the days after his death, every Australian should remember that he is the fourth Australian who has died in Afghanistan over the last six months. He joins

         and

          David Pearce
         </a>
         as Australians—Australian men, Australian soldiers—who gave their lives in our name, on our behalf and for everything that we hold dear.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our generation is engaged in fighting a resurgent totalitarianism, the epicentre of which is in Afghanistan, which is the path and the crossroads to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia" rel="nofollow">
          Central Asia
         </a>
         . All of us should remember that 88 Australians were murdered in October 2002 by three men who trained with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan under the support and patronage of the Taliban. That is why we are there. That is why he gave his life. We are fighting people who have hijacked the name of Islam to build a violent political utopia. They are fundamentally opposed to political and religious freedom. Their attitudes to the treatment of women are incompatible with a peaceful world, let alone a civil society, and they are fundamentally opposed to the liberating power of education because it most seeks to undermine the dogma to which they have signed up. This country is enormously proud of Jason Marks, the sacrifice that he has made and that in particular of his family, and arguably it is the families that make the greatest sacrifice.
