        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the amendments be agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will just make some very brief remarks and indicate my appreciation to the opposition. This bill and the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill (No. 2) 2009, including as amended by the House and the Senate, address the threat of serious and organised crime groups, which we know to be increasingly aggressive, entrepreneurial and adaptive. The legislation represents a significant step as part of a coordinated national effort to more effectively prevent, investigate and prosecute organised crime activities and to improve law that targets the proceeds of organised crime groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the constructive discussions that were held with the opposition, specifically the shadow Attorney-General, during consideration of this important legislation and I thank the opposition for their support for these very important bills. I also note that the opposition proposed a number of amendments to the first of the two bills and these have been accepted by the government. I would also like to thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for its consideration of the bills. The bills demonstrate the government’s commitment to decisive action to address the threat of organised crime and to ensure that there are no safe havens in Australia for organised crime groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
