        I rise today to draw attention to the fact that Saturday, 9 September is International
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASD" rel="nofollow">
         FASD
        </a>
        Awareness Day. FASD, or fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, is a lifelong disability which children can be born with after exposure to alcohol during pregnancy. This exposure primarily affects the functioning of the brain, resulting in damage to a child's motor skills, cognition, language development, memory and impulse control. This has significant implications for their future. FASD, as we know, is preventable, and the journey to end FASD starts today. We don't need new drugs or advances in safety equipment; what we need is strong government commitment to tackling the issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2012, the House Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs considered the issue in depth. Sadly, however, many of its recommendations have not been implemented. FASD adversely affects families and communities across this country. We must do more. We must support those with FASD by allowing them to access the National Disability Insurance Scheme and by helping their parents and carers. We must do better to prevent FASD from occurring. One in four women in Australia continue to drink even after they are aware that they're pregnant. We must ensure that all women receive accurate information and advice from their health professionals, and support from family and friends. We must all be heroes for children by encouraging alcohol-free pregnancies. I invite you all to join me in recognising FASD this Saturday.
