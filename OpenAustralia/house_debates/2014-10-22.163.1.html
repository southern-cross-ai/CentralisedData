        Today I want to sing the praises of a young woman from the electorate of Chifley, because that is what she does in spectacular fashion. Marlisa Punzalan is a singer of extraordinary talent—so much so that she literally overcame the odds on national television on Monday night to win Channel 7's

        2014 talent competition. When you see what she has achieved, and bear in mind that she is still a 15-year-old schoolgirl from Glendenning, you will appreciate her capacity to inspire her peers and all young people across Australia—especially the ones who want to break free from their inhibitions and, as in her case, acute shyness. There is no doubt that they can break free from this. Marlisa Punzalan, who has excited many—regardless of background—by the prospect of all of the great things that lie ahead of her, is representative of a new generation of

        s, many of whom I am proud to represent in this place. Her success prompts me to reflect on generations of

        I was at an event on the weekend that reminded me of this—the Sydney Australian-Filipino Seniors Inc annual celebrations, where every year they reflect on another year of achievement. This group has been going strong for 27 years, where some groups struggle to last 27 months. They are headed up by president Virginia Atienzo, and many of the other past presidents and committee members were there. I think the key to SAFSI's success reflects great traits in individual Filipinos, particularly their love of family and their eagerness to work as a group for the betterment of many other families, neighbours and the community at large. On Sunday when I cast an eye around a packed auditorium of about 400 people—young and old—you could recognise people who were not just active in SAFSI, but were contributing actively within other groups. I mentioned a number of those people on the day, but I wanted to take the opportunity to single out Woodcroft's Chris Pilao.

        Chris's contributions span a variety of local activities. For instance, he and fellow resident and friend Lucas Cayanan have been members of the organising committee that puts together the annual Woodcroft Festival. This year it celebrated 10 years of the festival. A veteran himself, Chris spearheads the Australian-Philippine Services League, representing veterans of various areas of conflict, including Korea, Fiji, Lebanon, Vietnam, Mindanao—former service personnel of the armed force of the Philippines in the ADF and their descendants.

        has reached its own terrific milestone with 10 years of continued service this year. Chris can be rightly proud of the part he has played in this group's achievements. A quietly-spoken, modest man who achieves much, Chris also became the first Filipino Australian to be elected as a director of the Rooty Hill

        , one of the largest in the country. Be it Chris Pilao or Marlisa Punzalan, I see much in the ethics, spirit and devotion of Filipino Australians that makes me very proud, and makes many other Australians very proud. Congratulations on your great success.
