       <p>
        by leaveâ€”I wish to inform the House that our ambassador in Indonesia has informed me that the

         Indonesian Supreme Court
        </a>
        has today accepted
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Rush" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Rush
        </a>
        's appeal against his death sentence and has instead sentenced him to life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians will greet this decision with relief. The Australian government welcomes this decision by the Supreme Court. It is a bipartisan policy in this country that we oppose the death penalty. The government remains in close touch with Mr Rush and his family. Mr Rush's parents have been informed. His parents have shouldered a heavy burden over these years of waiting.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are, of course, two other Australians on death row in Indonesia, and Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran have also launched judicial appeals against their death sentences. We will continue to provide consular support to both men and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having spoken to the Rush family, who come from Brisbane, on a number of occasions over a period of time, I am sure the family will welcome this decision with great relief.

        <p>
         I rise to support the comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the news on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Rush" rel="nofollow">
          Scott Rush
         </a>
         , one of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_Nine" rel="nofollow">
          Bali Nine
         </a>
         , who was convicted of drug trafficking and whose appeal to reduce the penalty from death to life imprisonment has, as we understand it, now been successful.
        </p>
        <p>
         Scott Rush was a young man, aged 19, at the time. It was his first visit to Bali, but he had a somewhat troubled past. If ever a lesson was needed for people to understand that, whatever we might think of the judicial system or the penalties in place, we must abide by the laws of other countries then this is it. I note that at the time of his sentencing Scott Rush put up on a website these words:
        </p>
        <p>
         I apologise for bringing shame on Indonesia and Australia, my parents, family and friends. I am very, very sorry for my actions. I know many people have been hurt by illegal drugs, such as my parents, and people who take illegal drugs, and I am so sorry. I did say all this publicly in court.
        </p>
        <p>
         He is a young man who has learned a very harsh lesson. Our thoughts are with his family and his friends. However harsh it may seem to Australians, we welcome this decision of the Indonesian courts.
