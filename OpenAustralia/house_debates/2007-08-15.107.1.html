       <p>
        I rise today to raise serious concerns I have over community safety, especially for Australiaâ€™s senior citizens. In particular, I want to draw to the attention of the House the recent assault on Mrs Rachael Williams, who is one of my constituents. At 91, Mrs Williams is a long-time resident of Broadmeadows. Mrs Williams has lived in the same house, in Cooper Street, Broadmeadows, for close to 60 years, 40 of those on her own. According to her granddaughter, whom I spoke to yesterday, she relishes the independence of having her own place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Early on Monday morning, Mrs Williams was woken by an intruder trying to rob her house and was beaten around the head several times while still in bed. She was left with multiple cuts and bruises and covered in blood. Like so many others, I was appalled when I heard the news of what had happened to Mrs Williams. This was a truly cruel, callous and senseless attack by a person who should be behind bars. Her granddaughter tells me that Mrs Williams now needs plastic surgery, given the injuries she has sustained, but that the hospital needs to first stabilise her heart, because it is believed she suffered a minor heart attack during the assault. The fact that Mrs Williams tried to fend off her attacker shows just how much of a fighter she really is. Her courage most likely saved her life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like the family of Mrs Williams, I too find this attack beyond forgiveness. It says very little about our society if an elderly resident like Mrs Williams can no longer feel safe in her own home. This is the sixth time Mrs Williams has been robbed in the last five months. What adds to the tragedy of this case is that Mrs Williams now faces the prospect of losing her home and her independence. For Mrs Williams, as is the case for so many other elderly Australians, home is familiar. It is filled with many treasured memories of family and loved ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not the first time an elderly person has fallen victim to a violent crime and I dare say, unfortunately, it will not be the last. I am especially angry that this attack has left elderly residents in Broadmeadows worried for their own safety. This is unacceptable, particularly when, as policymakers, we are trying to provide assistance and support to elderly Australians so that, if they choose, they can stay in their own homes for as long as possible. Most elderly people prefer to do this, and I believe they should be supported to do so. We all have a responsibility to ensure that elderly Australians feel safe. The ordeal suffered by Mrs Williams reminds us exactly why this is the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        I, and also on behalf of those living in my electorate of Calwell, wish Mrs Williams all the best for a speedy recovery. I also recognise her family during this difficult time. Mrs Williams and her family have shown tremendous courage and resilience, and I want to recognise their courage in this place. They want this attack on Rachael to be made as public as possible in the hope that our community can rally in support of elderly Australians. Although not a pleasant experience, it is a timely reminder that our elderly Australians need to feel safe in their own homes. We need to find a balance between supporting the elderly to stay at home and protecting them in their home. It should be an issue of concern for all of us: family, community and governments.
