       <p>
        Just last week I had a visit in my office from two constituents who are also very good friends of mine—Julie and Cas. They came to talk about how important marriage equality is to them and also to share the very exciting news that they had just gotten married in the United States. Cas was born in America, and they had just returned from Florida, where the wedding took place. It was wonderful to hear all about the planning and the actual wedding day; it looked like such a beautiful ceremony. One of the most exciting aspects for them was the fact that they received a congratulatory message from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
         President Obama
        </a>
        . They have asked me to read that message:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Congratulations to you on your wedding day. May this special time be blessed with love, laughter, and happiness. We wish you all the best as you embark on your journey together, and we hope your bond grows stronger with each passing year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sincerely,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama" rel="nofollow">
         Barack Obama
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama" rel="nofollow">
         Michelle Obama
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        This meant so much to them—the President of the United States endorsing and congratulating them on being married.
       </p>
       <p>
        They contrast this with the current situation in Australia and simply cannot understand why the Prime Minister does not support marriage equality and their right to marry here. This is a very important issue in my electorate, and one that I have been clear about. I support marriage equality and will continue to fight for my constituents and, indeed, all Australians to have the right to marry the person they love. If the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">

        can turn rainbow, then surely this House can do it too.
