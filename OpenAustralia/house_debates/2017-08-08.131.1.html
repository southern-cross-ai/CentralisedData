        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        rollout continues to be an issue of high concern to my constituents. I am pleased to have another positive update for Bonner locals. NBN Co has advised me that 21 per cent of the NBN rollout is complete in Bonner, thanks to the coalition government's revised rollout plan. Every premise in my electorate will have access to NBN services by 2020. The majority of residents and businesses in Bonner will have access within the next year. Over time, the NBN will replace most of the existing networks as the deliverer of a new service network. This means that, at the end of 2020, there will be further plans for path upgrades and speed building. This will ensure that all users in my electorate will continue to have access to the best service possible.

        Many people have been asking me about the NBN and what they should do when it reaches their door. Many of my constituents, particularly older residents, have come to me worried about how the compulsory switchover to the NBN will affect them. To help answer their questions, I recently hosted three community information sessions with representatives from NBN Co. We first visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Mile_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Eight Mile Plains
        </a>
        -Wishart area to take questions from local residents and business owners. We held two seniors information sessions for locals from the Wynnum Manly and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Gravatt" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        areas. Many attendees have told me how helpful they found these sessions. Common questions addressed included: what steps people must take to switch over to the NBN; whether extra devices are needed to be installed inside their home; and how people can check whether medical devices connected to their landline will be compatible with the NBN. Attendees also learned how they should shop around for a suitable provider in order to get the best possible broadband speeds to suit their requirements. These NBN information sessions were such a success that I will be holding another one around the Carindale-Carina area in the near future. I look forward to doing more with the NBN as it continues to roll out in my electorate.
