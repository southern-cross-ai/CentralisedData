        My question is to the Treasurer. Last year the Treasurer was critical of Labor's tobacco excise increases but today it is reported that the government is also considering an increase in the tobacco excise. Does the Treasurer still agree with himself?

         The member for McMahon seems to have caught the budget speculation bug which is going around the place. It happens every yearâ€”it runs all the way up until May. He has misquoted what the government has said about these issues. What I have said about these issues is that those opposite are always looking for higher taxes because they cannot constrain themselves on spending. They are the ones who always just cannot hold themselves back between Australians' pockets and their ambitions for higher and higher spending.

            We have the Leader of the Opposition out there saying that he was going to achieve full employment. It reminded me of the member for Lilley: 'The four surpluses I announce tonight.' I remember how all those opposite put it all in their newsletters and they sent it out far and wide promising those surpluses. This government is being very honest with the Australian people about where the budget is. If you go to our MYEFO document last year, we are very candid and we know the expenditure havoc they caused with the budget will take many, many budgets of disciplined, determined action by those on this side of the House to control. If they want to assist with that task, there are $13 billion of savings that they could pass to ensure that the budget is brought towards balance. They could pass the

            Bill today, which would ensure that we could improve productivity in the building industry. We could do that if they wanted to support the legislation. They can support other reforms. They can back the changes we have made to innovation. They can back our proposals for multinational tax avoidance, which they voted against in this place. What we have seen from those opposite is one big fat No every time we want to make savings, one big fat No every single time we put forward positive structural reforms that will support jobs and growth.
