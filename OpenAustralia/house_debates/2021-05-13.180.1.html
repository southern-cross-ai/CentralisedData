        The federal budget is consistent with the Liberal values of reward for effort, enterprise and aspiration, by providing incentives for those who are prepared to work hard and have a go. They will reap a greater share of the benefits of their endeavour. This is in stark contrast to the extreme taxation policy announced by the Leader of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        , the member for Melbourne, last night during the adjournment debate in the House, during which he clearly announced that the Australian Greens propose a one-off 50 per cent tax on the increase in wealth during the past 12 months of the most successful Australians. This is an extreme policy which belongs in a communist country, not in Australia. It goes against our Liberal values of private property rights and poses sovereign risk. We must oppose this measure.

        Joondalup city centre is the business hub of Perth's northern suburbs, a regional central business district which is still in the process of evolving to realise its full potential as a centre of digital technology globally connected with a highly skilled workforce. My commitment to the electorate is to see the greater city of Joondalup continue to grow, prosper and develop into a safe, vibrant regional city which provides locals with essential services and employment opportunities. A strong business community is required to achieve this vision. The budget supports businesses and their growth and expansion. Continuing tax incentives by the Morrison government will allow around 15,000 businesses in my electorate to write off the full value of any eligible asset purchased, such as productive machinery, office equipment, tools and commercial vehicles. Additionally, 4,400 businesses in Moore will be able to use the extended loss carryback measure to support their cash flow. This will help businesses invest more in the local economy, expand their productive capacity and create local jobs in Joondalup.
       </p>
       <p>
        A highly skilled workforce is required to build the economy. The budget increases opportunities for apprentices and trainees, with an extended and expanded JobTrainer fund supporting 500,000 new places to upskill young people. Seven hundred and eighty apprentices in Moore attending vocational education and training colleges located around the Joondalup Learning Precinct will benefit from practical on-the-job training, with expanded wage subsidies preparing the workforce of the future.
       </p>

        To maintain a high level of health care, the Morrison government is providing additional funding for vaccination; respiratory clinics; pathology, testing and tracing; and the continuation of telehealth services. The use of video or telephone conferencing technology to consult with a medical professional was novel and took some getting used to; however, many found it convenient once they became accustomed to it. In Moore, there have been 223,211 telehealth consultations through Medicare since the start of the pandemic, and these services are now being extended in the budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        The population in Perth's northern coastal suburbs is projected to grow by 70,000 in the lead-up to 2030. Over the next nine years, approximately 9,000 new residents each year will move into our region. This presents both challenges and opportunities. Proper planning is required to ensure that the necessary services and infrastructure keep up with our growing community. The budget delivers funding to meet these future needs. The growth in population presents an opportunity to grow Joondalup as a regional city. The population growth will boost consumer demand, provided that the necessary infrastructure is built to attract people into Joondalup city centre and boost the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is still much more work to be done to unlock the economic development potential of our region through road projects such as the connection of

I will continue to advocate for more federal funding for these projects, which improve the east-west connectivity between our residential suburbs and our regional economic areas.
