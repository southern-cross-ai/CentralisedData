        At the time of Steve Irwin’s death in 2005 he was one of the most recognised and respected Australian faces here in Australia and even more so right around the world. Former

        , to his credit, arranged a $6 million federal government grant to purchase 135,000 hectares in northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York" rel="nofollow">

        , preserve it as part of the national reserve system and name it the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve as a tribute to the life and conservation work of Australia’s crocodile hunter. According to the federal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Water, Heritage and the Arts, a stunning array of wildlife roams the property, including the endangered northern quoll and the great palm cockatoo. Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve is home to six highly vulnerable plant species. The nearby
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenlock_River" rel="nofollow">
         Wenlock River
        </a>
        is the richest in freshwater fish diversity of any Australian river, including speartooth sharks, sawfish and the estuarine crocodile. Of the 32 ecosystems found on the reserve, 21 are threatened. Many of these are found nowhere else in the world but in Cape York. The department of the environment says that preserving them is of global importance.

        You would assume, then, given this history, that nothing could possibly go wrong. Regrettably, this is not the case. A mining company named Cape Alumina has lodged a request to strip mine over 12,000 hectares in the western part of Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve for bauxite. The result, according to Steve Irwin’s widow,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Irwin" rel="nofollow">
         Terry Irwin
        </a>
        , will be a total loss of original biodiversity, including all vegetation and wildlife. She says regenerated trees will lack the hollows that are crucial for nesting birds, possums and goannas. She also says that removing the bauxite would dramatically change the natural water flows to the unique and fragile rainforest springs on the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve and damage the Wenlock River system.

        I want to join with my parliamentary colleague Senator Mark Furner, I want to join with the nine scientists who have submitted a detailed report on the area and I want to join with the over 217,000 people who have signed the petition to save Steve’s place in saying there should be no strip mining in Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve. In the south we have made a lot of mistakes. We have wrecked areas in the Murray-Darling Basin like the Macquarie marshes and the Coorong. I do not think they will ever be the same again. Can’t we at least learn from these sad stories and resolve to do better with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , starting with the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve? I urge the Queensland and federal governments to reject the strip mining proposal. Do it for Steve, do it for those rare fish, birds and plants, and above all do it for all those children and young people who want this area to be as beautiful in 10 years, 20 years, 100 years as it is today.
