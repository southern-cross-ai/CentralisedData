       <p>
        I would like to take the opportunity today to talk about the community that I am so proud to represent in this place. I have spent my whole life—being born, growing up, working my first job and raising my family—amongst a truly generous people.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no shortage of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Beaches" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Beaches
        </a>
        men and women who are willing to contribute their expertise, time and money to the multitude of courses that we support. Not a day goes by without a community group, a volunteer organisation or an individual contributing. I have said it time and time again: on the Northern Beaches we do not wait around for others to come and fix our problems. We roll up our sleeves and we give things a go.
       </p>
       <p>
        The South Narrabeen Surf Life Saving Club, led by President Martin Haywood, is one of these organisations. Every year since 2006 they host the Bush to Beach. Not satisfied with the enormous contribution they make to the safety of our waterways as a patrolling club, they choose to extend their knowledge and give back to a community that does not have access to beaches. Since its inception, Ken Passmore and Jack Cannons have worked tirelessly to raise funds in our community so that the Brewarrina community in remote outback
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        can bring 50 Aboriginal students and their carers to Narrabeen Beach, to familiarise them with the beach and to talk about water safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        The program aims to encourage school attendance and to reward hardworking students with a weekend at the beach. It creates a bridge between what is too often a disadvantaged present and a bleak future to a world of possibilities. After a gruelling 12-hour bus ride, the kids take boards out and play in the surf—some for the very first time. Then we all have dinner together—the annual 'Brewarrina Baked Dinner Night'—cooked by so many members of the South Narrabeen Surf Life Saving Club. This year, the day was another great success thanks to all the volunteers at the club who helped to pull it together. Thank you for inviting me to share in this wonderful opportunity to change life for the better.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are 14 fire stations in Mackellar, all run and manned by volunteer firefighters. If you think about it, that kind of dedication really defies logic. To voluntarily put yourself in danger in order to keep your community safe, without asking for anything in return, is quite extraordinary.
       </p>
       <p>
        This summer has seen record heatwaves around New South Wales, with plenty of days being declared total fire bans. On every one of those days there is a team of dedicated residents that stands ready to brave the heat and face the very real danger of a bushfire. These teams are known as Toban crews.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our brave firefighters are of course also supported by a multitude of volunteers playing crucial parts behind the scenes, from feeding the firefighters in the fire stations to manning the communication channels that are vital to keeping our community safe. On behalf of the whole community I thank them for their efforts, and I look forward to meeting each and every one of them during their upcoming

        The Avalon Soccer Club is a treasured organisation within the Northern Beaches community. In recent times, under the dedicated Presidency of John Kowtan, the Avalon Soccer Club has grown to over 1,100 players. With such growth comes a need for improved facilities. The club's home ground at Careel Bay Playing Fields is home to seven mini fields. However, like many sporting facilities across this country, those fields are closed if it even looks like raining.
       </p>
       <p>
        The drainage on the mini fields needs fixing, fencing around the playing fields needs installing and barrier netting to prevent stray soccer balls being lost in adjacent mangroves needs erecting. Earlier this year, I voiced my concerns with the Northern Beaches Council to fight for drainage, fencing and barrier netting for the Avalon Soccer Club. I am pleased to announce that, today, the Northern Beaches Council committed to me that the drainage will be fixed by September this year, that the feasibility of further barrier netting is being investigated in consultation with the soccer club and that fencing will be installed in the coming 12 months. This is a great result for a great community organisation like the Avalon Soccer Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage all community organisations to contact me if they have issues they need help with. I am here to help and will always do my best to fight for you on the things that can make your lives better.
       </p>

        The West Pittwater Community Association was created to protect the unique character, culture and environment of West Pittwater in Mackellar. By providing a collective voice and protecting the environment, the West Pittwater Community Association ensures their members are part of a balanced and happy community. I am hoping to be of service to the association and community in West Pittwater by helping secure funding for an additional and badly needed power connector. It is my honour to support an association that envisions a supportive community, where civic pride is encouraged and promoted, where interest in community affairs is fostered and where there is ultimately goodwill amongst residents. The West Pittwater Community Association gets involved and actively seeks to protect our local fauna and flora. It also plays an essential role when it comes to securing both public and private property, such as the local wharves and reserves in the area.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Vale_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Mona Vale Hospital
        </a>
        Auxiliary comprises a group of women who you do not want to mess with. They tirelessly dedicate their energy to helping improve services for patients at the Mona Vale Hospital. Under the leadership of president Noma Moran and vice-presidents Gail Carew and Kay Tomsett, the group continues to thrive and actively engages their members. They staff the kiosk at the hospital, they assist in the Assessment and Rehabilitation Unit and new Beachside Rehabilitation Unit, they run raffles, they man stalls, they organise fashion parades—the list goes on and on. For over 50 years all members of the auxiliary have contributed to the best of their abilities, be it by knitting, crocheting, sewing or baking goods to raise money for the hospital. Every cent they raise goes towards purchasing equipment for those who have suffered bad health. It is quite incredible. Never complaining, they quietly contribute to the community. They are an inspiration to all who see a problem and just keep walking: if you stop, find the right people and give it a go, chances are you will find a solution. I thank all those who have supported and continue to support the group and their committee for their commitment to the Northern Beaches. As I said, they are not an easy group of people to say no to.

        premiership a shake. Over the last decade, our Manly Sea Eagles have done us proud, being one the most successful clubs in the NRL. Manly has made the finals in eight of the last 10 seasons, appearing in four grand finals and winning two. Delving deeper though, Manly really should have been awarded a third premiership, were it not for the member for Melbourne's club's misdeeds. It appears that, for a brief period of time, the Melbourne Storm's numbers just did not add up—kind of like the policies of the Greens party.
