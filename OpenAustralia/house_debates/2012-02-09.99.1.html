        I rise this afternoon to inform the parliament about the positive action being taken by the federal Labor government in the electorate of Bass. I am so proud of the Gillard government's support for so many different facets of the Bass community. For instance, we have invested $70 million into local schools in the last four years. Mr Speaker, you should see the great new library at East Launceston Primary School, the wonderful undercover courtyard at Invermay Primary School and the fantastic new language centre at Scottsdale High School. A further $8 million commitment has seen trade training centres open in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        and Scottsdale High Schools, and a third trade training centre, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Patrick's College
        </a>
        in Launceston, is underway. This is a fantastic commitment to local secondary students, who will have access to state-of-the-art training facilities and who will be able to acquire the skills they need for a trades career.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bass" rel="nofollow">
         The Bass
        </a>
        electorate has the Green Skills Centre for Excellence at the Alanvale Campus of the Skills Institute—with $6.4 million from the federal Labor government—and more than $5.8 million has been provided for Tasmanian Polytechnic's Sustainable Tourism and Hospitality Training Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Between 1997 and 2007, the former coalition government spent $4.4 billion on education infrastructure. This compares to the Labor government's spending of $16.2 billion in just the last four years, thereby maintaining employment across the country and transforming the learning experience for Australian students. The Gillard government has invested more than $160.9 million into Bass for health. Compare this to the piddling $32.31 million from the former government—an amazing additional $128 million from Labor. As well, $3.3 million went to the Windsor Park Multipurpose Community, Leisure and Wellbeing Centre project, and there were grants towards the infrastructure for five improved medical practices. We have delivered 54 new social housing units in Ravenswood, for the Door of Hope and the Thyne Building. Bass has been the recipient of TQUAL grants, Veteran and Community Grants and numerous volunteer grants. The government has also invested in vital water infrastructure in the north-east of Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal Labor government has committed $18.7 million for the Scottsdale Defence Science and Technology Organisation upgrade. The coalition talked about this investment for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSTO" rel="nofollow">
         DSTO
        </a>
        for 11 years, but never delivered. These projects link food production and innovation, food technology, food industry training and service delivery. Forty projects have been funded under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, including $4.2 million for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Aurora Stadium
        </a>
        , which many of you might know as being the home of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tassie_Hawks" rel="nofollow">
         Tassie Hawks
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        There are another nine projects nearing completion in Bass and I look forward to seeing the benefits these various developments will bring to the electorate. We have committed $11.5 million for flood levees and I remain committed to the long-term health of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_River" rel="nofollow">
         Tamar River
        </a>
        . In 2010 the Liberal candidate secured a promise of $2.5 million for superficial silt removal in the Tamar River. I ask: is this money part of the Liberals' $70 billion black hole or is it just another hollow pledge by the Liberal Party that it has no hope of funding? The new fly-in candidate for Bass, a bureaucrat from Canberra, claims credit for the $2.5 million which was negotiated by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Titmus" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Titmus
        </a>
        . Compare this to the $11.5 million from Labor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bass is a fantastic electorate and one of the best parts of Australia, and I am proud to represent it. I am pleased the member for Indi has enjoyed her stay in Northern Tasmania. I welcome anyone to come and visit and to enjoy our great Tassie hospitality.
