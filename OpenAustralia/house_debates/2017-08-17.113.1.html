        I rise to update the House on some much appreciated federal investment in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         O'Connor
        </a>
        . Last week I opened the Cranbrook Community Hub, which received $300,000 in National Stronger Regions funding to leverage $1.3 million of investment to create an incredible multipurpose facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 1 September, I will be opening the revamped Tambellup Sports Pavilion, which received over $900,000 in National Stronger Regions funding. The Tambellup sports ground is where I played many a game of football, and I look forward to sharing the dais with one of Tambellup's favourite sons, Richard Goyder. While Richard may not have made his mark as a footy player, he has undoubtedly kicked plenty of goals in the fields of business and philanthropy, and is now the chairman of the

        .

       <p>
        O'Connor has scored more wins in round 1 of the Building Better Regions Fund, receiving over $13.5 million, which will leverage over $37 million worth of investment. One of the projects I am most proud of is a nine-shire collaboration, the Great Southern Housing Initiative, which will receive a massive $10 million to co-fund the construction of 79 housing units across the region. I congratulate the shires of Broomehill-Tambellup, Cranbrook, Gnowangerup, Jerramungup, Katanning, Kent, Kojonup, Plantagenet and Woodanilling, for addressing the economic challenges of providing accommodation in our smaller shires. This grant will fund the construction of 43 units for independent seniors and 36 units for regional employees. Keeping our ageing family members in the regions is always a challenge, so I am thrilled that our valued senior citizens will be able to remain living in the communities they have contributed to all their lives. Quality housing is also very much needed to attract and retain skilled professionals in our smaller towns. The commercial return on rental properties is often insufficient to generate private investment for new builds, so I am pleased to see the federal government giving our shires a hand to alleviate some of the housing shortages in the bush.

        In the beautiful south west region of O'Connor, we have been fortunate to receive funding for two projects that will drive tourist visitation and grow the regional economy. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Collie" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Collie
        </a>
        has received $74,131 towards creating a truck stop toilet and recreational vehicle dump point. Collie is an important regional transport link for bringing our fabulous O'Connor produce to port, so it is important our truckies can rest and recharge on their long journeys. Collie is also a growing tourist destination for campers and caravaners, and this dump point is the final requirement for Collie to become an accredited

        -friendly town.

        In the heart of our magnificent Southern Forests, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Manjimup" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Manjimup
        </a>
        has secured a massive $2.7 million toward their South West Energy Experience. This facility will incorporate a museum which will showcase the history of power generation in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        dating back to the 19th century. It will also include a cafe, a function centre and a visitor centre. The total cost of the project is almost $6 million, and it will provide a fantastic new tourist experience and encourage exploration and enjoyment of the surrounding historic towns, quality wineries and magnificent forests. These Building Better Regions Fund projects continue the government's strong record of investment in the south west, with Manjimup previously receiving $1.6 million in NSRF funding toward the Manjimup Wellness and Respite Community Centre.

        The town of Williams forms the northern gateway of O'Connor for those travelling along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Albany Highway
        </a>
        . I drive through Williams often, as do another 4,000 vehicles every day. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Williams
        </a>
        has received $360,000 for the Williams Lions Park redevelopment project. This $774,000 project will refurbish and enlarge the all-ages playground and upgrade the ablution facilities in the heart of the town. This will encourage travellers to stop, relax and recharge to combat driver fatigue. For families like mine with young kids, it's an opportunity to get out of the car, have a bit of a break and spend a little extra time, and money, in the town. That's what this program is all about—driving economic activity and bringing more people into our regional towns.

        Last but not least, it was great to see the Goldfields town of Norseman receive nearly $450,000 to co-fund a cultural, visitor and community precinct. Norseman is at the junction of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyre_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Eyre Highway
        </a>
        and the Esperance Goldfields Highway, with over 500 vehicles a day—182,000 per year—stopping in Norseman to rest and refuel. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Dundas" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Dundas
        </a>
        has seized the opportunity to create a precinct that will capitalise on their beautiful woodlands, rich Ngadju culture and Goldfields history, and make Norseman an attractive tourist destination, not just a thoroughfare. This is a project that will certainly drive economic growth in the region. I call on the WA Minister for Regional Development,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alannah_MacTiernan" rel="nofollow">
         Alannah MacTiernan
        </a>
        , to commit to funding the other 50 per cent of these projects, which had been committed by the previous state government. If we don't get that money, the $37 million worth of projects will not be going ahead.
