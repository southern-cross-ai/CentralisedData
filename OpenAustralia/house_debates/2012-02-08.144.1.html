         Australia Day
        </a>
        is a special occasion on our nation's calendar. Apart from celebrating nationhood, it also symbolises our coming together and celebrating what we have in common. The events that marked Australia Day throughout my diverse electorate put on display the benefits and success of multiculturalism. They also provided an opportunity to recognise and thank some of the outstanding members of our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that multiculturalism's success in south-west Sydney did not happen by chance; it happened through the commitment of places such as the Cabramatta Community Centre and people like its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , Jan Collie, who have worked hard to achieve tolerance, respect and inclusion. In recognition of her dedication and commitment to the centre since 1985, Jan was awarded the Fairfield Citizen of the Year award. I was also proud of a young Chinese-Australian lad who was recognised as Young Citizen of the Year for Fairfield, Adrian Wong. He is a part of my team and works for me, and as a young Chinese-Australian he has demonstrated huge talents in working in a multicultural community. Undoubtedly Adrian is one of our future leaders. Another young role model, Hayden Mathews, was recognised for his exceptional achievements in sport.

        also recognised a number of individuals who made exceptional contributions to their community. Bob Grimson was named the Citizen of the Year for his selfless contribution to the Liverpool community through his long association with the Lions and Leo clubs as well as the Liverpool Girl Guides and the Liverpool Bicentenary Committee. Two exceptional young individuals were awarded the Liverpool Young Citizen of the Year awards—Wade Fitton for his dedicated work on a number of youth committees and as a prominent boxing coach, and Nina Zawity for her hard work on the Liverpool Youth Council—particularly in the area of empowering young people from diverse backgrounds. The Young Adults Disabled Association was recognised for its ongoing commitment to the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate all those recipients of citizen of the year awards who have been recognised for their long and significant contributions to our local community, as well as all those new Australians who took out citizenship at the ceremonies I attended in Fairfield and Liverpool. I am proud to represent a community which is so strong and cohesive and understands the real value of mutual respect, tolerance and inclusion. I congratulate all those involved.
