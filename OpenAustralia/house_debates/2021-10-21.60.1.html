        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the Morrison-Joyce government is getting on with the job of building essential water infrastructure that is creating jobs and supporting a strong economic recovery for Australians living in regional communities?

         I thank the honourable member for Mallee for her question and note the marvellous work, especially on things such as the South West Loddon Pipeline, which has been a vital piece of infrastructure for her area. I note that, even in the local media, it was dubbed the best development in the region since electricity. That is quite a statement. The reason that this coalition government has provided that infrastructure is that it has made peoples' lives so much better—in feeding stock and providing water for domestic uses.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it doesn't stop there. The member for Mallee and the previous member for Mallee managed to get well in excess of $100 million for projects such as the Sunraysia Modernisation Project. On the Sunraysia Modernisation Project, the member for Mallee recently was responsible for a $7.8 million upgrade—with 60 jobs in the construction. Before that, the coalition was involved with a $120 million investment in that Sunraysia project. But the member for Mallee's work doesn't stop there. There was $29 million for the Mitiamo and District Reticulated Water Supply Project, which provides a secure pressurised water supply to sustain a viable regional economy with improved service delivery and reliability.

         The coalition continues with its work in water infrastructure. Scottsdale irrigation in Tasmania was completed in May 2020. I know that the members for Braddon and Bass have strongly support that and what it has done to drive and secure the economy of central Tasmania. In Queensland, the members for Capricornia and Flynn—it is in the electorate of Flynn—have provided strong support for Rookwood Weir, which will provide millions and millions of dollars annually in returns and also a vast increase in employment in that area. It only happened because of the continual support for that project from people such as the members for Capricornia and Flynn, the coalition government and also the senator in

         , Senator Canavan.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my electorate, work is continuing on Dungowan dam. That's an important piece of infrastructure. As an anecdote, usually they sell, at best, about 10 industrial blocks—maybe six to 10—but, after they announced that dam, they sold in excess of 60. One organisation, Baiada, which is owned by the Camilleri family, are moving a $600 million investment there that will employ over 1,100 people. That is a clear example, and there are many, many more, of how the coalition government, in the construction of its infrastructure, brings jobs to regional areas and makes our whole nation a stronger place.
