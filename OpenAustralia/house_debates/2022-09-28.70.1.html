       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the still advertised promise on the Labor Party's website which says: 'We will cut power bills for families and businesses by $275 a year compared to today.' Will power bills for families and businesses drop by $275 a year and, if not, why won't the Prime Minister finally apologise for breaking this promise—a promise he repeated 97 times before the last election but not once since?

         ALBANESE (—) (): I thank the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party for her question. It goes to the issue of the cost of power in this country. What we know is that the cheapest form of new energy is renewables. We know that and business knows that, and that's why our plan for cheaper, cleaner energy is supported by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         , but opposed by those opposite; supported by the

         , but opposed by those opposite; supported by the Clean Energy Council, but opposed by those opposite; and supported by businesses, including investor groups. They all understand that Australia has the potential to be a renewable energy superpower.

         Individuals in their electorates, as well as in those represented on this side of the House, know that it makes economic sense to put solar panels on their roofs—not just to protect the environment but because it lowers people's power bills. You make the capital investment and then your power bills go down, therefore it is economically rational to do that. And it is that principle, extrapolated across the economy, that will do it.

         Today, indeed, we had a very significant announcement by the

           The point of order is relevance, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister hasn't said 275 once, and the question was very tight—

            Resume your seat. The Prime Minister does not need to say any words. He is answering the question; he is being relevant regarding the question, which was about the Prime Minister's commitment and promises to cut power bills. I call the Prime Minister.

             And the way that you do that is to manage the change that is occurring in our economy. Those opposite pretended that they were going to have new coal-fired power stations. They pretended that

             was going to be kept open. They used to talk about it at this dispatch box and then it just disappeared as part of the 22 energy policies they announced but didn't deliver.

             Of course, not everyone in the coalition is like that, because the coalition government in
