        Bothwell is a small town in Tasmania's central highlands in regional Tasmania. Like in many similar country towns the ambulance service is operated by local volunteers. The ambulance unit is a vital local service that takes care of not only those people living in the town but the country residents in the surrounding region as well as visitors.

        Currently the Bothwell crew has five members. They are Christine Rogers, Heather Allcock, Tanya Lovell,

        and Wayne Doran. Christine has always lived at Bothwell. She is married to Allan and they have two sons. Christine worked at the town supermarket for 44 years, was a volunteer at the local golf club and is an ambulance officer. She is well known to the local community.

        Heather and her husband, Keith, retired to Bothwell about three years ago. Heather was a nurse and a midwife for more than 45 years. Her skills have been highly valued since she became a volunteer ambulance officer. Tanya and Wayne are the only two of the current crew from the original Bothwell ambulance brigade when it was established in 1993. Tony is a retired farmer and shearer who joined the ambulance unit 10 years ago. He has served the Bothwell community in a variety of capacities over the years. All of these people have been volunteers in many areas of their local community. It is appropriate to recognise their selfless commitment and dedication. I wish them all well in their recruitment process and thank them for the service they provide to the community of the
