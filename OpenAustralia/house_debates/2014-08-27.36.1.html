        , who passed away peacefully aged 95 last Sunday. Arthur was a man of true Labor values and principles. Born and educated in Carrington, Arthur joined the

As state member, Arthur saw the introduction of electrified trains into the city of Newcastle and was a strong advocate for the rights of working men and women, ensuring that those most in need were never left behind. Arthur was a founding member of the Hunter Valley Cancer Appeal, a founder of the Australia Day Council and chair of the

        I offer my condolences to Arthur's wife, Heather, his children, Bill, Joanie and Barry, and his extended family. Arthur's contribution to Newcastle and the Australian Labor Party was immense.
