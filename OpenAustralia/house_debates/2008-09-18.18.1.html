         <p>
          Let me make a series of points in relation to the
          <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R3030" rel="nofollow">
           Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008
          </a>
          and amendments (1) to (93) as moved by the Minister for Resources and Energy. Firstly, the opposition endorse and strongly support the intention of the bill and the supporting cognate bills. It flows in fact from material which we commenced whilst we were in government. Secondly, we do appreciate, as the minister outlined, the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources and their inquiry into the exposure draft of the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008. It was an excellent example of House committees working to improve a bill, working on a bipartisan and constructive basis across this chamber on an issue of genuine resource security and national environmental importance. Thirdly, we also appreciate the minister’s willingness to provide the exposure draft and to engage in genuine discussion with our representative in the Senate.
         </p>
         <p>
          That brings me to the fourth point. We have foreshadowed that we will be moving amendments in the Senate. They will be subject to debate, and I am hopeful that we will receive the support and agreement of the government on those amendments. The fifth point is a respectful point of disagreement in relation to these 93 amendments, not in relation to the content; we will scrutinise that carefully. I have been advised, and therefore my understanding is, there was an agreement that such amendments would be held back until after the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, which is also conducting an inquiry, had reported. I remain to be corrected on that, but it would certainly have been our preference in any event that the Senate committee, which is conducting a parallel inquiry and is due to report to the Senate on 16 October 2008, would have been allowed to present its findings before these amendments were moved.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nevertheless, the opposition will not be opposing these amendments at this point. We will consider them carefully as part of the process. We have a respectful view—to the minister and to the government—that perhaps these amendments were called forward to deal with a gap in the government’s legislative agenda, which is not so much to say it is the minister’s fault as to make a broader criticism about the government’s absence of legislative material more generally.
         </p>
         <p>
          With all of those elements, we acknowledge the intention of the bill. We appreciate the work of the House of Representatives committee. We acknowledge the minister’s general consultation on this. We foreshadow our right—and our intention, in fact—to present amendments in the Senate. Whilst not opposing the bill, we note our concern about the failure to wait until after the Senate committee had reported. I believe it would have been sensible, prudent and reasonable to have waited until after 16 October 2008 and after the Senate committee’s material and advice was on the table. Nevertheless, for those reasons we support the intention of the bill and we choose not to oppose these amendments at this point as they pass through the House.

           firstly indicate my appreciation of the constructive comments of the opposition spokesperson. With respect to the debate, the bills were brought on because of their importance. The Australian government regard the intent of this legislation as fundamentally important to our economic and environmental future. They are therefore, in our minds, matters that require urgent and proper consideration by both houses. Hence, we wanted to facilitate this debate sooner rather than later because our desire is to endeavour to get them through both houses to enable us, sooner rather than later, to release acreage for proper consideration from a greenhouse gas point of view in a commercial sense.
          </p>
          <p>
           Secondly, can I say that I have no knowledge of any undertaking that the House of Representatives should delay its work to await the work of the other place. In this instance, the House of Representatives has finally started to seize the opportunities to consider legislation in its own right. Historically, this House has all too often not utilised its own committee structure to its advantage and has deferred to the other house. The House has been given an oppor-tunity on this occasion to consider a bill in detail and to express a point of view that the government has responded to, and we all appreciate the huge amount of work that went into the preparation of that report. I indicated that we would respond to the House report to enable members to consider our response in the debate in the House of Representatives, because the report represents the consideration of the bill by fellow members of the House and therefore members of the House are entitled to know the government’s view on the recommendations of the House committee.
          </p>
          <p>
           With respect to the opposition, there have been and will continue to be consultations about any outstanding issues. Our desire is to reach agreement with the opposition because we appreciate that in the context of this bill they are absolutely supportive of the endeavours of the government to put in place greenhouse gas storage opportunities in offshore areas of Australia, the responsibility of the Australian government. I know that was the desire of the previous minister, the member for Groom, who sat down on a number of occasions in detailed discussions with me and my staff, and we will continue those discussions, the last meeting having been as late as this morning.
          </p>
          <p>
           I commend the amendments to the House and simply express my appreciation to all members on both sides for their assistance in considering what is a very complex and difficult bill but one of major significance to our future in the 21st century.

            endorse the words of the minister and thank him for the assistance that he, his office and his department have offered to the opposition on what is, as he said, an extraordinarily complex issue, an issue which will underpin by far the biggest proportion of the low-emissions strategy for the Commonwealth government of Australia as we go forward from here.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the minister said and as I am sure my colleague said, this is an extraordinarily complicated process. It is a process that spans back to the time when I was the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. It is a process that, if we are not careful, will span into the time of the next minister for resources. The member for Batman and I do not know when that will be—

                Okay, back to the issue. This issue has the potential not to be resolved, not because of any loss of goodwill from our side of parliament or loss of determination or goodwill from the government. It needs to be managed precisely as we go forward. There are complexities in the legislation which, as the minister said, as late as this morning were still not resolved, and there are going to be issues between the shadow minister for resources, Senator Johnston, me as his representative in this House and the minister opposite and, I assume, the Senate economics committee as well. I understand their report may be released today but will not be formally reported to the Senate until 16 October.
               </p>
               <p>
                All those processes need to take their full time. We cannot afford to rush this because, if we get it wrong, whilst we may have legislation in place we will have actually gone backwards. We are trying to do in Australia what no-one else has done. We are trying to lay down a framework also, on behalf of the Commonwealth, which will be adopted, we hope, by a majority of the states. Some states will choose a separate process, but if they are smart, quite frankly, they will choose this process. We need to get it right. We need to ensure the holders both of petroleum exploration leases and, perhaps, of leases that have gone past that into retention leases and production leases are satisfied with the process. They may not welcome this occurrence but they understand the reason it is happening. At the same time we need to ensure that legal entitlements are maintained.
               </p>
               <p>
                This issue is of crucial importance, so I seek an undertaking from the government that they will ensure that all processes are given full run and that the debate and discussions that go on in the Senate are not forced through in such a way that the Senate Standing Committee on Economics is not able to present its report before the legislation is finalised. I commit the opposition to ongoing support of and dialogue with the government on this matter. I hope that we can bring about a satisfactory resolution for all parties involved.

                 I appreciate the comments of the member for Groom. Like the opposition, we await the Senate report to see if there are any other thoughtful proposals that can improve this bill. I give the member for Groom and the opposition an undertaking that in the lead-up to that Senate report and after it is received we will continue discussions. Our proposal to have this considered in the Senate as soon as possible will not stand in the way of seeking to conclude those discussions and of reaching an accommodation with the opposition. My office has commenced discussions with two Independent senators because of the importance of also consulting those senators who have taken an interest in these matters and are generally supportive of them, as is the opposition.
