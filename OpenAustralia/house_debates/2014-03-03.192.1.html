       <p>
        As I move around my electorate I come across inspiring stories which restore one's faith in humanity. Recently I visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS" rel="nofollow">
         JBS
        </a>
        meat processing plant, a large-scale employer on the outskirts of Rockhampton. Tracey Rich works there as the stores purchasing manager. Her eldest son, Jason, was 21 when he was killed in his car while driving to work. Jason wasn't speeding but, due to lack of experience, he was unable to control his car in very poor weather conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tracey, and Jason's best mate Jacob McLuskie, have made it their mission to honour him through the Jason Rich Foundation. Their goal is to raise funds to pay for places for year 12 students in Rockhampton to undertake defensive driving courses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Undertaking such a course costs $154 per student. During my meeting at JBS, I was made aware that the company is contributing over $9,000 to fund 60 such places to put P-plate students through the course. Companies like this and their staff contribute much to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        A further goal of the Jason Rich Foundation is to encourage the government to make it mandatory for all students to undertake a defensive driving course before they leave school. The foundation will hold more fundraising events over the next few months. If local people, or indeed my parliamentary colleagues, wish to donate to such a worthwhile cause, please get in touch with me.
