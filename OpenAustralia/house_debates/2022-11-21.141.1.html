        I very much look forward to, at 9.30 this Friday morning in Fitzhardinge Street, taking part in the official opening of the new state-of-the-art, world-class
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">

        community centre. PCYC, as we all know, is a fun community club. It's home to the PCYC Emergency Service Cadets program, and in 2022—just this Friday—they're going to be moving into a new facility in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        where they're going to able to offer even more options for the youth of the district. PCYC Wagga Wagga was the inspiration for the song, 'Morning of my Life', by none other than the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Gees" rel="nofollow">
         Bee Gees
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Gibb" rel="nofollow">

        has talked about his time staying at the PCYC in Wagga Wagga and how the Bee Gees wrote that hit song from the club—the old premises in Gurwood Street.

        Funding for this new $23 million project comprises $10 million from the former coalition federal government, $10 million from the

         Wagga Wagga City Council
        </a>
        . I fought tirelessly to secure funding for this important investment, and it is not just an investment in a great new piece of infrastructure but an investment in—what could be more important?—our youth. Of course, it's overlooking
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson_Oval" rel="nofollow">
         Robertson Oval
        </a>
        , and, whilst I appreciate the new building has a great vista overlooking Robertson Oval, I hope that in the future they can take more advantage of that with, perhaps, even more infrastructure put in place. Already the new site is going to include a large multipurpose hall—large enough to house four indoor sports courts, and I know Wagga Wagga Basketball Association is going to be one of the first tenants—as well as activity rooms, a cafe, a youth club, a childcare centre, after-school care and 120 undercover car parking spaces. It's some 5,800 square metres in size. It's built on the site of the former South Wagga Sports and Bowling Club, and I know the late
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brown" rel="nofollow">

        would be very pleased to see that the club he was president of for so many years is now being put to use as the site for the new facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know what a difference this is going to make for thousands of young people, some of whom have not had a great start in life, who are going to be given great options and opportunities for the future, thanks to this new facility. I know this is going to be a wonderful boost to our central business district. Already, it has created many, many jobs and many, many opportunities. The future is fantastic. I know one person who is going to be very excited on Friday is Fred Loneragan, club supervisor for many years. He was at the club for 22 of his 44 years in policing, until 2000. Well done to all concerned.
