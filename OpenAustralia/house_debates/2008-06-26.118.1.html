       <p>
        On many occasions over the past 10 years I have raised on behalf of the people that I represent in this place the issue of the conflict in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lanka
        </a>
        . Today I again voice my concerns in the parliament about the ongoing war in Sri Lanka, particularly the killing of innocent victims, including the most innocent of all—the children. It is incumbent on all sides of politics to seek a peaceful resolution to the dispute that has engulfed the island of Sri Lanka and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. This intractable conflict has been going on for some three decades, and the time has arrived for all governments of the world to unite and to call on all parties to cease the bloodshed and work towards a peaceful solution and the resettlement and rehabilitation of Tamils in the war-torn region of north-east Sri Lanka.
       </p>
       <p>
        I again call for the proper implementation of the 2002 ceasefire agreement, which was negotiated in good faith by all parties to the conflict. This ceasefire brought optimism for all
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankans" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lankans
        </a>
        —and, indeed, citizens around the world—that there would be an end to the needless death and displacement of innocent people. All reasonable people, be they Tamil, Singhalese or Muslim, are demanding a peaceful solution from their government and the support of all governments around the world. Following the deaths of over 60,000 people, this is not much to expect.
       </p>
       <p>
        All people of Sri Lanka deserve peace. They all recognise that no political, cultural or religious cause, conflict or dispute can be worth so many wasted lives. I have a document which I seek leave to table. It is in the form of a petition but it is not within the form outlined in
        <i>
         House of Representatives Practice
        </i>
        . Needless to say, it represents the voices of some 4,169 Australians, who on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka request that our government appeal to the government of Sri Lanka to do everything in its power to get a peaceful resolution to this dreadful conflict. I seek leave to table that document.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you.
