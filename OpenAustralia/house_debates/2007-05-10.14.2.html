        Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report:

        co-location with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Government
        </a>
        on the eco-sciences and health and food sciences precincts in Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed knowledge based research business initiative will be a collaborative venture between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
        </a>
        , the CSIRO, and a number of Queensland government agencies at two key locations in south-east Queensland. These are the eco-sciences precinct at the Boggo Road Urban Village in Dutton Park and the health and food sciences precinct at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopers_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Coopers Plains
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The eco-sciences precinct will be a centre of excellence focusing on climate change adaptation, better managing Australia’s natural resources and environment, and growing Australia’s farming, mineral, forestry, marine and tourism industries so that they are competitive and sustainable.
       </p>
       <p>
        The two new precincts will provide accommodation for 1,200 science professionals and support staff. This consists of 1,010 at the eco-sciences precinct and 190 at the health and food sciences precinct, and includes long-term visitors and postgraduate students. The eco-sciences precinct will consist of offices and support staff areas, an education centre, a workshop, laboratories, an insect house, glasshouses, greenhouses and a cafe. Similarly the health and food sciences precinct will consist of offices and support staff areas, laboratories and a pilot plant for the development of new food products.
       </p>
       <p>
        Co-location of the numerous partner groups at the eco-sciences precinct will create one of the largest concentrations of scientists in these fields in Australia. The two precincts will enable greatly increased sharing of high-level skills and of expensive equipment and facilities. This will increase the rate of progress and reduce the costs of research. The respective buildings have been designed to maximise opportunities for interaction between the partners, to provide flexibility in the use of space in the shorter term, and to meet the changing needs of research in the longer term. The partners have agreed to equitably contribute to the cost of shared facilities and to independently meet the cost of any special facilities required.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated completion cost for the two developments is $375 million, of which the CSIRO component is estimated at $85 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is anticipated that early packages will be let to allow site establishment works to commence in February next year for the Boggo Road site and at the same time for the main works on the Coopers Plains site. I commend the motion to the House.

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Rationalisation of ADF facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMAF" rel="nofollow">

        Butterworth, Malaysia.

       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes to undertake a rationalisation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        facilities at the

        —RMAF—Base Butterworth, in Malaysia.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMAF_Butterworth" rel="nofollow">
         RMAF Butterworth

        supports deployments of aircraft from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        ’s air combat, airlift and aerospace operational support groups, defence exercises and visiting units, and contributes to the defence of Australia’s regional interests. Defence has an ongoing requirement in maintaining a presence at RMAF Butterworth, and consequently a long-term requirement for the facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project reinforces Australia’s commitment to the five-power defence arrangements and will enable the Australian Defence Force to provide buildings which meet modern occupational health and safety requirements with improved efficiencies. The work will also enhance defence capability by enabling personnel mobility, morale, esprit de corps and training outcomes, as well as personnel retention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project proposes the construction of three new headquarters buildings, a combined armoury, installation of a sewerage effluent treatment plant and the refurbishment of some existing facilities. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposal is $23.6 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval and further design, construction will start in early 2008 for completion in late 2009. On completion of the project, a small number of redundant buildings may be returned to the Malaysian Ministry of Defence. I commend the motion to the House.
