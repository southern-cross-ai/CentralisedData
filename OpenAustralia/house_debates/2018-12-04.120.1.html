        . These are texts that described and, more importantly, defined our new nation. They gave us a voice, an identity, and created a connection with our unique environment, and would serve as a strong foundation for the enduring and lasting love that so many of us have for this great land of ours. At the time, they represented a break from the past, when children would rely solely on British or European tales set in an environment far from their own experience.

        It's hard to tell, hard to say. I don't know if the bush babies found me or I found the little creatures.

        Following the publication of

        . It wasn't just May Gibbs's mastery of prose that brought her genuine acclaim. It was also her unique genius as an illustrator and artist. Her artwork was inspired and brought her characters to life. So ingrained and embedded in our culture are they that many of them are instantly recognisable to millions of Australians. So many of us fell in love with Snugglepot and Cuddlepie in their quest to see a human, marvelled at the adventures of Nuttybub, and trembled in fear for the sad, shy little blossom Narnywos, held captive by the Bad Banksia Men.
