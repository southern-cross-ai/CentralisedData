        My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to Graham Manning, a dairy farmer in Harvey,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . One of the biggest costs in his small business is electricity, because he refrigerates thousands of litres of milk every day. Does the Treasurer expect him to absorb the cost of the carbon tax, or will this cost simply be passed on to the consumer through higher prices for milk?

         I thank the member for her question. We have made it very clear that all of the detail for pricing carbon will be provided on Sunday. We have made it very clear that we will be putting a price on carbon pollution on up to 100—sorry, up to 1,000—

             Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I simply say, on behalf of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that when you were speaking earlier on the point of order that I made, the minister for health interjected and you told her to be quiet but did not remove her from the chamber under 94(a). Yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been removed under 94 (a). I simply ask if you think that is fair.

               We have already made it very clear that the consequence of putting a price on carbon pollution for up to 1,000 of our largest polluters will have modest price increases. We have made that very clear. And of course they will flow through the system, which is why the government is so intent on putting in place additional assis­tance for households, and we have outlined the principles that that will be based on. There will also be—

                  I was making it very clear that there will be additional assistance for households: there will be tax cuts, there will be increases in family payments and there will be increases in pensions. All of those things are very important. I know they do not matter to those opposite, because if they were in power they would simply rip them out.

All of the detail will be there on Sunday for everybody to see, and can I just make this point: we absolutely look forward to this debate in the weeks ahead so that all of the scaremongering that has come from those opposite can be exposed for what it is.

                       <p class="italic">
                        As major Australian and international corporations and representative associations operating across the Australian economy we strongly support the introduction of a well designed carbon price to support the transition to a low-carbon economy.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Those companies, which are major corporations operating within our economy, know, along with every credible economist, that putting a price on carbon pollution is the cheapest and most cost-effective way of cutting pollution. Of course, it is not a tax on households; it is a charge that will be paid by fewer than 1,000 of the largest polluters in the economy for every tonne of pollution that they produce.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The carbon price will be good for the economy and it will be good for the environment, whilst households will be assisted to meet the modest cost impacts of the introduction of a carbon price. Nine out of 10 households will get some combination of tax cuts and increased payments. Pensioners will benefit from an increase in the pension. Many self-funded retirees will receive assistance equal to the extra payments that we will provide to other pensioners, part pensioners and carers. At least three million households will also get a 20 per cent buffer over and above the average price impacts of the carbon price to give them that bit of extra cash. Families, tradespeople and of course small businesses with light commercial vehicles will not face a fuel price rise as a result of the introduction of a carbon price. These are very important commitments to accompany the introduction of the carbon price in our economy.

                        Households should also be very clear that the Leader of the Opposition intends taking all of these rises in the pension, intends clawing back the tax cuts, intends taking back all of the assistance—

                            of Opposition Business has made a relevant point of order. I cringe when I hear a question that finishes with: 'How has it been received and what is the government's response?' but I do have an expectation that ministers will try to relate their material directly to that aspect of the question without just going into debate willy-nilly. The minister has the call and he should recognise that point.

                             Of course, I was asked how the government's announcement of a carbon price has been received and what the government's response to that is. It is relevant, I would submit, that the opposition has a position that it would take away the benefits that the government intends provid­ing as part of this package to pensioners, self-funded retirees and families.

                               You might consider that he is defying, but I am simply absolutely trying to indicate the difficulties that the chair has under the present standing orders that allow questions that have this type of addition at the end. I will listen carefully, very carefully, to the way in which the minister relates his material directly, because that is the new standing order. Under the previous standing order, ministers from both sides of politics perfected ways of making a smidgen of relevance, but this has to be directly relevant. Therefore the preamble of the question is very important. The minister.

                                      Going to the point of order on the whole, the member has mentioned a person's name. It is usual that one would take on face value that the member is quoting what he has been informed by the person he has named. This is a question that I have heard in its manifestation over a number of proposals put before this parliament by both sides and I indicate that I will allow the question. I am sure the Treasurer will now respond in a directly relevant manner.
