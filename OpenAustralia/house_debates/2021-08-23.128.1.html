        and meet with some incredible young women who had participated in the World's Greatest Shave. This is a really important initiative. It raises funds for those suffering from blood cancer and encourages Australians to shave their heads in solidarity with the 50 people who are diagnosed with this cancer every single day. Funds raised help those with blood cancer to navigate the uncertain time following diagnosis by helping to provide accommodation near life-saving treatment at no cost, and specially trained blood cancer support workers. Donations like these provide hope for countless people and further the work of scientists who are researching important future treatments.

        St Joseph's at East Gosford had a goal of reaching $20,000 in donations, but they were overwhelmed with support and raised a total $34,320, an incredible effort. Local hairdressers from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        volunteered their time to help, and the whole school community gathered. Some of the students that I spoke with told me how their classmates and teachers had actually stayed back after the school bell to stand in solidarity as the girls who were participating courageously shaved, coloured or cut their hair. I really commend those involved, including Sophie Holliday, who was team captain and who helped to organise the day; Emma Gulliksen; Phoebe Sheridan;

        Some of the students shared with me what motivated them to get involved. One young woman said she participated because 'At St Joseph's we lost a teacher who was very special to all of us. Her name was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_P" rel="nofollow">
         Mrs P
        </a>
        ourbozorgi, and, although I didn't know her well, I'd heard amazing things about her.' She said, 'I was also cutting my hair for all of those who face cancer. I'm not sick. My hair will grow back. And being kind is the easiest thing in the world.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Another student said, 'Cancer has touched a lot of people in my family, people my parents know, and, more recently, it touched someone who was really special to me. I decided to do the World's Greatest Shave to honour one of my favourite teachers, Mrs Pourbozorgi, who passed away earlier this year from cancer. Mrs P was special. She was caring, loving, funny and always pushed me to be my best, and she enjoyed joking around with us. When she passed away I was devastated. I wanted to do something to honour her memory, so when Sophie Holliday started the campaign for World's Greatest Shave I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do. After all, it's just hair, and if I can help find a cure for something so horrible I will help in any way I can.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Another student said to me, 'I immediately jumped on board when I found out about the initiative, which was a huge shock to my family, as I have always hidden behind my long, blonde hair. Thirty-four thousand dollars later I'm so proud of what our team has accomplished. I'm also so proud of our entire school for pulling through. Nerves really hit when the big day came, and it definitely proved to be an emotional event, with the entire school staying to watch each of us participate. Even my fellow year 12 students, during their half day when they were free to go home, they stayed. Everyone offered their support, especially my twin sister. As the last piece of hair was shaved off, I turned to witness her trying to hold in tears, which then had me doing so as well.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Another student said, 'Hope is one of our school's core values, and the World's Greatest Shave was an opportunity to raise donations that contribute to giving hope to those affected by blood cancer.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The efforts of these young women cannot be underestimated, particularly as they are approaching major events in their own lives, including graduations and school formals. They are mature beyond their years, and they demonstrate the profound impact that a teacher can have on the lives of their students. Mrs P was clearly no exception. She made a profound, incredible difference in the life of every single one of the students she taught. She will be missed by the entire school community and by generations of students to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the efforts of the students at St Joseph's,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick's" rel="nofollow">
         St Patrick's
        </a>
        primary school, just down the road, decided they too would get involved, and they held a 'crazy hair day', with a gold coin donation, encouraging students to be as creative as possible with their hair. They raised $500, a great effort, and I really want to congratulate them.
