       <p>
        It's quite upsetting to speak on this condolence motion and talk about Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon, or 'Fitzy', as his mates know him. Jack was a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations" rel="nofollow">
         Special Operations
        </a>
        Command. He was a special forces soldier, and the 2nd
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Commando Regiment
        </a>
        was his home. When I think about Jack, I think about his family, his loved ones, his mates and his service to this nation and I think about the unit that he served in.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2nd Commando Regiment is a combat war-fighting unit within
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Command" rel="nofollow">
         Special Operations Command
        </a>
        . It operates alongside other
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCOMD" rel="nofollow">
         SOCOMD
        </a>
        elements. The role of 2 Commando is to conduct strategic strike, counterterrorism and special recovery operations. They are a war-fighting capability. 2 Commando focuses on advanced force operations, direct action missions. Self-contained, flexible and rapidly deployable, they are structured for both special operations and domestic counterterrorism, and they have quite a few specialties. One of those specialties is parachuting. Special operations do combat jumps. They jump behind enemy lines to disrupt the enemy movement, to take the fight to this nation's enemies. To do this, you must train how you fight. There is significant risk with the training that the 2nd Commando Regiment does, and tragedies, unfortunately, happen. Due to the actions of members of 2 Commando who were on this training parachute jump as well, they were able to get to the ground as quickly as possible, work on Jack and get signs of life back in him, and, in doing so, it led to the family being able to say their goodbyes, which is a great testament to the calibre of the members in the unit.
       </p>
       <p>
        To his mates that are watching back in the regiment, there's nothing I can say that will fill the hole and the pain that you're feeling right now. To Joel, Jack's dad, nothing we can say in this place can even come close to being able to help or fill the hole of pain as well, and, to the family, I'm so sorry for your loss.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jack's dad, Joel, in 2009, as the defence minister, came to Townsville to see me off on my deployment to Afghanistan. He sent me to war. We had conversations when he was the member for Hunter, and I thanked him for the deployment. People were killed on the deployment that I was on and have been killed on subsequent deployments.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">
         Joel Fitzgibbon
        </a>
        , as the minister, spoke to families and attended funerals. He saw the sacrifice of our brave men and women that have deployed, and not once would he have ever thought that he would be receiving the call that he used to make. I'm sorry that he had to take that call. Defence and the members of defence put themselves at risk every day. Now the members of 2 Commando are training for how they would fight on operations, and they train hard so they can fight easy. Parachuting is not just inherently dangerous; it is a vital skill set of the 2nd Commando Regiment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just last weekend, I hosted members of 2 Commando here in Parliament House. I gave them a tour, showed them around, had a chat about life, had a chat about the unit and spoke about Jack, and the pain that's going through every single one of his mates will be there forever. When we went out that night to another event, where there were another 30-odd members of 2 Commando, you could see it in their eyes, their voice and how they spoke to each other that the pain was real and the sadness was real.
       </p>
       <p>
        A friend of mine is a member of 2 Commando, and I had a long chat with him that night and the next day. The pain that he feels is reverberating through 2 Commando, Special Operations Command and the wider ADF community and it will be there forever because they lost a brother. They lost their family member—a person that they call family. I've lost friends of mine, and it stays. It's like losing a part of you, and it stays with you forever. My heart breaks for Joel and the family, his loved ones and his mates. My heart breaks for SOCOMD because they lost a fighter, a member of their family and a member of their tribe. They lost someone who would sacrifice everything in the name of service and who was a professional. I'm sorry that this has happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without our Special Operations Command, our members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
         SAS
        </a>
        and 2 Commando, training this way and training hard, they would lose vital skill sets to keep this nation safe. Second Commando will continue to jump, continue to train hard and continue to take the fight to the enemy when they're called. And the memory of Jack, Fitzy, will be forever with the unit, and his spirit will be on the shoulders of every soldier who finds themselves at 2nd Commando and every soldier who serves in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        We've lost too many people on operations, but we lose people in training as well, and we must honour them. We must honour them not just in condolence motions but in ways that are fitting for their unit, and for the wider Australian public to know that the risk is real. The risk is extremely real.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I'm very sorry for your loss. I'm sorry—to your brothers at 2nd Commando, who have lost a mate. And I know that they would be so proud to have called Jack Fitzgibbon, Fitzy, a brother. 'Without warning' is the motto of 2nd Commando. They are professional, we will see them in the fight again soon, and I'm very sorry for the loss.

        <p>
         I pay tribute to Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon and thank him for his service to our nation. Lance Corporal Fitzgibbon passed away on 7 March after being injured during a training exercise at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         Base Richmond the previous evening. He was surrounded by his family and was just 33 years of age. Despite being so young, Jack had served with the ADF for over 10 years, six years in special forces. He was a qualified military freefaller within the Defence Force
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , and he was an experienced parachutist, having done 106 jumps, 95 of them as military freefall.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jack was promoted from private to lance corporal last year. He had previously deployed to assist in the floods in 2022 and, prior to that, he was deployed to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         . Jack was awarded the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Medal" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Medal
         </a>
         , the Operational Service Badge, the military and operational service medal and the counterterrorism/special recovery medal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jack was, of course, the son of my good mate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">
          Joel Fitzgibbon
         </a>
         , the former member for Hunter. The Fitzgibbon family is synonymous with the Newcastle and Hunter region. Joel's father and Jack's grandfather, Eric, was the member for Hunter in this place for many, many years. Our hearts bleed for the Fitzgibbon family.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jack was born and raised in the Hunter. He went to school locally and he personified the spirit of that region—a larrikin with a cheeky grin who loved his community. Like his grandfather and his dad, he played for the local rugby league team, the Cessnock Goannas, and they had a heartfelt tribute to Jack at a recent event. But, most importantly, Jack was a son, a brother and a brother-in-law and will be sadly missed by his family.
        </p>
        <p>
         There's no higher honour than serving the people of our nation, and Jack did that with dedication and distinction. To ensure that our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         is as best prepared as possible for a mission, they train in the most realistic conditions as possible. The special forces are the elite of the elite. They are the ones who we send into the most dangerous situations. On many occasions those special forces may be required to insert themselves in hostile territory, beyond enemy lines, in all types of conditions, and that includes parachuting at night.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jack was certainly experienced in this. As I said earlier, he'd done 106 jumps. He was well trained and very experienced. But, of course, with any style of exercise such as that, there comes risk. Jack accepted that risk and chose to serve. That takes selflessness, courage and honour, and Jack is that courage and honour that is so proudly represented by the men and women of Australia who wear the Australian Defence Force uniform. We in this place and the people of Australia honour Jack. We thank him for his courage and for his selfless service to our country.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the Fitzgibbon family, to Joel, Dianne, Caitlin, Grace and Maxine, I offer my sincerest condolences on behalf of the people of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Kingsford Smith
         </a>
         . We offer you our love and support. Life is not meant to be like this; you're not meant to bury your kids. The Fitzgibbon family are going through something that no family should have to experience, but they should do so knowing that everyone in this place and the people of Australia—and, most importantly, Jack's comrades, his brothers and sisters in arms—offer their love and complete support for the family. We also thank you, the Fitzgibbon family, for your courage and for your sacrifice through the service of your son to the Australian Defence Force. Vale, Jack Fitzgibbon. Thank you for your service to our nation.

         </small>
         <p>
          I rise to speak on the tragic death of Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon. Primarily I want to offer my deepest sympathy to his family—Joel, Dianne, Caitlin, Grace and Maxine—and his closest friends. Like so many others, I've worked with Joel in this parliament over the years. I'm not surprised that his son, from what we've heard, inherited so many of his characteristics from his dad, and I have no doubt that those same characteristics helped to make him the man that he became. As has been said here, with Joel as defence minister in 2009, I can only imagine how proud Joel and the whole family would have been when Jack enlisted. However, from a family perspective, none of us ever want to bury a child. It is every parent's worst nightmare, and when it happens it literally breaks your heart. It's a nightmare that the Fitzgibbon family now live with, every day and every night. The pride they have for their son and his military career will always be with them. Their love for him, as a son, a brother and a partner, will last forever, but so will their grief and loss.
         </p>
         <p>
          I acknowledge the enormous courage and personal strength of the Fitzgibbon family, who had the courage to be with us in the chamber last week. I can only imagine the emotional toll, on the back of what the family is already going through day and night, of being here in the chamber to listen to the incredibly respectful and caring speeches that were made for Jack and his family. I also want to acknowledge Jack's fellow Defence Force members, who also sat in the chamber on Thursday, and acknowledge those in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations" rel="nofollow">
           Special Operations
          </a>
          Command, who were his mates, and what they have gone through and will continue to go through. We know that they face daily the same risks as Jack in their training and constant preparedness to respond whenever they are called on. Thank you for what you're doing for this nation every day, and thank you to Jack for his service.
         </p>
         <p>
          These are the people who are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to keep Australians safe. I'm the daughter of a World War

           II
          </a>
          widow, so I understand exactly what the sacrifice Jack has made means for his family. We've lived with it. My own sisters never really knew their dad. They were just babies when he was killed in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
           Papua New Guinea
          </a>
          in 1943. What I do know is that Jack Fitzgibbon's sacrifice is a sacrifice that is, and will continue to be, borne by his whole family and his friends and mates.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have spoken previously on behalf of the families of our fallen Defence Force members, both in my community and in this place. Given our family's experience, the following verse is actually for Jack's family:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          You thought of him with love today,
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          but that is nothing new.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          You thought about him yesterday,
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          and days before that too.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          You think of him in silence,
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          you often speak his name.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Now all you have are memories
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          and his picture in a frame.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          His memory is your keepsake
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          with which you'll never part.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          God has Jack in his keeping,
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          but you have him in your heart.
         </p>
         <p>
          My heart goes out to his family and his mates.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to finish my contribution today with a verse for the ages by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bean" rel="nofollow">

          historian. This is as true today as it was at the end of World War I:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          What these men did nothing can alter now. The good and the bad, the greatness and smallness of their story will stand. Whatever of glory it contains nothing now can lessen. It rises, as it will always rise, above the mists of ages, a monument to great-hearted men; and, for their nation, a possession for ever.
         </p>
         <p>
          Rest in peace Jack Fitzgibbon. Lest we forget.

           It's an honour to be able to speak today in this place to honour the life of one taken too early in the service of our nation, Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon. I'm deeply saddened by the tragic death of Jack Fitzgibbon, and I speak here today in two capacities: one as the Minister for Defence Personnel and the other as a friend of Jack's dad, our former colleague

           , a career he aspired to since being a child. Jack not only loved what he did but, by all accounts, he excelled. He was highly specialised and qualified. He was a leader. He was gold standard, it was said, by his colleagues. Throughout his service he was awarded the

           Jack did one of the hardest things there is to do in our Defence Force, and he died doing what he loved in our nation's uniform. The death of anyone in service is of the greatest regret; it's why, when it occurs, we speak about it in this parliament. These are individuals who have worn our uniform and done what we've asked of them, and they have made the ultimate sacrifice for doing it. It's a confronting reminder—but a necessary reminder—to us all of the risks that our Defence Force personnel take every single day in our nation's name.
          </p>
          <p>
           In my role as minister, I receive notifications of all sorts of things that afflict, injure or harm our serving members. But receiving the notification in relation to the injuries caused from the accident that Jack was involved in came with the added shock of knowing who this person was and knowing who his next of kin were as well. That's why I also speak here today as a friend of Joel Fitzgibbon. When I received that notification I reached out to Joel directly. It's not something anyone wants to do, but they have to do it in this role. But it's also the case that, even when you don't know the person involved, those of us in these roles—like me, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and anyone involved in this area—will always think about the ramifications and reverberations, not just those in the instant but those that will continue to reverberate through time for that person's family, friends and colleagues.
          </p>
          <p>
           In this instance, I've not know Joel as long as some other members of this chamber have, but I've been very proud to have served two terms of the parliament with him. He was someone whose advice I deeply valued. In the time that I spent with Joel, though, he was someone, like so many people in this parliament, who was deeply proud of the achievements and exploits of all his children. And he certainly spoke about Jack. He spoke about Jack in terms of being deeply proud of his service. He was deeply proud of what Jack had achieved in the Defence Force and what he did. He was also a proud dad of the fact that Jack had a bit of Joel's larrikin spirit as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           Certainly it was a great honour to be able to join Jack's family, friends and colleagues at Jack's funeral in Cessnock. There are a few things I want to highlight from that service. It was a great military funeral. It had all of the appropriate trappings that should go with honouring somebody who died in service. It was a great honouring and celebration of Jack's life—the things he did not only as a member of our Defence Force but also over his entire life. There was no stepping away from his larrikin spirit and the things that he did that caused people to laugh with him and laugh at him, and that is a great thing.
          </p>
          <p>
           But what was also really important was that, while it was reported on the day that there were many dignitaries that attended that funeral—and that was a great thing for somebody in our Defence Force, but it was a great thing for the Fitzgibbon family—front and centre were Jack, Jack's family and Jack's colleagues. It wasn't about the people with titles who were there. It was all about honouring his service, celebrating his life and having an opportunity to stand with our friend and our colleague, to mourn with them and to support them. No parent should ever have to bury their child, and here in this place I want to extend my deepest condolences, thoughts and prayers to my friend and Jack's dad, Joel; to his mum, Dianne; to his sisters, Caitlin and Grace; to his partner, Kass; and to his colleagues and the broader defence family, who all feel his death as loss.
          </p>
          <p>
           Rest in peace, Jack Fitzgibbon, and thank you for your service.

           <p>
            I rise today to, like everybody else, pay my respects to Jack Patrick Fitzgibbon, who, in serving his nation, was tragically injured and later died from his wounds. I know Joel very well and I know Dianne. They're in the seat next door to mine, and, as people know, Joel and I were on television together for years as sparring partners. As people probably understand, this is our football paddock. We play football hard on the paddock, but we don't play it in the corridors and we don't play it in the changerooms.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joel is a good fella, and the Fitzgibbons are a good a family. Joel's father served in parliament, Joel served in parliament and his son served in the Army. That's a family of honour. I've said that numerous times, and Joel's probably sick of hearing me say it. But that's a family of honour, and that honour remains with the family forevermore. Jack's service and the honour that that has brought to the Fitzgibbon family remains with that family and will remain with them forevermore. But, for Joel, Dianne, Caitlin, Grace and his partner, Kass, the sorrow will remain with them forevermore as well. Nothing is going to replace that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every time this time of year comes around, there'll be thoughts about their beautiful boy, and you can just see from the photos that he was a fit, happy young man. As a lance corporal, they say he didn't chase being an officer. But he'd been school captain, so he obviously had leadership capabilities. I must admit that I'm proposing here that he enjoyed his time with his troops and enjoyed being with his men. He loved his life—that's what Joel said. We all, at some stage, come to our demise—we're all going to come to our end. It's not everything, but the form in which it comes to an end is a big part of it. Jack lived a very full life, for the very short time he had it, and died doing what he loved. But, in doing what he loved, he was also serving our nation. If we don't have people who sign on the dotted line—and, as soon as you do that, put your life on the line—then we can't defend our nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's so sad when you see someone with a smile on their face, a larrikin air, a beer in their hand at times, who has a bit of fun with people—in that same personality is the sense that 'I'm prepared to give my life in service to my country; I'm prepared and accept that it's absolutely in the realm that I may be killed in training or killed in service'. As soon as Jack put on the uniform, as soon as Jack signed the piece of paper, he would have known that.
           </p>
           <p>
            In recognising Jack, we've got to recognise the many people who have been killed in training—the Blackhawk disaster; we had the Taipan; we've had people throughout the history of the military who have been killed in training. Tragically, they're just as dead as anybody else, and that service should be recognised. I've spoken to other service personnel about how we actually recognise these people, who in service to our nation in the military, have paid the supreme sacrifice by the loss of their life.
           </p>
           <p>
            When we see a person who is so fit and they can do so many things, that's the type of person we want to go into the military. If Jack had a physical impairment, he wouldn't have got in. But, when you're in excellent physical condition and strong in mind like Jack, that's the person who puts their life on the line. I've spoken to Joel a couple of times. Vicky sent out her love to Joel. My heart broke at the funeral, just catching up with Dianne—how her only boy, her beautiful boy, has been taken from her. Her life has been turned upside down. And also to Caitlin and Grace—I only just met Kass—and to the Fitzgibbon family, I say: you're a family of honour.
           </p>
           <p>
            As shadow veterans' affairs minister, I also extend that to all families who have lost their son or daughter through service or through their contribution and participation in Australia's defence forces. Now, with the royal commission on foot, we're seeing the tragedy of so many others in other parts that have lost their life.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope that this memory of Jack, as sad as it is, also recognises the celebration of an incredible life and the celebration of an incredible person. For my own part, when Jack was visiting he had rosary beads, so he was also a person who had faith. As a person of faith, I believe he's with our Lord and maker and his existence now is better than what he would have ever had on earth. If you believe that, you've got to have hope. You can't be totally morose and not accept that there is an afterlife—that this is it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will close on this. I want to commend the military, for the precision and sharpness of that funeral was exceptional. It means something, and I know the member for Solomon has done much more military service than I have. I was in the reserve family for the military. You really do watch—drill. Those men and women were absolutely A1. And that's a sign of respect for the person—how you carry yourself, your dress, your drill, your cadence, your patience and your stillness. It's a sign of discipline and respect.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was thinking about this when the catafalque party came in and rested arms around the coffin of Jack. I was thinking, 'I don't think anybody understands how hard it is to stay motionless for that long.' Why do people do it? Because they are seeing off their mate. What are you going to do for your mate when it's probably innate in your feelings that you don't want to be overt with your emotions and lose your temperance? You say: 'I will do this job, and my job now is drill. My job now is the ceremonial, and I will do absolutely A1 perfectly to show my mate that he had a life well lived and to show my mate my respect for him.'

             I want to associate myself with the words of the shadow minister and commend the military for doing what they always do so well. I pay that respect in the way that he relayed from Jack's funeral. I join with him and so many other members in this place in expressing my heartfelt condolences to the entire Fitzgibbon family for the loss of their only son and brother and for the loss of Cass's partner. I also express my condolences to all the mates of Lance Corporal Jack Patrick Fitzgibbon.

             Last Wednesday, the House came together offering comfort and love to our mate Joel, to his wonderful wife Dianne, to Caitlin, Grace and Maxine and to Jack's partner, Cass. I acknowledge all the tributes in this place today and over the last week or so. It was wonderful to meet Jack's sisters, to hug Joel and Dianne, to meet Cass and to pass on my family's love and deep condolences. He was most loved. It's so obvious to everyone, but he was an excellent special forces operator. When he joined the ADF in 2014, through mutual friends, I know that he was just getting after it. He served in the 2nd

             . He was a proud special forces operator within that command and saw operational deployment to

             . He was awarded the Defence Medal and the Australian

             for counterterrorism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Belonging to that special forces family, and due to his own characteristic modesty, we'll never really know all the details of his service and everything he achieved during his service, but his mates do. His mates know what he achieved, as do his troop commanders and his company commanders. They all know what he achieved, and the great name Fitzgibbon will live on in their ranks, honoured by a grateful nation and supported by a whole community of ADF members, soldiers and veterans.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know from Joel and from the members of the unit that he was a very experienced parachutist, which is one of the most dangerous things that is done in special forces, as the member for Canning relayed in his contribution last week. So he was a highly skilled soldier, courageous and dedicated to his mates, to his unit and to his nation. As so many of his family members and mates have said, he was incredibly humble and not boasting about being in the special forces, always playing down his own incredible accomplishments and not seeking promotion, when he was obviously so deserving of it. But, as so many of our men and women in uniform do, he put his mates and the unit first. He was a soldier's soldier, not someone that's looking up to please the boss but someone that's looking out for their mates, in the best of our country's military tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was a pride of the ADF and of our nation. At that packed service at

             Catholic Church in Cessnock last Monday—as a member relayed well—his mates remembered him, did him honour, and reflected on his infectious sense of humour and his laughter but also on him being as tough as nails and his loyalty, both to his country and to the Army. His commanding officer, his CO, said that Jack's example would inspire generations of soldiers to come. As the family, the Fitzgibbons, themselves said in a statement:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Serving in the special forces was Jack's dream job and we take some comfort from the fact that he died serving his nation in a uniform of the ADF.
            </p>
            <p>
             To Joel and the entire family: know that this entire House, this entire place, shares in your grief. None of us can ever lighten your grief, but we are all here to support you in any way we possibly can. Although I didn't know Jack personally, I knew of him through mutual friends and people in the special forces. I can tell you that this loss was significant, a great loss, and it was felt like a shockwave by the members who wear the uniform.
            </p>
            <p>
             All the soldiers and special operators accept that there's a high risk to their own personal safety in doing what they do. They not only do it willingly; they do it gladly and they do it proudly. There is no higher honour than to serve your country in uniform and to defend the security of all Australians, of the men and women of Australia, whether that be in overseas service or during exercises, during training like Jack was undertaking. It's critical that everyone in this place understands that the ADF trains like it's going to have to fight so there's always a degree of risk. The ADF does as much as it possibly can to lessen that degree of risk.
            </p>
            <p>
             I pay my respects to all Australian soldiers who have lost their lives in training accidents. I have been a military parachutist. It's pretty scary, and there's that element of danger always. So I want to pay tribute to those who have been killed or injured in accidents, including the four aviators in

             last year. I send my and my family's love—and I think this whole chamber's love—to the Fitzgibbon family and to all of Jack's friends and comrades.
            </p>
            <p>
             We will remember him. Lest we forget.

               Joel Fitzgibbon
              </a>
              , in particular, would understand that.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I left, I was just reflecting on what an adored son Jack was for both Joel and Dianne. He was of course also a loving brother for Caitlin and Grace, a darling grandson to Anne, a treasured nephew for Therese, Alison and Mark and the beloved partner of Kass. My heart and thoughts are with you all at this time. As tragic as it is to lose someone you love, the grieving rests with those who are left behind. It is that heavy heart we saw when we were really honoured to have the Fitzgibbon family join us on the floor of parliament just last week. We saw just how much grief is carried at times like this by all of those left behind who loved Jack so very, very dearly.
             </p>
             <p>
              Losing a child is of course every parent's nightmare, and no-one ever, ever expects to be burying their child. That unimaginable pain of burying a child may feel all too much to bear at times. It certainly felt like that when I was able to see the family last week. But I hope that the family and all of the people that they love who are still around them, and indeed the community in which they live, who turned out in force to celebrate Jack's life and to really wrap their arms around Jack's family—I hope that there is some comfort for the family in knowing that they are very much in the hearts and thoughts of our community, of our Labor family and indeed across the nation. We know that Jack's service meant that he had great camaraderie, great friendship, with so many people in the forces across Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know his life was cut way, way too short. His father has honoured him in saying that he knew that his son died doing what he loved and that, as terrible as that accident was, it was in the service of his nation, something that he had quite consciously signed up for. The exercise that he was involved in was one that he'd done many, many times before. It is just an unbearable pain, really, that the family is left with, but there is some comfort to be gained in knowing that this was a pathway that Jack was fully invested in and had wanted to do. He was very, very proud of that service to our nation. My thoughts are with all his loved ones at this heartbreaking time. May Jack rest in peace.

               In the serene landscapes where soldiers hone their skills, tragedy can strike unexpectedly, shattering the tranquillity and leaving behind a profound sense of loss. Such was the case in a recent training exercise where the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Defence Force
               </a>
               faced the heart-wrenching reality of bidding farewell to one of its own. In the wake of a training exercise gone awry, the Australian military community found itself grappling with the devastating loss of a dedicated soldier.
              </p>
              <p>
               The circumstances surrounding the incident serve as a stark reminder of the inherent risks that come with the noble profession of defending one's nation. As details of the event continue to emerge, the collective grief weighs heavily upon the hearts of all Australians. The loss of a soldier is not just a matter of statistics or headlines; it's a deeply personal tragedy that reverberates through the entire nation. Behind every uniform lies a story of sacrifice, courage and unwavering commitment to duty. In times like these, it is essential to pause and reflect on the profound sacrifices made by those who serve in the armed forces. Each soldier represents a cherished son or daughter, a beloved sibling, a devoted partner or a proud parent. Their courage knows no bounds as they stand ready to defend their country, often placing themselves in harm's way without any hesitation.
              </p>
              <p>
               The outpouring of support from across the country serves as a testament to the deep sense of gratitude and respect Australians hold for their servicemen and servicewomen. Through the heartfelt tributes, candlelight vigils and messages of condolence flooding social media, the nation stands united in morning the loss of a true hero. As we mourn the passing of a courageous soldier in Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon, our hearts also ache for his beloved family—Joel, Di, his sisters, Caitlin, Grace and Maxine, and his partner, Kass, their extended family and their extended friends. The Fitzgibbon family has been an indispensable pillar of the Cessnock community, and the loss of Jack will undoubtedly resonate deeply in our local circles, leaving a profound impact on us all.
              </p>
              <p>
               We must also acknowledge the inherent risks associated with military training exercises. Although every precaution is taken to ensure the safety of personnel, the unprecedented nature of warfare means that accidents can and do occur. It is a sobering reality that underscores the importance of rigorous training, constant vigilance and an unwavering commitment to safety protocols. In the aftermath of this tragedy, it is imperative that we honour the memory of Jack by redoubling our efforts to support and protect those who serve in the military. This includes not only providing them with the necessary training and equipment but also ensuring they have access to the mental health resources and support networks they need to cope with the unique challenges they face.
              </p>
              <p>
               Moreover, we must never forget the profound impact that the loss of a comrade in arms has on the entire military community. The bonds forged in the crucible of training exercises and deployments run deep, and the loss of a fellow soldier is felt acutely by all who served alongside them. It is incumbent upon us as a nation to rally around those who are grieving and offer them our unwavering support and solidarity during these difficult times. As we mourn the loss of Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon, let us reaffirm our commitment to honouring his memory by upholding the values of courage, sacrifice and service for which he so selflessly gave his life. In his memory, may we strive to build a world where peace reigns supreme and the sacrifices of our fallen heroes are never forgotten. Thank you for your service, Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon. May you rest in peace.

                Losing a child is every parent's worst fear. When such things happen, it is a fundamental tragedy. We can't make any sense of it. The loss is too great, it's inexplicable and it is raw. No parent should ever bury a child; it is against the rules of nature. Those of us on the sidelines cannot understand the depth of the pain and the grief, but as a fellow parent I have some inkling as to how it might affect Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon's loving parents and family. It can affect people differently, but, nevertheless, we ache alongside you.

                So I rise today with a heavy heart to join my parliamentary colleagues to honour Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon, who died on 7 March in that horrific military training exercise. I, along with my wife, would like to offer my heartfelt condolences to my good friend

                To volunteer to join the ADF is to volunteer to serve your country. Jack, like his fellow members of the 2nd Commando Regiment, willingly and bravely took on the risks of specialised training and then deployment. As his father had been a defence minister, Jack well and truly understood the risks he was taking on when he signed up. But Jack was an experienced parachutist, with the majority of his jumps being high-altitude military freefall, requiring skill, an incredible amount of courage and commitment. I've heard Joel say that Jack's role in defence was actually Jack's ideal job. As the Prime Minister said in his moving statement in the main chamber:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                He was numbered among the extraordinary men and women who volunteer to serve in the Australian Defence Force and do our nation proud every single day.
               </p>
               <p>
                We thank them, just as we thank Jack for his courage, conviction and commitment to Australia.
               </p>
               <p>
                I didn't know Jack but I'm proud to know his father, Joel, and I know the strong tradition of service that runs through the Fitzgibbon family. Joel represented the people of the Hunter for 26 years, following in the footsteps of his father, Eric, who then went on to serve in various other roles, including in the high commission in London. Jack's continuation of this tradition of service must make the family so proud.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the aftermath of Jack's death, I bring them this poem:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Not how did he die, but how did he live?
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Not what did he gain, but what did he give?
               </p>

                Of a person as a person, regardless of birth.

                Not what was his church, nor what was his creed?
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                But had he befriended those really in need?
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Was he ever ready, with word of good cheer,

                 St Joseph's
                </a>
                Catholic Church in Cessnock was overflowing with those who wanted to pay tribute to Jack and to be there to support his family. And this parliament, a place for the worship of democracy, is also overflowing with tributes from both sides—from all sides—of the aisle.
               </p>
               <p>
                We know that Jack was well loved. We know that death shall have no dominion when it comes to Jack's legacy of love and loyalty. Those who knew and love Jack will hold special memories forever: memories of a cherished son, a loved brother and a loving partner, and memories of a loyal friend and loyal comrade, with an infectious sense of humour. I hope that being together and remembering Jack is some sort of balm or comfort in these darkest of times for Joel and Diane.
               </p>
               <p>
                I found it hard to put these words to paper, Joel and Diane, but my wife, Lea, and I are thinking of you all, of all your family, and hoping and wishing that you will eventually find comfort in these memories and these futile, but heartfelt words. Vale Jack Fitzgibbon.

                 I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Lance Corporal Jack Patrick Fitzgibbon, a young, upstanding Australian who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving his country. His untimely passing at just 33 is a tragic loss for his family, his friends and his loved ones. It's also a tragic loss for his fellow soldiers. And it is a tragic loss for this country.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Like his father, Jack respected and loved the

                  Australian Defence Force
                 </a>
                 . As Joel recently recalled, Jack's admiration for the Army dated back to when he was just three years old. Joel had brought Jack a shirt from a recent visit to the Lone Pine Barracks near Singleton, and it was a shirt he deeply treasured. No doubt it represented something bigger—an opportunity to give back to the country he'd watched his dad serve as a politician and one from which he had enjoyed tremendous opportunities. And so Jack's decision to enlist as a young man in 2014 actually seemed to be an inevitability. He served for more than a decade, most recently as a proud member of the special forces 2nd

                </p>
                <p>
                 Lance Corporal Jack Patrick Fitzgibbon wore his uniform with pride. Australia is eternally grateful to all who serve in uniform. There really is no greater honour. For Jack's service and his ultimate sacrifice, his comrades and country stand proud, as does the greater community of the Hunter and, in particular, Cessnock, his home town. Of course, we saw an outpouring of grief from the community at his funeral last week.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I knew Jack through his dad, Joel, whom I at least met in 1996, when he was elected to this place and I was a staffer. When I was elected in 2010, he, from memory, was the Chief Government Whip. I'm so pleased that my colleague the member for Paterson is here and also the member for Shortland because, representing the Hunter region, you would have known Jack and you would have known, of course, Joel even better.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think it's fair to say to the member for Paterson that Joel and I agreed on just about everything. I think it is pretty certain that Joel and I agreed on everything, and the biggest thing that we agreed on was that, for Labor governments to obtain the honour of being elected and be long-term Labor governments, we have to govern from the centre. We have to appeal to and we have to understand people who have aspiration, and there are different forms of aspiration, depending on where you live and what your circumstances are. And you have to respect that aspiration, even when it is different from your ideology, from your point of view, from where you live or from your vantage point. It has to be respected. I am pretty certain the member for Paterson will agree with me that that is exactly what Joel instilled in all his kids, including Jack—that respect for other people.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Joel and his whole family, Eric—right through—are part of Labor royalty in
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                  New South Wales
                 </a>
                 . We talked about Jack's funeral in Cessnock; Eric was suitably sent off as well, from the same church, and we acknowledged Eric's tremendous role here. But it is for me—in the number of hats that I wear—as president of the New South Wales branch to demonstrate and to articulate in this House what a loss this is for the New South Wales branch and how much respect we have as a party for the Fitzgibbon family, and I think that that was demonstrated in Jack's send-off as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm reliably informed that in 2006 Jack even became a member of the Bellbird branch, which I'm sure was the case. Growing up—I know this for a fact—he played for the Cessnock Goannas. He was school captain at
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick's" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 primary, and, I'm also reliably informed, that's where Anne, Joel's mum, once taught as well. Lance Corporal Jack Patrick Fitzgibbon's name has been inscribed on the school's honour board, and it's a place for distinguished alumni. While his life was cut short, his achievements were immense. For this he will be remembered not only by his former school but by this country.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To this end, on behalf of the people of Greenway and on behalf of the New South Wales branch, I offer my deepest condolences to Joel and Dianne, to Caitlin and Grace and to Kass. We extend those condolences to members of the Second Commando Regiment, who are coming to terms with their great loss. Let the memory of Lance Corporal Jack Patrick Fitzgibbon live on forever, and may he rest in peace.

                 <p>
                  It's with a heavy heart that I deliver this speech on the condolence motion for Jack Fitzgibbon. Jack is the son of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">
                   Joel Fitzgibbon
                  </a>
                  , who is the person that brought me to politics, and I will be forever indebted to Joel for that. But my association with the Fitzgibbon family goes back a long way further than that. My uncle, Owen Partridge, was a stalwart in the Cessnock Labor Party. He was a branch member for many years, and I'm sure he was a pain in Joel's behind on many occasions, as well, being a staunch leftie.
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Owen" rel="nofollow">
                   Uncle Owen

                  recruited me, at the tender age of 12 or 13, to hand out for
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">
                   Eric Fitzgibbon
                  </a>
                  to become the member for Hunter. I can still remember handing out for Eric. We had posters of Eric in the garden and posters of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
                   Bob Hawke
                  </a>
                  in the hallway of the house. It was from that time that my association with the Fitzgibbon family really came about.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  My next major milestone with the Fitzgibbons was when I was on my honeymoon. I got a phone call from Joel, who said: 'You've been working with my brother Mark, through the Hunter Regional Organisation of Councils. He rates you, so I want you to come and work for me. I've just been elected.' I said, 'Thanks very much, but I'm on my honeymoon. I'll ring you in a few weeks.' I came to work for Joel in 1996, at the tender age of 25, when he replaced his father, Eric, as the member for Hunter. I remember working from the electorate office in Cessnock, and I also travelled here to Canberra with him. In that office, I met Dianne, his wife, and their three young children, and I can still remember those kids coming to the office. Jack was a full-of-energy, fantastic little boy. Caitlin, his older sister, was always there trying to pull him into line, and Gracie just tagged along as the third. I remember thinking to myself, 'How are they going to do it, with young kids?' It was so difficult, but they did do it, and they did it well.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  My relationship with this family grew over the years. The next major milestone in my life was when Joel phoned me again and said: 'Mate, I want you to run for the seat of Paterson. You probably won't win, but I know you'll give it your best.' So I did, and I then became the member for Paterson.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In this speech on the condolence motion for Jack, what I'm trying to display is that the things I say about the Fitzgibbon family don't just come from working with Joel or perhaps something I've read in the paper. I've known them and worked with them for over 40 years. I feel as though, whilst they're not my blood relatives, they're as close as I could get. When I go to their home and spend time with them, I always feel so welcome, so I can't tell you the pain I felt, going to Joel and Di's place on the Monday after we lost Jack and seeing their faces. Seeing that torture, that pain, on a parent's face when they lose a child—it's indescribable. It goes against everything that we know to bury a child. I can't begin to express my heartfelt grief and condolence for that family, who in their own way have served our nation so well, whether it be here in parliament, battling it out, or, like Jack, putting on the uniform.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There is no greater service to your country than potentially laying down your life. Although Jack was a commando, it still came as such a shock. People talk about the risk of service. Of course jumping out of an aeroplane comes with risk, but you never think that anything terrible is actually going to happen, and when it does it is still so shocking. I also went to Holsworthy to visit the commandos, the special forces of the 2nd
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
                   Commando Regiment
                  </a>
                  , and let me tell you: they are outstanding, stellar human beings. The men and women that pull on that uniform, just like Jack did, to serve us all and keep us safe are special human beings. Then I had that out-of-body experience, being in
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph's" rel="nofollow">
                   St Joseph's
                  </a>
                  at Cessnock for Jack's funeral, and I was sat behind a wall of khaki. These enormous men were standing in front of me and each of them had a look of pain and horror on their face. It was just an incredible moment in my life that I will never forget. But each of them bravely listened to stories of Jack, knowing that the next day they would take off the ceremonial uniform, pull back on the khaki and go back to work for each one of us again.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That's what Jack did. He wasn't really like his dad or his grandfather in that he wasn't an out-there, public person. He loved a drink, like his dad and his grandfather, and he loved a joke and he loved a dance. He was a really funny, good guy. But he wasn't a public person like his grandfather and father. He was a far more private person. He didn't want to be promoted; he just wanted to do his job. And he did that every day in that uniform.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I know Joel and Dianne, his parents, were incredibly proud of him, and so was Anne, his grandmother. I thought about her a lot during this time as well because I know she always had a special soft spot for Jack. I know grandparents can't have favourites, but I know Anne always had a special soft spot for Jack. So I have thought a lot about that. As the member for Greenway pointed out, that family have contributed so much to Australian politics and Australian life and given more than any family should have to give in the life of their son. But I want to thank them for that, and I want them to know that Jack's memory and his contribution will never be forgotten. I suspect that the people who worked with him will be forever compelled to give their best, as Jack did, and will be forever indebted to his memory, as we all are.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On behalf of the people of Paterson, on behalf of the broader Hunter community and on behalf of our Labor family, I commend Jack's memory to the history books and to

                  . I hope that he finds eternal peace, and I hope that his family find some peace in these words too.

                   It is with great sadness that I join the debate to express my condolences on behalf of the people of Gippsland. In doing so, I want to associate myself with the heartfelt comments the member for Paterson just delivered in this chamber. The member for Paterson's right: there is no greater service that anyone can give to our nation than to put on the uniform of the Navy, Army or
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
                    Air Force
                   </a>
                   and potentially place themselves in harm's way to help Australians or our compatriots who can't necessarily help themselves. Putting on that uniform is a sign that you love your country, you love your mates and you are prepared to do whatever it takes to protect this extraordinary country that we all live in.
                  </p>

                   Jack Fitzgibbon served in the

                    Australian Defence Force

                   for over 10 years, with six years in the special forces 2nd

                   . As we have heard, he was the son of Joel—a great friend of many in this place—and Dianne, brother to Grace and Maxine and partner to Kass. He deployed to assist his fellow Australians in the floods in 2022 and prior to that was deployed to

                   </a>
                   . Amongst his many skills we've heard about in this place was his experience as a parachutist, having done 106 jumps, with 95 into military freefall. He was a reluctant leader. He was certainly identified as a leader by men and women in uniform alongside him. He was promoted to lance corporal in 2023.

                   Last week I think we saw the federal parliament at its best when the Fitzgibbon family was here for the condolence motion, when the Prime Minister, the opposition leader, the defence minister and the shadow defence minister spoke so eloquently not only about Jack Fitzgibbon but about all the men and women who serve, thanking them for that service. It was an important moment because we had our friend and former member of parliament
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   in the chamber to hear the words. Joel was one of those unusual characters in this building who had friends on both sides of the House. He was able to cross the political divide, not unlike the members opposite here today. He had the capacity to reach out across that political divide, to put away any false enmities and to focus on what was good for the future of Australia. And, like the member for Paterson, I was shocked and appalled to hear of Jack's death. I didn't know Jack—clearly, she did—but to think of a father having to bury their own son is tragic.
                  </p>

                   Obviously, Gippslanders understand the nature of military service. We have

                   , and has also known tragedy in its time. Sadly, we had six people killed with the Red Sales aerobatic team in 1962—it's a long time now—when those aircraft went into the ground in Gippsland. I was reminded of that when the shadow minister for defence talked about the fact that, as much our Australian Defence Force personnel are incredibly professional and skilled, training accidents do happen. Training accidents are rare, thankfully—thank God that they're rare—but, tragically, they do happen. And they happen because our Australian Defence Force has to train at the edge to make sure they're ready in times of crisis. So if they're to be deployed, they need to be able to demonstrate that they've learned the skills, that they trust those skills and that they trust their mates. They practice those skills so they can deliver them at the time they're required.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We heard last week that Jack Fitzgibbon died doing what he loved. In truth, our Australian Defence Force personnel don't really have one family: they have two families. They have their actual mum and dad and siblings; that's one family they have. But they have their family at work, in uniform. I have been privileged over the last 10 years to spend some time with a lot of Australian Defence Force personnel. For someone who had never had the capacity or the willingness—perhaps not even the courage—to serve in uniform, to spend time with the men and women of the Navy, Army and Air Force as a minister and assistant minister has been an extraordinary privilege. But I also had some time with 2nd Commando Regiment during my time as the veterans' and Defence Force personnel minister. In fact, they provided the protection detail for me in Afghanistan, and I felt to be in very safe hands for the time that I was in Afghanistan and Iraq. There were some in my own party who would rather that they didn't bring me back safely but, thankfully, they did! But what I can say from the time I spent alongside these men and women—often very young men and women—is that whether they're deployed in a conflict zone, or in humanitarian aid and disaster relief, or whether it's in defence assistance to the civilian community in the Asia-Pacific region, they are so highly regarded around the world. They are respected, acknowledged and recognised for their professionalism, their capacity to get the job done and their leadership—often in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. I have to say, without any shadow of doubt, that the finest leaders I have met in my time as a member of parliament have been those young men and women in uniform. They're highly skilled, they're patriotic, they're determined, they're passionate and they don't let their mates down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So my heart goes out to the Fitzgibbon family, and also to Jack Fitzgibbon's other family: the men and women in the Australian Defence Force. Lest we forget.

                    It's a privilege to contribute to this very sad debate, and I want to echo the fine words from the member for Gippsland, who demonstrated the respect for public service that this House holds and the affection we hold for

                    in this place. The member for Gippsland spoke about the connections through his electorate, but also about his service in a ministerial role here. I think that, for me, that's one of the things I want to reflect on: the tragic interaction of those two things which, in this particular case, makes it even more poignant.

                    that lists the over 100,000 Australians who've died fighting for our country. They fought and died for many reasons, but one of the most common was the fight for democracy both here and around the world. That is a theme—the Democratic tradition—I will come back to in my remarks. I wanted to start with that rite of passage to Canberra to see the Roll of Honour and then the parliament to see the heart of Australian democracy.

                    I had the privilege of being one of the mourners at the memorial service last week in Cessnock. I think it was a real privilege. I know that I can say that every member of the Labor family would have liked to have been there to pay tribute, but there were limited numbers. It was a privilege to be there to pay tribute to Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon.

                   <p>
                    One of the things that struck me at that service, although I knew it intellectually, was that you cannot have Cessnock without the Fitzgibbons. Cessnock is the heart of the

You've got the football team that three generations of Fitzgibbons played for, the Cessnock Goannas, who are part of the real

                    , 'Newcastle rugby league'. You can't have an NRL without the Cessnock Goannas and the three generations of Fitzgibbons who've played there. Then you have the Fitzgibbon family. For me, without trying to be disrespectful, they are the sort of holy trinity of Cessnock—St Joseph's Catholic Church, the Cessnock Goannas and the Fitzgibbon family. That struck me on that day.

                    There were hundreds of people in the church. There were hundreds of people outside the church trying to view proceedings remotely. When there was the march behind the gun carriage, people came out from their houses to pay their respects on their front verandahs. Such was the legacy of Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon and the respect for him and his family.

                    Jack was continuing the noble tradition of his family's public service. It's been remarked upon, I daresay, by every speaker the role of

                    , and then obviously Joel Fitzgibbon became the member for Hunter in 1996, only retiring from that seat at this election after decades of service, including ministerial roles. Jack was continuing that family tradition not in politics but in serving the country through being part of the

                    </a>
                    . His comrades talked about his passion at that memorial service and the fact that when Jack joined up he had one goal, which was to be the best soldier he could be and to be part of the special forces and to join the 2nd

                    </a>
                    . His commanding officer, in his eulogy, talked about how Jack was a gold standard signaller. Signalling is a military specialty that's essential. It's very hard for the other arms of the military to work without having signallers by their side, and he was a gold standard signaller for the 2nd Commando Regiment. He was also a natural leader, as has been remarked upon. He was not someone who put himself forward for formal leadership roles, but people looked to him to lead and he always stepped up.

                    I pass on my condolences to all of Jack's comrades in the 2nd Commando Regiment. I am dreadfully sorry for your loss. I know you are all feeling it. To lose someone in a training accident is just heartbreaking. I think part of the tragedy of this is that, while we have lost over 100,000 Australians in war, we have lost many more in training accidents as the ADF work very hard to maintain that level of readiness and that level of capability that you can only have by embracing risk in peacetime to minimise risk in wartime. That's unfortunately the circumstance in which Jack was training and where he tragically lost his life. I think another part of why this is so particularly sad is the resonance with Joel Fitzgibbon's former role as Minister for Defence. I worked alongside Joel when he was Minister for Defence while I was a staffer for

                    , the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement at the time. The tragic irony abounds that one of the hardest parts of Joel's job was ringing families when they had lost a family member in the ADF. And so for Joel—and the Deputy Prime Minister remarked upon this in his contribution—to be on both ends of that phone call, to have made that call to ADF families and to receive that call as an ADF family, is particularly poignant.

                   <p>
                    I think the character of the pain for this place is particularly resonant. I think it's particularly personal here. Every loss of an ADF member is tragic. It's the loss of someone's son or daughter, brother or sister, mum or dad, and it leaves a vacuum. It leaves a massive hole in a family. But we almost feel like—and, hopefully, I'm not being too forward here—it has left a hole in the parliamentary family, such was the affection for Joel in this place. That affection is important, as it's held by many people who didn't always agree with what Joel stood for. He had his blues, both across the aisle and also within the party room. It's well known that Joel and I had a few disagreements in our time here, but they all came from a good place—that we all wanted the best for the country and, certainly within the caucus, we wanted the best for the Labor Party. After all those things we had a beer and we all worked for a common direction, which was the election of a Labor government to improve Australia. But I think no matter whether you disagreed with Joel on any particular issue, you always knew that he was passionate about improving this country. That's why the loss here was so particularly poignant.

                    can reflect on parliament last week: we saw it at its best, with a condolence motion led by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. And it continued with the Deputy Prime Minister, the defence minister and the shadow defence minister. To have Joel, Di, Caitlin, Grace, Maxine and Kass there was just heartbreaking, but really, really important.

                    I'll return to my first point in conclusion: it's why I think there's a symmetry in what we're talking about here today. There are school excursions to see the Roll of Honour, a reminder of the loss of life of people who have made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve democracy. They then visit the heart of democracy, which is the

                    . Last week we saw on a very personal level the service in Cessnock to commemorate the life of Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon, and then we saw the parliamentary condolence motion in front of Jack's family, continuing and ending today.

                    I say on behalf of the 150,000 constituents of Shortland, who I have the honour to represent; on behalf of the members of the Hunter Labor caucus, who are very close and who work very closely together—and I have the member for Paterson sitting behind me; on behalf the broader Labor family; and on behalf of all of the parliament that I pass on my condolences to Joel, Di, Caitlin, Grace, Maxine and Jack's partner, Kass. We are dreadfully sorry for your loss. We are incredibly grateful for the service of Jack and the service of your family. But, please, may Jack rest in peace. Vale Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon.

                     Deputy Speaker Chesters, I'm very grateful for your forbearance in allowing me to add some words here. The Fitzgibbon family, as everyone well knows, are a very close-knit, tight family. Having known
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Fitzgibbon" rel="nofollow">

                     , not just as a parliamentarian but well before my time as a parliamentarian, I know how strongly he felt for all his kids, but that particularly he felt a deep pride about their achievements and accomplishments. I think it's a truism for anyone who's a parent that no parent should be put in the position that both he and Di have been put in. They had great hopes, obviously, for Jack. I know, from times speaking with Joel, how deeply proud he felt of his son. The member for Paterson and I were reflecting on this just in the last 24 hours. In the member for Paterson's case, she got to see all those kids grow up and was very close to them. As much as it deeply impacted on many of us, I do particularly feel for the member for Paterson, given her close relationship and friendship with Joel Fitzgibbon.

                    <p>
                     I take on board what has been expressed by a number of contributions, regardless of politics, that have been made in the course of this debate. In particular, the words expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence weighed heavily, talking about the invidious position in which ministers for defence are sometimes placed, where they're required to call on the families of those who have served in deep sincerity to the nation and have lost their lives in the course of that service. I know that Joel had to make those calls in times past. I'm also aware that the families, as heavy as those calls were, greatly appreciated the words expressed by Joel and, more importantly the sentiments that underpinned them and the sincerity with which they were delivered. Joel would never have expected to be in the position where he was receiving that call himself, and I do recall the Deputy Prime Minister expressing that during his contribution to this condolence motion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     As I said, I'm very grateful for the indulgence, Deputy Speaker Chesters, but I did want to express to the entirety of the Fitzgibbon family—not just to Joel as a deep friend, a great friend, of mine but to his whole family—that we feel the weight of what they've gone through, as we do with everyone who serves the nation in the ADF who does not get to continue that service due to their life being shortened prematurely. To the Fitzgibbon family, we extend our deepest condolences, but, just as much, we extend our deep gratitude for the service of their son, Jack.
