        I rise today to record the sad passing of renowned Hunter winemaker
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Drayton" rel="nofollow">
         Trevor Drayton
        </a>
        . He was killed in tragic circumstances at the Drayton winery in Pokolbin on 17 January 2008. Eddie Orgo was also killed and William Rikard-Bell was left with burns to 80 per cent of his body. Trevor was not only an industry leader, renowned the country over, but also a personal friend. Trevor will be sadly missed, not only by me but by his many friends and of course his close-knit family. Trevor was the beloved son of Max and Caroline Drayton and the cherished partner of Abesi Mwenda. Trevor was a much loved brother, brother-in-law and uncle to John and Jan, Greg and Chris, Peter and Leesa, and their families. Trevor’s work in the community was outstanding and he leaves the legacy of a man who made a difference well beyond his incredible contribution to the wine industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trevor was regarded not only as an iconic winemaker but also as a man who gave much to his community. Trevor was once transferred by the Westpac rescue helicopter and, until his death, he worked tirelessly to repay that debt. Since then the Drayton family has become a major sponsor of the helicopter service, providing wines for special occasions to help boost the finances for the organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trevor never had any doubt he would carry on the family tradition of winemaking. He always wanted to be a winemaker and all his energies were aimed in that direction. In 1973 Trevor left home to attend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseworthy_Agricultural_College" rel="nofollow">
         Roseworthy Agricultural College
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        to start a five-year course in oenology. In his time at Roseworthy, Trevor topped his second year and won a silver medal, topped his third year and won a gold medal, and topped his final year and was awarded dux of the course.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon his return, he took up the position of winemaker for the family business. He produced many classic wines, including ‘William’ Shiraz, ‘Caroline’ Sparkling Burgundy, ‘Maxwell’ Shiraz and ‘Suzanne’ Semillon, but the most notable was the 1985 ‘Joseph’ Shiraz, which was awarded the Douglas Seabrook Memorial Trophy for best red wine in show at the 1995 Royal Melbourne Wine Show.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trevor was past president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Valley
        </a>
        Vineyard Association and was instrumental in the push for federal government funding, through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Tourism Australia
        </a>
        , after the devastating floods in June last year. The Drayton family are one of the Hunter Valley’s pioneering winemaking families, and Drayton is one of the few companies that are still family owned and operated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trevor had a dream: to build a Hunter wine museum that would show the proud heritage of wine in the region and to display the equipment that pioneered the industry as we know it today. I will be speaking to other members from the Hunter region to help bring Trevor’s dream to reality. This would be a tribute not only to Trevor but to all who came before him and all who will come after him. May his soul rest in peace.
