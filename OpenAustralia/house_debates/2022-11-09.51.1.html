       <p>
        Last Sunday afternoon, I attended the Little Climate Heroes Playgroup organised by Australian Parents for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Action" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Action
        </a>
        . There I was grilled by some very well-informed children who asked me questions about politics, about elections and about Canberra. They asked me how much paperwork was involved in being a local member, how to influence politicians and, particularly, how they can tell if politicians will actually do what they say they're going to do. They also told me what they cared about, and climate action was No. 1, but they also cared about fairness and a fair go for everyone. They showed me their community garden with their bumper crop of lettuce and strawberries, and they talked about what they're doing to make a difference in their community, like riding their bikes and growing their own food.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was great to spend time with these kids, who are our future leaders. Their understanding and care for the environment, for the world around them and for the lives of others show that the world will be in good hands. Many thanks to Peter and Eleanor, Hamish and Rachel, Alpa and Conal, Rose and Thomas, Nathan and Jayden, Isla and Ninna, Albie and Fergus, Nola and Luca, Eddie, Leo and Matilda, and Rose and Alfie, and, of course, thanks to their parents for organising the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian Parents for Climate Action is a national group of parents who care about the future we are leaving for our children, and this is a great way to kick off their national month of action.
