        The Prime Minister is a very smart man—you just have to ask him. But there are two questions he can't answer. Why did he stuff up the

        and why can't he fix it? He's got no idea and, of course, he doesn't really care, because he's enjoying 100 megabits per second download speeds over in

        rollout to reach them. It was supposed to happen by June in parts of Chifley, including Glendenning, but now they've been told, 'No, that's not happening but we'll get there as soon as we can in 2020.' 2020! They have to put up with appalling speeds until that time. Kids can't do their homework or do any of the research they want, and home based small businesses can't do their work—so much for jobs and growth.

        I have received similar complaints from people in Marayong. They have been told the same thing by NBN: 'A build is planned in your area,' but when they ask their service providers there is no information as to when that is happening. Mark from

        , who works part time from home and relies on the internet, has download speeds—get this—of 0.150 megabits per second. You can imagine how frustrated he is. These are just a few of the examples of the countless complaints I am receiving. It's time the government gave residents the NBN they deserve.
