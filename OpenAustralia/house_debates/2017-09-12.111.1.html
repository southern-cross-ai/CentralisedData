       <p>
        Recently, on Saturday, 2 September, I had the pleasure of attending two noteworthy anniversaries in my electorate of Dunkley. Firstly, the Bayside Christian College community in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langwarrin_South" rel="nofollow">
         Langwarrin South
        </a>
        are, this year, celebrating the 35th anniversary of their school. The association of Christian parents own, govern and set out the strategy and direction for the school, which caters for just under 600 students. The college has been at its site in Langwarrin South for 33 years, and the school and facilities continue to expand to provide an array of opportunities for the students and the wider college community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year I had the opportunity to inspect the site of the new buildings and car park for the school, for which the federal government has provided funding to the tune of $350,000. Next week I will also be representing Assistant Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_Education" rel="nofollow">

        and Skills,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Andrews" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , at the opening of the skills trade centre, which the federal government has also put over $1.5 million into, bringing our total recent contribution to the school to over $3.55 million. I commend Bayside Christian College's Principal, Dr Christopher Prior, and the college's staff on the growth of their school both in numbers and in values over the years, and I look forward to having continued involvement with Bayside Christian College for the years to come.
       </p>

        That same evening, I joined with the committee and members of the Mornington Bowling Club to mark the 100th anniversary. My wife, Grace, and I attended a gala dinner at their clubhouse overlooking
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Phillip" rel="nofollow">
         Port Phillip
        </a>
        , hosted by the club's board of management and the bowls committee. In the beautifully set-out room in the patriotic club colours of green and gold, we were treated to a dinner with representatives from the surrounding district and regional bowls organisations to acknowledge past members and the current 188 members of the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club began on 1 June 1917, and a four-rink green was opened that November. The club has faced some difficulties over the years, particularly with watering and maintaining the green in its infancy. However, as demonstrated by the busy room that night, I am thrilled that the club has successfully fought to overcome any initial difficulties, has grown and has been a very successful club over the past century. I was delighted to speak on this occasion and was also honoured to receive a gift of a pair of glasses commemorating the club's anniversary, which I noted would be about the only matching pair left in our household with a two-year-old. A toast to

        the Queen rounded off a very enjoyable night. We have an extensive sporting community in Dunkley, as well as a very strong community sector, and I'm thrilled that Mornington Bowling Club is able to be a steady part of it.
