        It is with sadness that I note the passing of Lamert Young, commonly known as Cyril. I feel very blessed to have known Cyril. I first met him on the campaign trail prior to the 2010 federal election. Despite Cyril's serious illness, he was always willing to give up his time for me to share some of his wisdom. He made an outstanding contribution to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">

        community. He spent a large portion of his time raising large amounts of money for charity and helping those less fortunate than himself. Cyril was a proud member of the Freemasons, the

        and the

        seniors association and was also president of the Royal Commonwealth Society's Northern Territory branch. Cyril was born on 17 February 1927 and passed away on 7 January this year. I am sure Cyril is up in heaven now, watching down on parliament with a smile on his faceâ€”he was an avid question time watcher. Our sincerest condolences go to Cyril's wife, Paula; his children, Jane and Chris; his sons-in-law, John and Mark; and his grandchildren, Alison, Alana, Daniel, Jeremy and Brandon. As is always the way, you do not miss your water until the well runs dry. Thank you, Cyril, for your guidance. May your memory never fade.
