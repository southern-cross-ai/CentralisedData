        The Queen's Birthday honours have once again recognised outstanding members of the Macquarie community. Dr Bridget 'Breda' Carty has been made an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Officer of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her work for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in education and research, including being on the writing team for the first national Auslan curriculum for schools. Breda's efforts have benefited the wider community and raised awareness about what can be achieved by sheer persistence and determination. Congratulations, Breda.
       </p>
       <p>
        John Hardie's significant work, including highlighting the importance of curiosity and cross-disciplinary cooperation in science education, has led to his recognition as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , and I commend him on his decades of involvement in professional societies as both a member and an office bearer.
       </p>

        I met

        aD event in Katoomba, inspiring teachers and librarians to share the joy of reading, and I'm thrilled that she's been awarded the

         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for that amazing initiative.

        Phillip Isaacs has been recognised with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for services to the community through a range of roles, including as the driver of important Rotary projects, including one on homelessness. His award is very well deserved.
       </p>
       <p>
        An OAM has also been received by Frances Maguire, particularly for her work in organisations dedicated to reducing violence against women and her contributions through the Bobby Goldsmith Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dharug woman Coralie Richmond is as active in her 80s as she was in her 40s, I think, and her list of community service, especially to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        , is extraordinary, from teaching to being a director of the Blue Mountains Aboriginal Cultural and Resource Centre and volunteering with the Salvos during the recent fires. It's a joy to see her recognised with an OAM.
       </p>
       <p>
        Advocating for veterans has been central to Brian Turner's life, and his recognition with the Medal of the Order of Australia is absolutely fitting. I'd like to note the huge amount of work he put in following the fire at Katoomba
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        . Brian played an intrinsic role in the success in rebuilding and refitting that RSL for veterans following a very sad event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Three meritorious awards were also presented this year. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        was awarded to Chief Inspector Sean McDermott, with specific mention of his role in improving the police response to victims of domestic violence. Murray West's work, including through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Summer" rel="nofollow">
         Black Summer
        </a>
        bushfires, has resulted in his receiving the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fire_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Fire Service Medal
        </a>
        . And the Ambulance Service Medal was awarded to Michelle Shiel, including for her contribution to New South Wales Ambulance's operational response during those same fires.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank each and every one of these women and men for their commitment to our community in so many different ways and congratulate them on their recognition.
