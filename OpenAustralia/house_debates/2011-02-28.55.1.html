        I rise this afternoon to recognise and remember the wonderful life of Harold William Smithâ€”known to all of those who knew him in the local area as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Harry Smith
        </a>
        . Harry passed away on 8 February at 80 years of age. He was married to his wife Barbara for 58 years. He was a devoted husband and father to their seven children. He lived for 60 years in our local community. He was a family man and a community man. He was a great servant of this country. He was a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" rel="nofollow">
         Korean War
        </a>
        veteran and served Australia with distinction. He followed up that service with still further service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , serving on the state executive for many years and at the community level working hard to re-establish the Lilydale RSL, which today is such a strong organisation. In his later years he also worked with the Monbulk RSL. He will be sadly missed by his family and his community. As I said, he was a family man, a community, a quintessential Australian who will always be remembered for his wonderful contribution to our local area and our nation.
