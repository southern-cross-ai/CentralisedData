        Every member of parliament has members of the community who are very special. Today I would like to talk about one of the very special people in the Shortland electorate. This person has made an enormous contribution not only locally but throughout Australia. That person is Leon Burwell. On 7 February I went to a tribute lunch for Leon Burwell. Leon has touched the lives of so many
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Special Olympics
        </a>
        athletes. Leon was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        in January 2006 for his services to sport through a range of organisations, but particularly for his support of athletes with an intellectual disability. He comes from Valentine in the Shortland electorate, and he has been the driving force behind Special Olympics in the Hunter since 1981. He was largely responsible for bringing Special Olympics to Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I am sure other members know, Special Olympics was established in 1976 as an arm in Australia of a movement started in America in 1962. Before Leon retired he was a lecturer at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_University" rel="nofollow">
         Newcastle University
        </a>
        , a person who had been involved in sport all his life. He was an assistant coach of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Falcons" rel="nofollow">
         Newcastle Falcons
        </a>
        , and since retiring he has worked tirelessly with Special Olympics throughout Australia. He is the type of person that gets so much out of watching special olympians achieve, helping them to reach their potential. He has set up programs in a wide range of areas. Of course his love is basketball, but he has also set up programs for track and field, swimming, soccer and gymnastics. When I attended the testimonial luncheon for Leon on the 7th, person after person stood up and spoke about his contribution to Special Olympics, not only in Australia but internationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as being involved in the Special Olympics, he has been a member of Lions for many, many years. In 2011 he got the national volunteer award in the Shortland electorate. In paying tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_I" rel="nofollow">
         Leon I
        </a>
        have to also mention his wife Pat, who has also been involved in the Special Olympics. She has always been there to hand out the medals as he undertook the main work.
