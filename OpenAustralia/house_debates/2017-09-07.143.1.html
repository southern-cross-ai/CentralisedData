        In any free society, freedom of association is critical. But, as with any freedom, there are countervailing costs: an obligation to ensure that the freedoms enjoyed by many are enjoyed by all. My community has always believed in freedom. On 27 August at 8 am, while many were still celebrating Warringah rugby's first ever
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shute_Shield" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , nearly 4,000 people celebrated their freedom by running in the 25th Pub2Pub Charity Fun Run and Walk from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Why" rel="nofollow">

        to Newport, on the northern beaches of Sydney. I must confess that I have considered reporting the organisers of this event to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        for misleading and deceptive advertising as the run no longer starts at a pub; nor does it end at a pub. However, it must be said that, despite clear directions, an unusually large number of runners still somehow seem to find their way to the Newport Arms. Perhaps over time they will familiarise themselves with the route.
       </p>
       <p>
        The history of the Pub2Pub is a great one. Twenty-five years ago to the day, the Bayfields decided to have a run that started at the Dee Why pub and finished at the Newport pub. True to form when it comes to the Bayfields, it was initially a bit of fun between a few mates to raise a couple of bucks for some local charities. What once involved a few, now involves nearly 4,000 runners and raises close to $400,000, because at the heart of our community is the idea that 'of those to whom much is given, much is expected'.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was great to see Mark Bayfield and his wife at the start and, I stress, at the end of this fun run. I'm not suggesting he got there other than on his own two feet, but, when you consider that he had just enjoyed watching his beloved Rats win their first ever Shute Shield premiership, he is the true champion here. We can all learn from this superhuman effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fun run comes together because of the efforts of a whole range of volunteers, mostly sourced from local voluntary organisations. To Brookvale Rotary's President Brian Dunphy, Treasurer John Emmett, Tony Eldridge-Smith and Dick Heintz who organised everything that involved starting: thank you. And congratulations to Yvonne Meillor, who won first prize in the Rotary raffle—a two-week holiday for seven people in Bali. She made a lot of new friends that day!
       </p>
       <p>
        The Upper Northern Beaches Rotary Club started the six-kilometre run, and did so with a whole range of side entertainment, including calisthenics before the start. I have never really understood why people want to do exercise before going for a run. However, if I were to do so, I would want to be led by two giant blue men standing on top of a truck! It just seems to add an appropriate level of seriousness to the whole exercise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kailas Chidambaram, his son Patrick and his grandson showed me how to properly start a race. Thank you. To Simon Masman and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Baxter" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and a number of other people—there are too many to mention—thank you. Of course, overseeing all this organised chaos is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson" rel="nofollow">
         Phil Jackson
        </a>
        . Phil has been the event manager and organiser for a while now and, as he said, maybe it just seems longer than it really is. You can see why this event keeps getting better and better, with competitors like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Little" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Little
        </a>
        and Bill Eccles, who have run virtually every race in the 25 years. When I asked them how they felt at the end of the race, they said, 'Well, I feel like a beer.' Outshining both of their efforts was Nixon Nelson, who, at just two years of age, led his mother Reegan—a three-time winner—throughout the race. Now of course Reegan is going to claim that this was because she was pushing the pram in which Nixon was sitting; however, such excuses are beneath a true champion. To Jack Colvreavy and Jenny Wickham, congratulations on your win.

        And let us not forget the sponsors who are giving so much to charities such as Sunnyfield, Manly's Bear Cottage, Children's Cancer Institute, Life Education and
