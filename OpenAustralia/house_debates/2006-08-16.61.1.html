        My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister inform the House what the government is doing to ensure Australian history is well taught in our schools? Have state governments been supportive of the need for Australian students to know the history of our country?

         I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I know that as a former economics and history teacher he is very interested in this issue. The teaching of Australian history in our schools has been downgraded. In fact, in a number of schools it is not even an optional extra. I announced recently that I would be hosting a summit to find ways to strengthen the teaching of Australian history in our schools, and that summit will be held in Canberra tomorrow. I have invited leading historians and public figures who are supporting the teaching of Australian history in our schools. I invited education leaders and teachers, including the President of the History Teachers Association of Australia. Eminent historians

         We on this side of the House believe it is time for a renaissance in the teaching of Australian history. Students need to know more about our national story. If they can better understand the past, they will be more informed citizens of the future. The summit will focus on what is currently being taught and how and on what should be taught and why. Yes, I have written to all state and territory education ministers seeking their input. I have not had a response from any except the minister in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">

I want to work collaboratively with the state and territory governments and with education authorities to ensure that Australian history is a key component in every school curriculum.

            I was saying that what we are seeking to do is strengthen the teaching of Australian history in our schools. I was astonished to read in the
            <i>
             Australian
            </i>
            newspaper—admittedly, it was the
            <i>
             Australian
            </i>
            , so the Leader of the Opposition will not have read this national newspaper—an article on 6 July headed ‘Beazley against history revival’. It reads:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            KIM Beazley has dismissed the push ... to reinstate the teaching of traditional Australian history in schools as an “elite preoccupation”.
           </p>
           <p>
            I ask the Leader of the Opposition: what is elite about learning about our diggers at Gallipoli? What is elite about learning of the struggles of our early settlers? What is elite about the establishment of a liberal democracy in this country?
