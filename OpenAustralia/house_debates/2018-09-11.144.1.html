        Sunshine Sugar, which has mills in both Broadwater and Harwood in my community, will be the first in the world to install technology that can produce a low-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GI" rel="nofollow">
         GI
        </a>
        sugar. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" rel="nofollow">
         World Health Organization
        </a>
        , this low-GI sugar, which is also rich in antioxidants, will be a game changer. It is designed to help combat the global obesity and diabetes epidemic by giving healthy options to consumers worldwide. This will also be a great benefit for our cane farm contractors and our 600 growers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Northern Rivers is the origin of sugarcane growing in Australia and will continue to create local jobs. Sunshine Sugar is a 100 per cent local product. The cane is 100 per cent locally grown, and the industry employs over 1,000 people. It contributes over $200 million to our local economy. I congratulate the team at Sunshine sugar for being an industry leader with this new product.

        This week, Chatsworth Island Public School celebrates its 150th birthday. When the school opened in 1868, Mr Albert Gale, who was the school's first teacher, would row along the river and pick up the then 32 students and take them to school. The anniversary celebrations will include photos, memorabilia displays, time lines, student performances, games, stalls and a barbecue to catch up with old friends. I'd like to extend my well wishes to the organising committee: Greg Speirs, the current principal; ex-student and local farmer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Lewis" rel="nofollow">

        ; president of the P&amp;C, Sahanti Tyas-Tunggal; vice-president, Tenille Wiblen; secretary, Chanel Small; and current staff, Kylie Shannon, Michelle Adey, Yvette West, Narelle O'Connell, Roz Connor, Lynette Towell and Darryl Skinner, as well as all the students and parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        This school prides itself on a strong community spirit. Principal Speirs says, 'At Chatty, it is one in, all in.' All the children know each other. The school has that old-school feel and teaches good manners to all. Everyone is encouraged to be involved in the school with class programs, assisting in the canteen and helping with sports carnivals and assemblies. 'Justice for All' is the school motto, which ensures that all students are given the best education possible. I'd like to congratulate Chatsworth Island Public School on its 150th anniversary. Well done, Chatty!
