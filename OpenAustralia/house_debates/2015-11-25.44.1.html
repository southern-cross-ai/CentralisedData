        This year we have seen the issue of domestic violence rise to the top of local and national media and to the top of Australians' minds. All people should be able to live free from violence. I will say that again: all people should be able to live free from violence. However, today, on White Ribbon Day, we are taking a stand against violence against women. Thank you to the community organisations in my electorate that support women and children, particularly Encircle and Zonta. Earlier this year, we, as the federal government, had great success in ensuring that Encircle's funding was extended for another two years, thanks to the great work that they do. With the help of the Minister for Women and of our local community, we managed to raise over $3,000 for Zonta projects as well. Both of these organisations have held events in the electorate of Petrie today. Well done to them.

        I think of one of the latest abuse cases that has hit the headlinesâ€”a 23-year-old male found guilty of shooting his partner's seven-year-old child in the head. Yesterday, there was a story on the front page of
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courier_Mail" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
        </i>
        in which it was reported that another man was accused of an horrific crime against a child as well. It is a disgrace that, in this year alone, 78 women have been murdered in family violence across Australia since January. Some of these murders were committed violently in public places. I say to the men in my electorate: let's protect the women in our lives. If you need help, call 1800RESPECT.
