        The Montville Memorial Gates is a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        memorial with a difference. The gates honour not only the six individuals from Montville who fell during the war and the 33 young men from Montville who served but also the six who tried to join up and were rejected for medical or occupational reasons. It is a sign of how close-knit the Montville community has always been and, I'm proud to say, still is.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1929, the memorial was unveiled by local woman
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        , who had no fewer than six sons who went to war. At the ceremony, schoolchildren sang 'God Save the King' and were provided with a bag of lollies, an apple and a cake for their troubles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, I had the privilege to take part in a ceremony that was not so different, despite the 100-year separation, to officially open the gate's extensive renovations. These renovations were supported with a grant of $10,000 from the Morrison government saluting their service and some money from the local council. I was proud to join

        , the president of the Montville Village Association, Councillor Winston Johnston and local schoolchildren to tell of many of the stories mentioned on the gates, particularly the story of one of the six men from Montville who died a century ago, and to celebrate the fact that, thanks to the Morrison government's support, their renovated memorial can now continue to stand to honour them for another 100 years to come.
