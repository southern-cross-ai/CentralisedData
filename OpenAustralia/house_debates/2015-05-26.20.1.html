        The people of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        deserve a future where they can live and work locally, so today I rise to call on the Labor Party to support this really important vision—a vision shared by tens of thousands of people right across my electorate who commute every day to Sydney or Newcastle for work. That is why they voted for a government that is delivering jobs growth and opportunity; but, sadly, the Labor Party want to hold the Central Coast back, and I want to know why their former Labor representative—now Senator Deborah O'Neill in the other place—comes out complaining about a plan for 600 jobs in Gosford.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to know why the Labor member for Franklin has confirmed that Labor opposes our National Stronger Regions Fund, a fund that has ensured the future of the Somersby Industrial Park with a $10 million grant to assist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford City Council
        </a>
        with improving the roads and infrastructure around it so it is business ready and encourages new business to the coast. Economic modelling provided by council shows that upgrading this park could provide more than 3,000 jobs and bring a $267 million boost to the local economy. Imagine that. Imagine a future where the Somersby Industrial Park could one day rival Norwest or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Park
        </a>
        in Sydney. And this is not too far away; construction will start within weeks and be business ready in around two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        You would think the Labor Party would back this important initiative instead of complaining and opposing significant initiatives that are good for the coast. I call on Senator Deborah O'Neill to explain why she is refusing to support these important projects—projects that are important for our commuters, for our young people looking for work, for families looking to get ahead and for small businesses in my electorate.
