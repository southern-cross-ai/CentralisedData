       <p>
        This week my office was informed by the office of the Minister for Human Services, Senator Marise Payne, that our local Medicare office in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Kingsford Smith
        </a>
        , situated at the Eastgardens shopping centre, will no longer be open and making services available to the community on Saturdays. This is a great shame. The Medicare office in Eastgardens, which serviced my community, was well patronised on a Saturday. The largest demographic in our community is young families, and most of those families have both parents working five days a week, so, if they are to avail themselves of important health services at the local Medicare office, they need access to a service on the weekends. Our local Medicare office was providing that service. Now that will be taken away from our community. This is a great shame and something that is opposed by working families in my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It comes on the back of the consideration by this government of the possibility of a $6 Medicare co-payment, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        tax, as some have described it. In my community, 85 per cent of visits to the GP are bulk-billed. If this $6 co-payment is introduced by the Abbott government, it will mean that constituents in the seat of Kingsford Smith, in our community, will pay an additional $5.6 million to visit their local GP. That is something that those on fixed incomes, the elderly and those on invalid pensions cannot afford to pay for a visit to the local doctor, in a system which is supposed to provide universal health care for all Australians. The elderly person with a crook back or a dodgy knee who relies on regular visits to their GP, the young girl with a mental illness who relies on a regular visit to the GP for prescription medicationâ€”these are the people who will be hit by an additional payment of $6 if it is adopted by the Abbott government.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 2013 election, the No. 1 issue in our community was cuts to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Prince of Wales Hospital
        </a>
        by the Liberal state government and access to good-quality healthcare services. People throughout Australia and in my community want better health services. Unfortunately, this Abbott government is cutting health services by introducing a possible GP tax and closing our local Medicare office on Saturdays.
