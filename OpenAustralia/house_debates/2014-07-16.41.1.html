       <p>
        I rise to provide the House with an update on the Commonwealth's $110 investment in the proposed Palmerston Regional Hospital. Palmerston, as many of you know, is in my electorate. The tender for the intersection design on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Stuart Highway
        </a>
        was awarded last month and construction work is expected to commence in October. Discussions at the moment are focused on avoiding the need to lower major water mains. A geotechnical study on the proposed site is underway and a report is expected in September.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can advise that the preliminary draft of the concept master plan for the site has been received by the Northern Territory Department of Health and it is currently reviewing it. I am further advised that the department's preference is not to build a tower like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Darwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Darwin Hospital
        </a>
        but rather to have a facility that is several storeys high. The procurement process is being worked through by the Northern Territory Department of Health. The new hospital, as I have said in this place before, will be a valuable community asset once it is completed and will provide health services not only to Palmerston but also to Darwin's northern suburbs.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is quite clear, despite the lies that are being peddled by the Labor Party, that work is well and truly underway for the development of the Northern Territory's new Palmerston hospital, a hospital that will deliver services for the next 50 years for Darwin and Palmerston residents.
