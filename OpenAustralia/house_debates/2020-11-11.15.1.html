        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is one of the top 10 agricultural exporting countries in the world, exporting around two-thirds of our agricultural production each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strengthening the competitiveness and productivity of Australia's agriculture sector is a key commitment of this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want our agricultural industries to be able to capitalise on the opportunities that flow from growth in our region and globally, and we want to support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         National Farmers Federation
        </a>
        goal to grow Australian agriculture to $100 billion by 2030.
       </p>
       <p>
        To help us achieve this, we need to ensure we have appropriate regulatory settings to enable exports to grow and in turn to help drive productivity and increase returns at the farm gate.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will build upon the reforms introduced by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Control_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Export Control Act
        </a>
        2020 (the act) that streamline and consolidate existing export controls and commence on 28 March 2021.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill provides for several minor amendments to the Export Control Act to ensure a smooth transition and implementation of the new export control framework for exporters. These amendments will enable appropriate rules to be made to support the act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will clarify the application of the fit and proper person test to alterations or variations requested by occupiers of registered establishments, and enable the rules to prescribe circumstances where the secretary may approve or refuse to approve a notice of intention to export a consignment of prescribed goods.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will provide the secretary with the power to prescribe requirements in the rules for deciding whether to issue an export permit.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will enable the rules to modify how certain provisions apply to reviewable decisions for tariff rate quotas. It will enable the rules to apply matters contained in instruments to assist in calculating tariff rate quotas.
       </p>
       <p>
        While these amendments may appear to be relatively minor in nature, they will enable the government to ensure the necessary regulatory settings are in place to support Australian farmers to gain and maintain reliable access to overseas markets. This means increased profitability and certainty to enable further investment in their properties and people.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the Australian economy, it means more jobs, more exports and higher incomes in a competitive and profitable agricultural sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        For Australians, it means stronger regional communities and a more prosperous and productive Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill is just one of the initiatives that the government is progressing to modernise the systems that underpin our very valuable agricultural exports. This is a crucial step that supports the Australian agricultural sector as it continues to grow and respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
