        One of the great strides made in our community over the past few years has been in the growing involvement of women and girls in sport.

        has recently partnered with Bethania Rams in my electorate to run a free six-week program for women and girls within culturally and linguistically diverse communities. This program is designed to eliminate the unique barriers that members of culturally and linguistically diverse communities can experience when participating in football. From my years of playing sport, I know how valuable the membership of a sporting team can be for both physical and emotional wellbeing, and taking part in team sports can create bonds that last for many years.

        It is fantastic to see women's sporting teams sprouting at a grassroots level across my electorate of Forde and, more importantly, across the country. Unfortunately, research from Sport Australia shows that although girls and women are as active as boys and men almost half between the ages of 15 and 17 stop playing club sport at that age. This is a very disappointing statistic. I actively support our women's sporting teams across my electorate and regularly attend the terrific games of women's rugby league,

        and football. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to some of the clubs in my electorate who host women's teams.

        have a team in the Women's National Premier League and made the grand final last year but, sadly, were not successful. Ormeau Bulldogs and Beenleigh Buffaloes AFL clubs have both girls' and women's teams. Rugby league clubs Mustangs Brothers, Beenleigh Pride, Eagleby Giants and Ormeau Shearers all have girls' and women's teams, with the Ormeau Shearers women's team winning the 2020 SEQW Green premiership last year. These are all successful and thriving clubs. They are family and community based clubs run by generous and talented volunteers. It's fantastic to see our women and girls be part of these positive environments.

        A connection with sport gives far more than just physical fitness; it creates confidence, provides emotional support and broadens friendships. Suncorp's Australian Youth and Confidence Research shows that women who played team sport as children say it's helped them develop collaboration and teamwork skills, communication and social skills, flexibility and adaptability, confidence and resilience, the ability to give and receive feedback, and, importantly, leadership. As our young girls and women start out on the next season, 2021, I wish them all the best.
