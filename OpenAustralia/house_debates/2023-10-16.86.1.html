          I thank the member for Kennedy for his question and for his diligence in advancing the interests of his electorate. He has a longstanding concern about water security issues and opportunities in that region, and I visited with the member for Kennedy on a number of occasions and looked at the Hughenden irrigation scheme. I reckon I've been to Hughenden more than anyone in this chamber except for the member for Kennedy, and that is because it is such a critical area for our future economy.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a proposal that's been developed by

          o. The project would provide around 11,000 hectares of irrigated agricultural area; however, there are some steps that must be taken before it can be construction-ready. A sufficient water allocation must be obtained from the Queensland government, and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Infrastructure Australia
          </a>
          will need to assess the business case. The Queensland government wrote to us to consider funding for preconstruction activities, which I can tell the member for Kennedy we have now delivered. I will, of course, engage respectfully, as will the minister for infrastructure and, indeed, the minister for water, on this issue about the project and its associated infrastructure.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are spending some three-quarters of $1 billion on Queensland water infrastructure projects—
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Dam" rel="nofollow">
           Paradise Dam
          </a>
          , near Bundi, in Queensland; Cairns Water Security State 1 Project; the Mount Morgan Water Supply project, strategic planning for improving water security in Queensland; additional funding towards Big Rocks Weir in Queensland and groundwater improvement and water efficiency in the lower Burdekin, in Queensland. In total, we're investing over $2 billion in water infrastructure. We are investing in the sorts of projects that the member for Kennedy has advocated for over a long period of time, and we're certainly investing in Queensland.
         </p>
         <p>
          I look forward to continuing to work with the Palaszczuk government, including with my minister for infrastructure and minister for water, to make sure that we can make a difference—just as with the renewable energy projects I visited with the member for Kennedy, including, might I say, 'Big Kennedy' and 'Little Kennedy', which are not named after the member for Kennedy but are important projects nonetheless, as well as, of course, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidston_Dam" rel="nofollow">
           Kidston Dam
          </a>
          project and others as well. This is an important part of Australia that can certainly produce more. It produces a lot of wealth for this country, but there is an opportunity to expand further, and I look forward to working with the member for Kennedy to achieve that objective.
