        The cost of living is one of the things brought up with me the most in Bennelong. People are struggling not just with big-ticket items like the cost of housing and education but also with the day-to-day expenses we all face, like groceries, medical costs and, of course, electricity bills. That's why I was proud to sit here on Tuesday night as a member of a government that is stepping up to provide support and assistance on the cost of living to the people of Bennelong.
       </p>
       <p>
        About 1.6 million households in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        will receive a $500 rebate on their electricity bills. Because we on this side of the House know the cheapest form of energy is renewable energy, we're also helping families in Bennelong invest in electrifying their homes. There has been $1.3 billion made available to establish the Household Energy Upgrades Fund. This will help households fund energy upgrades such as solar, batteries and heat pumps, which will lower bills. Importantly, small business will not be left out of Bennelong's electrification. Not only will we reduce electricity bills for eligible small businesses by $650; we also have an incentive for small businesses to invest in the electrification of their businessâ€”an additional 20 per cent deduction on spending that supports electrification and the more efficient use of energy. A more sustainable and renewable energy future will bring down the cost of bills, and that's what this government is all about.
