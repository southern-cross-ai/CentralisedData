       <p>
        Today I want to acknowledge the passing of my friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Neil Thompson
        </a>
        . Neil, sadly, passed away after a strong fight against cancer at the young age of 45.
       </p>
       <p>
        His passion and dedication to restoring our old Fords is second to none. I first met Neil back in the mid-1990s and watched him build his business into Australia's premier
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GT" rel="nofollow">
         GT
        </a>
        performance restoration business. To those who are involved with Fords and GTs, Neil's name is synonymous with GT Falcons. Whenever I had the opportunity to visit his shop, GT Ford Performance, Neil always took the time to show me around and let me see what rare and special machines he was working on or restoring. His advice was always well received and his knowledge on all things GT was astounding. Many of us owe a great deal to Neil for his passion, help and advice. He certainly drove the GT restoration industry to a new level and did a lot to make our cars what they are today. Whether in the shop or on his program,

        , Neil always wanted to help people learn more about their cars.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sorry I will not be able to join the many hundreds of people at Neil's service today, but I want his family to know just how much he will be missed. To his sons, Jordie and Jake: thanks for sharing your dad with us. I know how painful it is to lose your dad, but I can tell you he was exceptionally proud of both of you, and I hope you always remember your dad was a wonderful man and will be proud of him. Goodbye, Neil, and rest in peace.
