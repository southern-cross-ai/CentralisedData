        Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, congratulations on reaching your position. I'd like to congratulate Jenny and Steve McGregor, who recently reached the milestone of 10 years of volunteering at Riding for the Disabled in Kendall. The committee and volunteers recently held a morning tea and presented a certificate to Jenny and Steve for their outstanding service and dedication to Riding for the Disabled in Kendall.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also doing great stuff are Halle Ford from Black Head Longboarders and Steve Keevers from Saltwater Malibu Club, who, along with club members, raised $500 at their surfing competition to benefit Samaritans Taree Women's Refuge. These surfers continue to ride a wave of charity and goodwill, with further community projects scheduled in the coming months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another great innovation I should celebrate is that Julie Fitzgerald, the president of Dungog's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and her team have established an art gallery in their hall. Paintings donated by community members have raised over $9,000 to pay for renovations for the wonderful old CWA hall in Dungog, and the fundraising is ongoing. Well done, Julie, on your terrific efforts.
       </p>

        The

        of Hallidays Point recently, at their changeover dinner, gave a huge wave of thanks and congratulations to outgoing president
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughn_Parker" rel="nofollow">

        , for his stewardship. Donations made during 2021-22 amounted to $127,000, an outstanding effort from Vaughn and the committee. Most of these funds were made through the op shop, and it's very professionally managed and presented by Lions Club volunteers.
