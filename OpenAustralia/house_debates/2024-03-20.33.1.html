        I was wrapped to visit the brand new Jilbup Primary School in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Hammond Park
        </a>
        which opened this year. It's named for the Noongar word for grasslands which, in turn, is related to Djilba, one of the six Noongar seasons. It was a privilege to be welcomed by Principal Louise O'Donovan and to be greeted by the year 6 student leaders, Eva, Gussie and Erin, who showed me around with obvious pride.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jilbup Primary is located in the south-east corner of my electorate, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Cockburn" rel="nofollow">
         City of Cockburn
        </a>
        . It's not only one of the fastest growing communities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , but one of the fastest growing communities in Australia as a whole. It's no wonder, because it is such a beautiful place, situated between the wetlands and the waves, with strong local character, great local government facilities and excellent services in terms of health and education. That includes the

        Super Clinic at

        , created under the previous federal Labor government, and the fantastic new Medicare Urgent Care Clinic in Beeliar that was opened by the Prime Minister last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jilbup Primary is, of course, a fresh instalment of high quality public school education infrastructure, thanks to the Cook Labor government. It will benefit hugely from the brilliant shared effort between state and federal Labor governments, with $770 million from the Albanese government to make WA the first jurisdiction to reach 100 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard. Kids right around Australia should be able to expect excellence in public education, and the Albanese Labor government is delivering that.
