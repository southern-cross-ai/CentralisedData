       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Customs Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2024 will modernise, streamline and strengthen the calculation of depot licence charges in support of the Customs Amendment (Strengthening and Modernising Licensing and Other Measures) Bill 2024.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alongside the primary changes to the Customs Act 1901, this bill will amend the Customs Licensing Charges Act 1997 to align the calculation of depot licence charges with that of warehouse licence charges.
       </p>
       <p>
        Streamlining licence fee processes and aligning payment requirements between customs licence types will support businesses to be better equipped in complying with their obligations under customs legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The alignment will enhance licence compliance by closing a loophole that has allowed licence holders not to pay their first renewal fee charge if the new depot licence was first granted between 1 April and 30 June in any given year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will amend the Charges Act to:
       </p>
       <p>
        a. set the default annual cost of a licence at $4,000 where the licence comes into force on 1 July;
       </p>
       <p>
        b. provide a formula based on a per diem value where the licence comes into force on a day in a financial year other than 1 July; and
       </p>
       <p>
        c. set out the criteria where the renewal charge for a depot licence is by default $4,000 and only where the depot is licensed for a full period of 12 months and handles fewer than 300 transactions is the charge $1,500.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments will support a level playing field for businesses by setting rules to ensure licence holders are not financially disadvantaged by the date on which their licence is granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together with the Customs Amendment (Strengthening and Modernising Licensing and Other Measures) Bill, this bill will modernise and strengthen the customs licensing regime, and has been consulted on widely with industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
