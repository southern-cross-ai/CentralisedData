        </a>
        and to indicate that the opposition will be supporting these changes. We are quite content to accept the government’s assurances that these are well-intentioned amendments. They will better clarify the eligibility status of partnerships for assistance under the Tradex Scheme Act and they will also remove some redundant provisions from the act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tradex Scheme was introduced in 2000 as a key initiative in the Howard government’s industry statement of the time. It has effectively served its purpose since then in streamlining the way in which relief is provided for businesses paying customs duty and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        on imported products that are ultimately intended for re-export, or for incorporation into other exported goods.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition will not be opposing the amendments contained in this bill on the understanding that their effect will be to make minor adjustments to improve the administration of the Tradex Scheme. We also trust that the government’s intention is to continue to provide good stewardship of a scheme which has for a decade provided genuine and important benefits to Australian industry and enhanced our international competitiveness as a trading nation.

        <p>
         I thank the opposition and the parliament for its support of this bill. This is an important amendment which looks at a number of key features of our international competitiveness, which are very important. It is right to say that the legislation was first introduced in 2000 as a program to relieve business specifically from paying customs duty and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         on imported products where those products are then further used and re-sold on as export products themselves. It makes perfect sense to make those adjustments and ensure that Australia remains competitive as a trading nation, and that our customs duty and GST are reflected adequately in the regulations that we have.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4445" rel="nofollow">
          Tradex Scheme Amendment Bill 2010
         </a>
         clarifies the eligibility of particular partnerships for the Tradex Scheme and it removes a number of redundant provisions. It specifically outlines the goods that may be imported and subjected to a process of treatment and then their re-exportation—and how that actually works—and whether they are incorporated in those goods, and the time period. It specifies the process that takes place, and that it must happen within a period of 12 months, for the people importing those goods and accessing the relief that this scheme provides. The current scheme provides about $200 million worth of upfront duty and GST relief to industry—a significant amount on importing and exporting.
        </p>
        <p>
         What the Tradex Scheme does is make sure that organisations in this country not only remain innovative but also remain competitive. That is something that this government has always had as a priority for its policy development.
        </p>
        <p>
         I take note too of comments from the member for Indi and her support for the bill. I say to her and to the opposition that the bill, as it reads, is quite simple and the amendments are straightforward. There are no complexities or unintended consequences. It is really just about removing any confusing parts particularly in terms of how it reads for partnerships in relation to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. It specifically provides that it include a body politic or a corporate as well as an individual.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, while a partnership is a relationship recognised by law, it is also an unincorporated body. Therefore coverage of partnerships under the Tradex Scheme could be considered unclear. While partnerships are not explicitly referred to in the Tradex Scheme in the legislation, they were not and are not intended to be excluded from the scheme itself. The bill clarifies that position and makes clear if there was any confusion in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also the redundant provision being removed by this bill relates to the transitional arrangements that you would expect in transferring the proceedings from the former scheme, the Texco Scheme, to the Tradex Scheme, which it superseded in 2000 when the new scheme was brought into play by the previous government. These are completely consistent with this government’s approach since 2007 to remove the regulatory burden on business, including small business, and we ought to continue doing that not only as a government but as a parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         This bill is being reintroduced. It was introduced earlier this year but due to the House being prorogued for the election it needed to be reintroduced. It is a good bill and is supported by everyone and I commend it to the House.

          I thank those members who have contributed to the debate on the

           Tradex Scheme Amendment Bill 2010

          . I am speaking in my capacity as representing the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research.
         </p>
         <p>
          As expected, this is a non-contentious bill seeking to clarify the eligibility of partnerships for the Tradex Scheme and also to remove redundant provisions. I want to thank the member for Oxley for his contribution. The Tradex Scheme was previously introduced as a streamlined program for providing relief to businesses paying customs duty and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
           GST
          </a>
          on imported products that are to be exported or incorporated into other goods that are to be exported. While partnerships were not explicitly referenced in the Tradex Scheme legislation, they were not and are not intended to be excluded in the scheme. This bill seeks to clarify this position in law.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill’s other minor amendments remove redundant parts of the act consistent with the government’s objective of reducing the regulatory burden. The Tradex Scheme will continue to provide real benefits to Australian industry and improve our international competitiveness as a trading nation.
         </p>
         <p>
          I commend the bill to the House.
