        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present the 84th annual report and Report No. 2 of 2021, concerning referrals made in November and December 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”The 84th annual report of the committee reflects on the work conducted by the Public Works Committee in 2020. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the committee's work, it was another busy year. Having moved to conducting most of its business via teleconference, during the time the committee inquired into 13 projects with a combined estimated value of more than $2.28 billion, tabled six reports and one annual report, examined 120 medium works proposals with a combined value of more than $807 million and held 32 meetings by teleconference or in person, depending on COVID-19 restrictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognising that the work of the committee could impact on construction activities around Australia, down to the level of subcontractors in small towns, the committee made a decision to prioritise its work and work with proponent entities to schedule hearings and complete its scrutiny and finalise reports as efficiently as possible. The committee would like to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance
        </a>
        who were able to ensure that the important work of the committee could continue via a provision in the act which enables the Governor-General to refer a public work to the committee. The committee also appreciates the cooperation of all entities in their flexibility and understanding in 2020, as this greatly assisted the committee in continuing to conduct its work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Report No. 2 of 2021 considers three proposals: one referred to the committee in November 2020 and two referred in December 2020. The total value of the proposed works for the three projects is $79.22 million, with the projects being undertaken in Perth, Brisbane and Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first chapter of the report contains the report of the inquiry into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        's proposed Perth precinct project with an estimated cost of $18.7 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The CSIRO sought approval from the committee to refurbish its Kensington and Waterford sites to accommodate the arrival of staff from its underutilised site in Floreat. The project is the first step towards consolidation, with further efficiencies to be delivered by future projects, guided by the CSIRO Perth master plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second chapter of report No. 2 contains the report of an inquiry into Airservices Australia's proposed Brisbane Air Traffic Services Centre and Control Tower Complex refurbishment, with an estimated cost of $35.7 million, excluding GST. The project will provide space to accommodate the relocation and integration of the Defence air traffic control approach services from Darwin and Townsville Air Force bases into the Brisbane complex.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final chapter of report No. 2 contains the report of the inquiry into Airservices Australia's proposed Sydney airport tower refurbishment, with an estimated cost of $24.8 million, excluding GST. The project will allow for current generation technology to be upgraded to new integrated tower automation suite technology and address a number of mechanical, structural and safety shortcomings. The tower will remain fully operational throughout the works, and the heritage value of the tower will be maintained.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd just like to take the opportunity to thank all the committee members for their work during 2020, and particularly the former chair, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVeigh" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who, as we all know, retired from this place in September last year. I'd also like to thank the committee secretariat for their work, particularly the committee secretary, Pauline Cullen; inquiry secretary, Klara Fay; Tanya Pratt, the office manager; and all others who contributed to the work of the committee throughout 2020. Thank you very much.
