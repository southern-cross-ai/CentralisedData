        manages the program for Greening Australia and has had up to six teams of young Territorians working at any one time. The teams work on practical environmental projects for six months, during which time they also undertake accredited training and gain qualifications. Many agencies and community groups have been involved in all the projects.

        Last week I launched the latest project at
