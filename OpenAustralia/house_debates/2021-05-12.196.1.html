        After watching the Treasurer deliver the budget last night, I cannot help but think this government has perfected the art of announcements—announcing policies and infrastructure projects but announcing very little on delivery. Last night we heard once again that the North-South Corridor infrastructure project in Adelaide was going to be funded and completed. We have heard this over and over again. This was a promise from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">

        in the lead-up to the 2013 election. It was announced by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
         Joe Hockey

        in the 2014 budget. It was announced in the 2015 budget, the 2016 budget, the 2017 budget, the 2018 budget, the 2019 budget, the 2020 budget and now in the 2021 budget. We've had the same announcement eight times, yet the Torrens to

        section of the project, which is in the electorate of Adelaide, is yet to start. This is a project that this government has announced over and over again. In fact on radio this morning the Liberal Treasurer of

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Lucas" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —I was on air with him—said there is nothing new in this; this has been announced over and over and it is only $1 billion per year for all infrastructure projects in South Australia. This project's cost is $8.9 billion. This is pie in the sky, a furphy, another reannouncement. The government has perfected the art of announcements, the art of marketing and the art of sales.

         This week's federal budget is another major boost for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Sunshine Coast
         </a>
         infrastructure with $172 million worth of new projects funded by the Morrison government, which will help secure our region's recovery. The Morrison government is investing $160 million to transform the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooloolah_River" rel="nofollow">
          Mooloolah River

         interchange. The Queensland Labor government can't do it on their own because they are absolutely hopeless. Anyone who travels to or from Mooloolaba on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicklin_Way" rel="nofollow">

         or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
          Sunshine Motorway
         </a>
         would know that this section of road is an absolute deathtrap. This funding is going to get locals home sooner and safer, and boost the local economy with construction jobs now as well as provide a more attractive experience for tourists into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         The budget includes $7 million to extend Caloundra's Third Avenue to Nicklin Way, forming a real solution to the gridlock around the Nicklin Way-Caloundra Road roundabout. I listened carefully to the community's concerns about this project. However, I am now satisfied that, with this funding, we will preserve the character of the region while delivering a massive and long-awaited benefit for all Caloundra residents. This is another project that the Queensland Labor government couldn't or wouldn't fund without the federal government.
        </p>
        <p>
         The budget also includes $5 million for a study to pave the way for further duplication of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">

         rail line. This is another example of the Queensland Labor government being incapable of doing their own infrastructure projects.
