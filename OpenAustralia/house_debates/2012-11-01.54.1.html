       <p>
        I rise today to register my condolences for Belmont City Councillor and close friend, Glenys Godfrey, on the death of her husband, Ron Godfrey. Well known for his cheeky sense of humour, Ron was loved by the local community. As a bloke's bloke, Ron prided himself on being a cheery local larrikin with a heart of gold. Ron grew up in Kalgoorlie, one of Western Australia's iconic mining towns. Ron and Glenys have lived in Redcliffe in my electorate of Swan for over 20 years and have been well known as passionate and active members of the local community. Ron loved horse racing—that is where he and Glenys met—and was a member of the Victoria Park Bowls Club. Ron was a dedicated family man. He was a husband, father, step-father, grandfather and great-grandfather. His passions kept him busy but he was always hugely supportive of Glenys.

        During his funeral ceremony, the mention of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Eagles" rel="nofollow">
         West Coast Eagles
        </a>
        came up. Ron was a strong supporter of the West Coast Eagles. They say that behind every good man is a good woman. Well, Ron was the good man behind the good woman Glenys. His daughter was amazed that she eventually was able to get Ron to wear an apron while he was cooking—so good on you, Glenys. Ron was also famous for loving a schooner and a beer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite his long struggle with illness, Ron stayed resilient throughout. With his sense of humour and love for his family, Ron kept up his strength until his last moments. Ron passed away peacefully on 13 October 2012. Ron will be dearly missed, but not forgotten, by all who knew him.
