        Today I pay tribute to one of nature's true gentleman, a local statesman and all-round good bloke, Mr Hugh Mitchell Clarke, more broadly known as Mitch. Mitch departed from us on 13 October 2022 at the age of 92, leaving behind a legacy of commitment and service to community. He now rests with his beloved wife, Edna. Mitch was a proud father of two sons, Allan and Glenn, and then later in life he was a proud grandfather of his six grandchildren. Mitch was a canegrower in

        with his father. They farmed the land together from 1950, and he enjoyed a rich life with his wife, raising their children there. Later on in life he handed the farm on to his sons.
       </p>
       <p>
        I knew of Mitch a long time before I knew him personally, such was his presence and highly esteemed reputation in our community. He served on the executive of the Proserpine District Canegrowers for 21 years. He brought a great deal of passion and understanding to his role. He served on the hospital board for almost two decades and he helped found the Whitsunday Sailing Club. He was a proud National Party member for over 25 years. One of his greatest passions was Rotary, which he served for more than 55 years. He was a member of the Masonic lodge for over 65 years. He was a man of the land and he loved the sea. He loved his farm and he loved where he lived. He loved the Whitsundays. He loved his family.
       </p>

        Vale Hugh Mitchell Clarke. Thank you for your sacrifice and unwavering dedication and service to the community of Dawson. A life well lived and a presence dearly missed. Rest in peace, you great man.
