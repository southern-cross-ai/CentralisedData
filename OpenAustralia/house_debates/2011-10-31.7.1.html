       Australian Dairy Industry

      <p class="italic">
       To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       In May 2010 the Senate Economics References Committee released the report from their inquiry into milk pricing entitled Milking it for all it's worth—competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Senate Committee formed the view that the retail and processor levels are now dominated by two supermarket chains, Coles and Woolworths, and a handful of (now mostly foreign owned) processors, placing the farmers at a competitive disadvantage. It took the view that the major supermarkets appear to be using their dominant market positions (having captured 80% of the grocery market) to drive down the farmgate price through the sale of generic products that puts pressure on processors who are forced to compete with their own products.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       We note that at times this is leading to severe hardship amongst dairy farmers, accelerating the process of forcing some to have to leave their farms.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Your petitioners therefore ask the House to:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Act on the recommendations of the Senate Economics References Committee report Milking it for all it's worth—competition and pricing in the Australian dairy industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       from 439 citizens
