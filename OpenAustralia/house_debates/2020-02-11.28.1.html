       <p>
        Tragically, over the first weekend of February four children were killed in Sydney in a horrific road accident. They were struck by an alleged drunk driver while on their way to get ice cream. It is every parent's worst nightmare. As a mother of four and also the ambassador for the Little Blue Dinosaur Foundation, this issue hits close to home. I have spoken previously in this place about the work of Little Blue Dinosaur. They work tirelessly to educate children and parents about road safety. This horrific event shows us just how dangerous our roads are for children.

        One of the children killed was the vibrant Veronique Sakr, aged 11, who attended

         Santa Sabina

        College in Strathfield. She was killed along with her three cousins. As a former Santa Sabina student, I know how incredibly tight-knit the school community is and I know that the loss of one of its students has been devastating. The families affected by this horrific accident belonged to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maronite_Catholic" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Church and are leaning on their faith at this difficult time. They have asked the community to remember to smile in Veronique's memory.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reid has an incredibly strong Maronite Catholic community, and I have seen their outpouring of support and prayer in the last few days. I know that our entire community has been shaken and grieves alongside the families impacted, but we are also here to provide support and solace.
