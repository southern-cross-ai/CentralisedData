        It gives me great pleasure in this penultimate sitting to talk about the local City Heart Taskforce that I put together on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        as my response to the coronavirus pandemic. The City Heart Taskforce is made up of leaders—the lions of industry on the Gold Coast. There are 14 key pillars across the City Heart Taskforce, which I brought together to make sure that we have a cross-industry think tank on the Gold Coast to steward the way forward for jobs, skills and industry. I have updated the House previously on the 2020 Reimagine Gold Coast forum, which I held at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre in August last year, and the following Reimagine 2.0 forum that I held at

       <p>
        I want to take the opportunity to thank the City Heart Taskforce executive members for their input and dedication to our city over the last 19 or so months. I'll start with Regional Development Australia. Estella Rodighiero has done so much work in the area of manufacturing. Manufacturing is worth about $7 billion to the Gold Coast and 14½ thousand direct jobs, so it's a very important area. Estella has done great work with Industry 4.0 and the emerging technology-led industries on the Gold Coast. There are also the two local chambers of commerce that span Moncrieff. They have two fantastic presidents,

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Martin Hall
        </a>
        . I thank them for their input and feedback on the JobKeeper 1 and JobKeeper 2 wage subsidies that helped so many—32,000—businesses across Moncrieff, 10½ thousand of whom were on JobKeeper for some period.
