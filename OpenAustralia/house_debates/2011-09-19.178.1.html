        Recently I had the pleasure of presenting an Australian flag to past and present students of

        in Launceston. They are now in Malaysia representing Australia at the

        The F1 in Schools program is a science, technology, engineering and maths based education competition implemented in high schools around the world. Through the appeal of Formula One racing, the program gives challenges in engineering and design while stimulating an interest in engineering related careers and connecting young people to the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 35,000 Australian students take part each year. This year a team made up of current and former students of Brooks High School in my electorate of Bass have continued Australia's tradition of achievement in the program. The team, known as the 'PentaGliders', will compete in the world finals in design, analysis, testing, manufacturing and racing of

        powered balsawood Formula One cars. It was fantastic to meet the team marketing manager, Amy Winter, the design and aerodynamic engineer, Tristan McCarthy, and to hear about the benefits and achievements of the F1 in Schools program. The students have been enjoying the chance for hands-on learning while improving their public speaking skills, team presentation and awareness of modern engineering technologies.

        The PentaGliders recently competed at the national titles in Sydney. They won the Australian Grand Prix Corporation fastest car award, the best energy efficient design, and became the first Tasmanian team to win the national titles and progress through to the world finals.

        are today in Malaysia as the Australian representatives at the world championships. For those interested, the event will be broadcast today at 4 pm on the F1 in Schools website.
       </p>
       <p>
        The F1 in Schools program has allowed the PentaGliders to develop close relationships with sponsors and local industry and business. Sponsors are recognised through local media events, on cars, posters and videos and on the team's uniform. Local industry is also closely involved with the PentaGliders. Businesses such as

        have been providing assistance to the team.
       </p>
       <p>
        The PentaGliders are a fantastic example of the way the F1 in Schools program engages and inspires young people. I am proud that through the

        the federal government supports this program through sponsorship of the program manager, the Re-Engineering Australia Foundation. I take this opportunity to congratulate the team on their achievements so far and wish them well in the event today.
