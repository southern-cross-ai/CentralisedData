        I'd like to acknowledge Donna Layton, who is the manager of the Notaras sawmill in Grafton. She's been working at the mill for 43 years and is one of few female sawmillers in the country. Donna lost her property to the 2019-20 bushfires. These bushfires also devastated the timber industry, causing a more than 40 per cent downturn and a major shortage of timber supply. Donna worked tirelessly to find a way to keep the business open and continue to pay people's wages. Because of her efforts, Donna was awarded the 2021 Shine Award in the dedication category. The Shine Awards aim to recognise regional and rural women who make a real difference to their communities. Donna, the dedication you have to the business is incredible, and I thank you for that. I know that Spiro is looking down on you and is very proud, as is the whole Notaras family.

         Michelle Ryan

        , who has recently had her German-Australian Opera Grant extended for the 2021-22 season. Michelle grew up on a sugarcane farm at Harwood and went to school at Maclean. She wanted to be a pop singer, but after being introduced to opera by her singing teacher she fell in love with the art. Michelle was the recipient of the German-Australian Opera Grant in 2020 and was to fly to Germany in June; however, her plans were placed on hold for a number of months due to the pandemic. Michelle eventually flew over in August 2020 and has been there ever since. She is playing Gretel in

        I'd like to acknowledge Dr James Hodges from Grafton. James was recently highly commended in the 2020-21 Michelle Beets Award for Inspirational Paediatric Care. This award recognises the commitment and achievements of people who go above and beyond and inspire others to deliver the best possible care for children. James is a staff specialist paediatrician at the Grafton Base Hospital. He is also on the project team for
        <i>
         The first 2000 days framework
        </i>
        , which outlines the importance of the first 2,000 days of a child's life. During the pandemic, James identified the need for carers in out-of-home care to be prioritised for vaccination and advocated heavily for this. He also advocates mental health and counselling services for children in the

        and has a strong focus on early intervention. Rosemaria Flaherty from Northern New South Wales Local Health District said that James has built trusting relationships also within Aboriginal communities and families in our region. He is highly regarded within the Yaegl carer community, and the kids are lucky to have him. Congratulations, James, on your nomination. I know that Linda and your children, Georgia and Nicholas, are very proud of you.
