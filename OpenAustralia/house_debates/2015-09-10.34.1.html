        This week is a great week for

        because, on the

        ladder, the Dockers are first and the

         West Coast Eagles
        </a>
        are second. It is going to be a great weekend in which we celebrate our national sport. I want to acknowledge my rival club, which is Julie Bishop's club, the Eagles. Let us hope that the players for the final eight teams, who have put in all the energy and effort to make sure their teams get there, enjoy the moment. But what is more important is the way in which they win. I know that, for our economy, having the two preliminary finals in Western Australia this weekend will be fantastic, and I intend to go to both games. I felt saddened for

        , who was up in the gallery wearing a

        scarf, because, as I said to him, 'The Dockers will clean you up.' But all the best to all the players, and I am looking forward to the grand final being between the Dockers and the West Coast Eagles, because they have worked hard for it. I want to acknowledge the young players who have come through the season for all the clubs. Their heart, compassion and commitment have taken their teams to the levels that they are at. I was sitting with

        last night, and we were talking about football and the fun and enjoyment that we all get out of it. I look forward to a fantastic weekend and I feel sorry for those who will lose against the Eagles and the Dockers!
