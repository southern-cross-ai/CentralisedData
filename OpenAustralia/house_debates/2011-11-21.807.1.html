        I rise in this place for the third time to acknowledge the massacre of Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians from 1915 to 1923 and in recognition of these atrocities as genocides. As nearly all of those who witnessed these massacres have since passed on, it is essential to their memories that their stories are recounted once more. It is also essential to the healing of the generations that have followed that their ancestors' suffering is recognised.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1948 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        proclaimed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Prevention_and_Punishment_of_the_Crime_of_Genocide" rel="nofollow">
         Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
        </a>
        , which defined genocide as 'any of a number of acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group'. From the eyewitness accounts of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
         ANZAC
        </a>
        soldiers and survivors there is little doubt that the massacre of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians, one million Greeks and 750,000 Assyrians fits this definition. In fact, when international jurist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Lemkin" rel="nofollow">
         Raphael Lemkin
        </a>
        coined the term 'genocide', he specifically based it on the experiences of the Armenians at the hands of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" rel="nofollow">
         Ottoman Empire
        </a>
        , which governed the region for over 620 years. It is an irony of history that the atrocities committed against the Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians were the last acts of this once great empire.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should also be recognised that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Turkey" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Turkey
        </a>
        that grew from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire is not the same nation that committed these atrocities but a nation with which Western countries now enjoy strong diplomatic relations and healthy trade, commerce and tourism. The modern Republic of Turkey has often been lauded as a successful model for a democratic, secular Islamic state. However, the refusal to recognise the horrific actions of the empire that preceded them does serve to irritate wounds that have not yet healed.
       </p>
       <p>
        This morning I was fortunate to meet with young representatives of the Armenian National Committee of Australia, the Australian Hellenic Council and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_Universal_Alliance" rel="nofollow">
         Assyrian Universal Alliance
        </a>
        . It is clear that these young folk look forward to the day when a bridge can be built to move past these ancient conflicts. We have seen repeatedly through international history that the first step down this long road is the acknowledgment of past wrongs. This step not only helps to honour the dead but also helps to ensure that the passage of time is not used to deny or distort historical facts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the experiences endured by the Armenian, Assyrian and Greek communities, the world has witnessed the Holocaust and genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda and Darfur. Appropriate international recognition and condemnation of these atrocities is an important step towards preventing history from repeating itself once more. Australia may yet have a role to play, using our remote geographical position as a nation that thrives on the principles of multiculturalism and the contributions of our vibrant Armenian, Greek, Assyrian and Turkish local communities. Yet this must first be launched from the steps taken by this parliament, and I urge the government to follow in the footsteps of so many nations in formally recognising these genocides. The actions of members of this parliament will help to solidify the global movement to identify these atrocities for what they are, whilst acknowledging the important role played by community groups in our local regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Bennelong I am fortunate to represent the largest Armenian community of any electorate in Australia, and I take this opportunity to recognise the presence in the gallery today of Mr Hagop Der Khatchadourian, World Council Chairman of the Armenian National Committee; Mr Varant Meguerditchian,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Director
        </a>
        of the Armenian National Committee of Australia; and representatives of the Armenian National Committee Australia, the Australian Hellenic Council and the Assyrian Universal Alliance. I acknowledge the great work you all do in representing your communities and your important mission to maintain the memories of those who came before you. As the representative for the people of Bennelong, and as a coalition member of this parliament, I look forward to continuing on this journey with you for acknowledgement of this tragic time in your history and the building of bridges towards a brighter future.
