       <p>
        I stand to speak about an inspiring group that is working to save a palliative care hospice in Launceston. Friends of Philip Oakden House is receiving the community support that it deserves. Just yesterday I was fortunate enough to attend a memorial church service to honour that wonderful service that Philip Oakden House staff and volunteers have provided since 1993. I joined with hundreds of people to remember those who have died with dignity and love amidst some very difficult circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        The hospice is at risk of being closed as the operator,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneCare" rel="nofollow">
         OneCare
        </a>
        , wishes to withdraw. The hospice will close next month unless another operator is found. The Tasmanian government is to be thanked for recently doubling the funding available to the hospice. However, I would now urge it to be flexible and to actively assist a new operator to come on board. Like the 6,000 people who signed a petition to support Philip Oakden House, I am personally very disappointed at OneCareâ€™s decision to discontinue the service despite what appears to have been an adequate funding offer. There is a prevailing determination in the community to keep Philip Oakden House operating. Today I again call on all parties to do the right thing to continue the service. I wish to pay tribute to Barb Baker and Kim Pridham and their dedicated group in the Friends of Philip Oakden House for the magnificent way that they are handling this very difficult issue.
