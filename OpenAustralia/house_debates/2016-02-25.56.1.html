        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House how this government's increased investment in Australia's defence industries will bring benefits right across the economy? How will the government's plan help generate highly skilled jobs of the future, including the leading edge defence industries in my home state of

          I thank the honourable member for his question. I note his very keen interest in, and understanding of, the importance of the defence industries. He understands how critically important defence communities are to the social and economic fabric of Australia and, in particular, in his city of Adelaide.

          This white paper will deliver for all Australians, it will deliver for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          , it will deliver for defence communities and defence industry right across the country. It includes new shipbuilding programs, upgrades to bases and airfields, and new investment in innovation and technology right across the board in our defence sector. Our priority is to ensure that many more of our defence dollars are spent here in Australia. This increased commitment generates jobs, growth, innovation right across the Australian economy. And it is especially true of regional communities, where so many of our
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Defence Force
          </a>
          and defence industry contractors live and work. As defence grows, communities grow; businesses flourish and jobs are created. Critically, this defence white paper, because of the detailed preparation and work that has gone into it, because of the investment plan that it lays out, means that our defence industries will be able to invest and plan with greater certainty.
         </p>
         <p>
          My government's commitment to the continuous onshore build strategy for naval surface vessels fundamentally transforms our naval shipbuilding industry, ensuring its long-term sustainability. Our shipbuilding workforce will be building the Navy's frigates, offshore patrol vessels, and major and minor war vessels for decades to come. We will ensure that the Australian submarine industry involvement is sustainable over the longer term by building a new force of 12 regionally superior submarines. An island nation girt by sea, as our anthem says, must have a strong Navy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Other industries will be able to leverage off the advances in technology and innovation, skills and know-how flowing from a stronger defence sector. It is important to remember that some of the most significant technologies of the 20th and 21st centuries originated as military inventions. Famously,
