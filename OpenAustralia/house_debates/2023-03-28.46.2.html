        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . A single parent with two children loses over $100 a week in payments when their child turns eight and they are forced off the very modest parenting payment single and onto the even lower JobSeeker payment. What advice does the minister give single parents—mostly women, many of whom are survivors of family violence—who the government are forcing to make a choice between living in poverty or returning to violence? Will the government commit in the upcoming budget to restoring access to the parenting payment single for parents until their youngest child is 16?

         I would like to thank the member for her question and say that the Albanese government is very much committed to supporting single parents to help them manage work and family responsibilities. Of course, this includes a range of social security payments, paid parental leave and cheaper child care. This government knows that Australians are doing it tough, and we are always looking at ways that we can better support them. That's why we've made a number of commitments to help with the cost of living: cheaper child care, cutting the cost of the PBS co-payments and, of course, announcing the energy bill relief fund, which will deliver targeted and temporary relief on power bills to eligible households, including those on income support payments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Through the social security system, single parents can be eligible for parenting payment and, as the member rightly indicates, as their child gets older, most parents are able to increase their level of employment and reduce their need for income support. Of course, there are still those that do continue to rely on income support as their child gets older and do move to the JobSeeker payment and receive a higher rate is the principal carer to ensure they do get additional support. In addition, single parents also can get a range of extra supplements and supports.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say to the member that this government is always looking at how we can better support Australians, particularly those on low incomes, and the government has recently established the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee to provide advice on economic inclusion and tackling disadvantage ahead of every federal budget. Some of the payments that will be looked at include those being received by single parents such as parenting payment, JobSeeker payment and Commonwealth rent assistance.

          I don't understand why those opposite are

          , but I can tell you that this government will take those most vulnerable and their living situation seriously. We will consider it through the budget context, and I look forward to continuing to work with the member on how we best deliver to those most disadvantaged in Australia.
