       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge local residents from across the communities in my electorate of Hume who were recognised this week in the King's Birthday honours.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Kim Hill
        </a>
        was recognised for her service to the Buxton community. A member of the Buxton
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">
         RFS
        </a>
        , Kim has been volunteering for more than 30 years. Kim played a leading role during the Green Wattle Creek bushfires. She helped raise over $200,000 to build a memorial playground in honour of Buxton RFS volunteer firefighters Geoff Keaton and Andrew O'Dwyer, who fought and died, as we all remember, back in December 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lesley Johnson has been recognised for her contribution to the community of Gunning, giving almost 60 years of her life to volunteering with the church and various community groups in the town, including Gunning Mothers Club and the Gunning Show society, and as a volunteer driver for the local community health service.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_James" rel="nofollow">
         Carol James
        </a>
        of Goulburn has been recognised for her service to the community as a local councillor for more than 15 years but also being involved in so many other community groups across Goulburn. She somehow manages to balance them all alongside her local real estate businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to acknowledge the remarkable contributions of Heather Bieman of Camden in the field of music teaching and Valmai Stewart of Camden, who has tirelessly served the communities of both Camden and Dubbo. My heartfelt congratulations to these extraordinary individuals, who inspire us all to make our communities better places to live.
