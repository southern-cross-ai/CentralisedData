       <p>
        On Anzac Day this year we passed that moment when, exactly 100 years ago, our young Anzacs stepped off the boats under a breaking Gallipoli dawn. That moment—and the many terrible ones to follow—are woven into our national identity because of what they were to reveal: the acts of courage, sacrifice, mateship and heartbreak. On that morning in 1915 this young army of volunteer soldiers was committed to an impossible objective along those chalky cliffs and ridges. For the next eight months, that place would be their mission and their home. It was here that the 'digger' came into being. Of course, it was a tactical blunder that put them there—one totally beyond their control. The eight-month bloody stalemate that followed was to no military gain.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gallipoli campaign proved to be a prelude to the much larger tragedy of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        between 1914 and 1918, with a shocking loss of life and dreadful injuries. One hundred years on, across Australia, in our cities, suburbs and towns, people of all walks of life gathered in record numbers to remember them. Importantly, we saw the next generation of young people take ownership of our commemorations like never before.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Jagajaga, a series of milestone projects were supported under the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Progam, announced by Prime Minister Gillard in April 2012

        My local Electorate Committee has worked very hard to ensure that every resident has the chance to engage in our commemorations through to 2018. I thank all the members of the Electorate Committee including:

        A very special thanks must go to President Bill McKenna of the Montmorency-Eltham RSL. For two years, Bill has worked closely with each of our local RSLs, councils, local schools and my office. I would also like to particularly thank one of my electorate staff, Antony Kenney. Bill hosted planning meetings, knocked on doors and tied everything together. We got some tremendous projects delivered, including: a commemorative ceramic mosaic project depicting the human stories of Gallipoli, which will be at the

        Centenary Commemorative Service, led by local school students. It was held at Petrie Park, the home of the Montmorency-Eltham RSL. This event was supported by over 1200 students from six local schools, and I would like to thank them all:

        and also led their boys choir in the New Zealand National Anthem, and Sean sang the first verse of that anthem in Maori. Many commented on how powerful Sean's voice was for such a young man, and I know we will hear many more great things from him in the future. Eltham College also led the

        to cap off a very inspiring and stirring event.
       </p>
       <p>
        This very successful event—like the rest that will follow—will help to spread the message of peace: that war is never something to be glorified, but that we take this opportunity, and will continue to do so, to acknowledge the sacrifice made by so many. As a community, we must always work towards enhancing peace, understanding and tolerance. Importantly, these projects will help shed new light on our local ANZAC stories and where possible reveal new ones, because our community has its own fascinating stories to tell. We have a local historian and resident, Terry Phillips, a man who has done enormous amounts of local research and has records that indicate the last man off Gallipoli came from Greensborough. One of the most prominent works of art commemorating fallen soldiers from the First World War in the

Once again I would like to thank all of those involved for all the work they have done—especially our local RSLs and Bill McKenna in particular—to make this a very special time for all our local residents.

         landings at Gallipoli was commemorated in my electorate of Moore and in communities across the nation at ceremonies and local events. This significant event in our national history has contributed to our Australian national identity and the values which we hold dear, including devotion to duty, loyalty to one's mates, personal sacrifice and service to our country. At that time, Australia was a young nation, barely 15 years out of Federation, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">

         represented our first substantive entry onto the international stage. Patriotic Australians, keen to do their duty for king and country enlisted in the

          The First World War
         </a>
         unleashed the horror of modern warfare on an unprecedented scale. The period between 1870 and the early 1900s represented a significant era in the development of small arms and artillery. The technological development of modern nitro-cellulose based explosives, propellant and cartridges led to the design and development of automatic weapons with high sustained rates of fire, and artillery with explosive ordnance. These technological advances changed the ground rules of warfare: never before in history had such lethal and effective weapons been deployed on the battlefield, inflicting heavy casualties and loss of life. The Anzac troops were confronted with the sombre reality of entrenched machine gun positions and the appalling stalemate conditions of trench warfare. In these conditions of hardship and deprivation, the Anzac spirit was born out of our troops' support of each other.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the context of a world that is faced with conflict and security concerns, it is important that these Anzac values be maintained and passed down to future generations of young Australians so that we as a nation may meet and overcome the future security challenges that we face as a nation in uncertain times. Just as the Anzacs were confronted with modern weapons, today we are faced with new security threats and the difficulty in identifying our enemies in the war on terrorism. However, armed with the Anzac spirit, we will be able to overcome whatever those future challenges may be.
        </p>

         At a local level, I pay tribute to the community work of the local

Somerly Primary School held a morning service around the newly constructed Anzac memorial garden, and it was pleasing to see so many parents in attendance. I make mention of Principal Tracey Renton, who has been supportive of educating students about Anzac history. In the afternoon, the students and staff at Joseph Banks Secondary College held its memorial service outdoors, with many parents in attendance. I acknowledge Principal Eleanor Hughes, who commenced as foundation principal when the school opened earlier this year and has done a creditable job in establishing school events anew, such as the Anzac service. On Anzac Day the three local RSL branches held dawn services, which attracted record crowds in paying their respects. I was among a crowd of approximately 10,000 residents that attended the Wanneroo-Joondalup RSL service in

In 1917, they were part of the Desert Column which advanced into Palestine. The regiment participated in the bloody battles to break the Gaza-Beersheba line and helped capture Jerusalem. It participated in the Es Salt Raid in May of 1918. That August, it was one of the regiments re-equipped with swords and rifle boots and retrained to take a more orthodox cavalry role. In their new role, they took part in the rout of the Ottoman army in the

          I am proud to report to this House some of the activities which have taken place in the electorate of Indi to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the

          Anzac Day in north-east Victoria dawned cold and wet. Despite the wet start, the crowds were large in the early morning light at the Wodonga dawn service, at the Anzac morning service in Tangambalanga and then during my visit to the

          broadcast from the war memorial in Melbourne, we felt a strong sense of camaraderie. I am told that community participation in Anzac Day services has been growing steadily in the past decade across all of Indi, and it is clear from this that we value and honour the commemoration.

          Under the federal government's Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program, funding of up to $125,000 was available for each federal member of parliament to support projects in their electorate. I would like to acknowledge the work of the former MP for Indi, Ms Sophie Mirabella, in establishing the initial Indi committee to oversee the processes of community involvement in this program. Under Sophie's guidance a call went out to the various community groups across Indi for projects, and the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program Committee spent much time, energy and commitment considering all these projects. To the committee members, I would like to say thank you for your commitment, your valuable contribution and your insight and knowledge. I would like to name them for

So, to Maddison, Brad, Oliver and Sarah, and teacher Michelle: well done.
