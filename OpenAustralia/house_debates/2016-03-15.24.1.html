       <p>
        I take no pleasure in rising today to talk about Greens preferences in the upcoming federal election. It is an issue that I wish I did not have to spend time on, but Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Natale" rel="nofollow">
         Di Natale
        </a>
        's recent comments on this matter make it something that everyone in Australia who cares about progressive policy needs to pay attention to.

        are currently suggesting they will direct preferences to the Greens in seats like my own, in exchange for the Greens running an open ticket in marginal electorates. An arrangement like that would make it more likely that the Liberals will win marginal seats and, ultimately, form government. Senator Di Natale continues to refuse to rule out such an arrangement. Indeed, the Greens candidate in Chisholm, a marginal electorate in Victoria held by Labor by around one per cent, today confirmed that it was an option.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to Mr Di Natale and to all people who care about progressive policy outcomes in this country that politics is not a game. This kind of behaviour might seem like clever politics, but helping elect Liberal MPs in marginal seats and risking electing Liberal governments betrays the progressive cause.
       </p>

        Do the Greens prefer Labor's $30 billion investment in needs based school funding in their country, or do they prefer the Liberals' cuts to school funding? Do they prefer Labor's guaranteed uni funding over the Libs policy of deregulation and $100,000 degrees? Do they prefer a parliamentary vote on marriage equality or Malcolm Turnbull's plebiscite? Do they prefer Labor's policy of a price on carbon and a robust

        , or do they prefer the government's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Action" rel="nofollow">
         Direct Action
        </a>
        plan? If the Greens prefer Labor's policies on these issues, Senator Di Natale should immediately make it clear that he will recommend preferences for Labor in all seats in the coming federal electionâ€”
