        The parliamentary amendment removes a mechanism to remove reporting obligations for businesses that provide courier or cleaning services where those services are merely a small part of the overall activity of the business. Following the introduction of the bill to parliament on 7 February 2018, additional stakeholder consultation was undertaken to address concerns that businesses providing a small portion of courier or cleaning services may have a disproportionate compliance burden. Stakeholders were supportive of the introduction of a threshold test based on GST turnover to exempt certain businesses from the reporting requirements. The threshold test will create an exemption for those businesses that receive payments for courier or cleaning services totalling less than 10 per cent of the business's overall GST turnover. If a business satisfies this test, they will be exempt from reporting the payments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        that they make to contractors they engage to complete these services.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Commissioner of Taxation may, through legislative instrument, amend or alter the threshold test in response to a change in risks and compliance burden identified in the courier and cleaning industries. Given that legislative instruments are disallowable by either house of parliament, any proposed change to the threshold test by the commissioner will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The introduction of the threshold test will not have a material impact on the costings as published in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. The ATO will publish guidance material on its website to assist businesses providing cleaning or courier services to determine when they need to report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government announced a further expansion to the taxable payments reporting system in the 2018-19 budget to the following new industries: security providers and investigation services, road freight transport services, and computer systems design and related services. Application of the threshold test for these new industries will be considered during the development of the legislation for the measure.
