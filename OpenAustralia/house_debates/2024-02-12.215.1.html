        The community spirit of the Upper Yarra Valley was on full display last weekend. It began with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Long" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        memorial match between Powelltown and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Junction" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at Yarra Junction. It was very enjoyable to dust off the whites and join the Powelltown side for the match in memory of a great local manâ€”a guy that I had many battles with. It was great to see so many of Jeff's loved ones there, including his daughter Stacie, his grandsons and many others, to pay tribute to Jeff. The game was played in true Jeff spirit. It was at times serious but always good-natured. I want to thank the Yarra Junction Cricket Club for taking the initiative of hosting the day and bringing on the first of what will be many matches in memory of Jeff Long. I look forward to being there next year. May he rest in peace.

        From there it was on to the Wesburn Junior Football Club where I was on the barbecue and then on the dunking machine. It was lucky that it was a hot day because the locals are definitely good on the handball. I spent the majority of the day underwater, but it was great to see the community again come together to raise funds for the juniors, have fun and connect with their mates. I want to thank the president,

        , and all the volunteers at the Wesburn Junior Football Club. I also thank the president of the Warburton-Millgrove senior club, Steve Noonan who was there on the day. They gave up so much of their time so that others could enjoy the community spirit.
