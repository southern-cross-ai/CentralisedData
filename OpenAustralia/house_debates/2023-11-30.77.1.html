         Order! The member will pause. I'm going to ask him to state the question again because there is far too much noise from the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>
         and members on my right. The same rules apply to everyone. Questions are going to be heard in silence. It's not a free-for-all. You don't give commentary during questions. If you want to comment during the answer, well, go right ahead, but, for my job, I have to listen to the questions. The member for Wannon will state his question again.

In fact, the High Court only directed the release of the plaintiff, NZYQ, in that case.

Isn't it the case that the minister has misled the parliament?

           I thank the shadow minister for that extraordinary question. Let me be very, very, very clear.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Court" rel="nofollow">
            The High Court
           </a>
           , in its decision, required the release of individuals in similar circumstances to the plaintiff, NZYQ. The government had to comply with this, as any government would. The opposition's claims to the contrary, including those of the shadow Attorney-General, a former first law officer of this country, are baseless, wrong and, frankly, unworthy. A former attorney-general, not from this side of politics, former senator Brandis, had this to say, and I think his comments are worth listening to:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I have not disguised my concern at attacks upon the institutions of the law: the courts and those who practice in them. To attack those institutions is to attack the rule of law itself.
          </p>
          <p>
           He went on to say, in his valedictory remarks:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           It is for the Attorney-General always to defend the rule of law, sometimes from political colleagues who fail to understand it or are impatient of the limitations it may impose upon executive power.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is a very apt comment now, and members opposite should have regard to it, and they should be ashamed.
