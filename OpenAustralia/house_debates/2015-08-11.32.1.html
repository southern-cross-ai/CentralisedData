         Castle Hill
        </a>
        dominates Townsville's skyline. It is one of the most beautiful parts in the world. It is 938 feet high, 2.6 kilometres up and 2.6 kilometres down. Normally, I drive people up there but not on the weekend, because on Saturday at two o'clock I blew the starting horn for Livin Hot On The Hill—a charity where people walked up and down the hill for 24 hours. The Livin organisation held a team's race and raised over $40,000. It was about youth suicide prevention—It Ain't Weak to Speak. They had limited the charity walk to 600 people. If the people of Townsville are not riding push bikes to Cairns for Kids with Cancer or if the ADF is not doing a 24-hour challenge, we are walking up and down that hill. Apparently, people run up it and everything like that. Cars were banned.

        What a great city in which we live! It is about the use of people, the use of our great tourist attraction and the use of our great facilities in Townsville to show what is good about our city and also to show that we care for more than just ourselves. Cliffo and Bec and the team at HOTFM did a fantastic job keeping people happy all night. They slept in the evening. Everyone had a great time. They were still smiling at two o'clock the next day, but they slept pretty well the night after, though, because there had not been much sleep going on before that. It was a fantastic event and it was great to be a supporter of it.
