         Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006
        </a>
        is a further instalment of the government’s response to the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system. That report was tabled in June 2005, some 16 months ago. The government’s response to the report came about one year ago. It is perhaps regrettable that this response, in the form of this bill, has taken that period of time to come before the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill makes three principle amendments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force_Discipline_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force Discipline Act
        </a>
        . First, it creates the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Military_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Military Court
        </a>
        . Second, it creates military juries. Third, it creates a power for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Chief of the Defence Force
        </a>
        to set up what is titled a ‘Chief of Defence Force commission of inquiry’, which I will explain a little further in the course of my contribution. The bill also provides for changed appeal provisions, categorises offences for the purpose of trial and makes a number of other consequential amendments, including transitional arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding the attitude of the opposition to the bill, we should state that our general position is that, while we recognise the proposed legislation at this stage is an improvement on the current state of affairs, it is far from adequate in the structural changes that it proposes. In particular, fundamentally there is a significant gap between the government’s response to the Senate committee report and the committee’s actual recommendations. At the heart of this is the government’s acceptance of the view that the military justice system should remain within the defence hierarchy and not be removed to a civilian model as the committee recommended. In other words, we have perpetuated a situation where the military judges the military or, as commentators have said, where Caesar judges Caesar.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee’s unanimous all-party view was that reform was essential. Until the essential reform of making the military justice system truly independent—that is, outside the chain of military command—the system will remain compromised or at least apparently biased in perception and perhaps unfair and will continue to fail those who seek justice. The bill does not achieve that separation. In fact, this bill is not the groundbreaking reform that the government claims.
       </p>
       <p>
        That, by the way, is also the view of the Senate committee. Government members have pressured the minister to significantly amend the bill. We note and we recognise the government has made significant amendments that have been provided to the opposition today. We respect the fact that the government has at least apparently shown respect to some of the recommendations of the committee. Obviously we have not had the opportunity to examine the full extent of those amendments in the time available. While we will not be standing in the way of the amendments passing through the House today, we reserve our right to examine the amendments in greater detail and respond appropriately in the Senate by rejecting them, amending them or proposing our own amendments to more closely reflect the recommendations of the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I indicated, the amendments that we have seen do address some of the issues, but, as a matter of principle, that structural separation between the military judging the military and what we advocate—that is, a complete separation so that the justice system is and is perceived to be fair and independent—has not been achieved. The simple reason for Labor’s opposition is that the so-called ‘new system’ remains part of the military hierarchy, staffed by military personnel and without any of the attributes which denote proper systems of justice in the modern world. The use of the word ‘independent’ by the minister to describe the new system is, with the greatest respect, simply wrong; it is nothing of the kind.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bottom line is that the government wants no systematic reform to military justice and appears happy to fudge the edges so that the dysfunctional system will effectively remain in place. As a result, Australia’s fine men and women in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        will continue to endure a system of justice which is less than the community standard. We believe they deserve nothing less than the community standard that the majority of Australians have an entitlement to.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to understand the committee’s recommendations for a military court, to look at those recommendations in some detail and to compare them to the legislation that has been presented. In brief, the committee was critical of the current system for a number of very good reasons. The committee agreed that the control of the exercise of discipline in the ADF is an essential part of the chain of command. But it also said that acceptance of that was not unconditional, there had to be a balance and there was none in the current system. To quote from the committee report:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The weaknesses in the system, described in submissions and evidence … evident in crossjurisdictional comparison, identified in academic writings, and highlighted in recent Australian judicial decisions, all suggest that current structures are adversely affecting the rights of Service personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is the committee’s unanimous comment, which should not be lightly disregarded. Fundamental to the point the committee made was the fact that the system of justice available to ADF personnel, compared with that available to each member of Australian society, is dramatically inconsistent. To quote again from the committee:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In an era where open and accountable governance is increasingly demanded by the citizenry, all arms of Government must be seen to deliver rigorous, fair and impartial outcomes—the military justice system should not be exempt.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again, from a common-sense point of view, none of us would cavil at that comment. In fact, there is no end of quotations from the committee which, by implication, oppose the government’s model insofar as it does not achieve that separation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will now deal with the key elements, starting with the military court. The proposed court replaces the current disciplinary tribunals—that is, the processes of court martials and defence magistrate trials. Given the perceived bias, compromise, unfairness and abuse of individual rights entailed in the old system, the Senate committee recommended that a new military court be established of similar nature to those established under chapter III of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Constitution
        </a>
        . As such, the court would be established outside the chain of command and would operate in the same way as the civil court, with independently appointed judges in the standard manner considering all evidence fairly with all due process. Judges would be drawn from experienced and well-qualified legal people in the community. Defence experience would be a secondary criterion to judicial expertise. As such, they would have similar security of tenure to other civil judges and would be appointed by the Governor-General. In short, the committee could see no reason for such a court to retain any trappings of the military.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, in the second paragraph of the explanatory memorandum, it is wrongly asserted that the provision in this bill—that is, the government’s proposal—is the direct implementation of the committee’s recommendation. It is nothing of the sort. While the Senate committee did recommend the creation of a military court within the DFDA, it was certainly nothing like the one proposed in this bill. In fact, the government’s proposal differs little from the system of court martial and Defence Force magistrate that it purports to replace.
       </p>
       <p>
        The model proposed in the bill does the following: It creates the military court within the Defence Discipline Act. Its judges must be serving officers of legal experience. Terms of appointment are only for five years. Reappointment will only occur in exceptional circumstances. On the conclusion of their term, judges are to be compulsorily retired. If they reach retiring age during the term they are also disqualified. Part-time judges are not allowed to engage in any other employment outside their duties. If a judge no longer meets his or her individual service deployment requirements they may be dismissed. Nominees are put to the minister for appointment by a departmental committee. The chief military judge is to be of a rank no lower than one-star general, which is equivalent to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMP" rel="nofollow">
         DMP
        </a>
        and the Registrar. A military judge is to be of no lower rank than commander or equivalent. Finally, staffing resources are to be supplied from the defence members and public servants employed under the Public Service Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        We do note, as I have mentioned, that amendments will be moved by the government today to modify these proposals to some degree, but in no way, shape or form is this body anything like a civilian court that non-serving members of the Australian community are entitled to access when seeking redress for a grievance or when defending their rights or defending themselves against an alleged impropriety. In particular, there is no way that this model can be described as independent. Clearly, it is part and parcel of the chain of command. The minister’s fine words change nothing. Indeed, as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Advocate" rel="nofollow">
         Judge Advocate
        </a>
        General of the ADF has stated in evidence to the Senate committee:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This court looks like a tribunal.
       </p>
       <p>
        We agree. The assertion contained in the explanatory memorandum is just presentational nonsense. The consequences, however, are very serious. Again, as the Judge Advocate points out in his evidence to the committee:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The court will have complete and exclusive Australian jurisdiction over members of the ADF outside Australia. Given the present and likely future tempo of operations and exercises, it is entirely foreseeable, if not likely, that there will be charges of the most serious offences such as rape and murder against members of the ADF at some stage. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC" rel="nofollow">
         AMC
        </a>
        would be the only court which would have jurisdiction. The notion that such charges would be dealt with by a body described as a tribunal is extraordinary.
       </p>
       <p>
        We agree with that. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill represents a wasted opportunity to establish a military court with proper independence and status.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor’s view is that, if this court is to remain, it should have its jurisdiction limited to military service disciplinary matters where it is perhaps appropriate to have a tribunal functioning but not in respect of those serious matters, particularly matters of criminality to which I have referred. As a minimum it should not preside over civilian criminal offences committed overseas. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Law Council of Australia
        </a>
        is equally scathing in its criticism of the proposed court—not just for legal reasons but also for practical reasons—and its impact on recruitment, retention and the strong perception of lack of independence.
       </p>
       <p>
        In legal terms there has long been a debate about the authority of military tribunals. They have been challenged in the High Court for their lack of jurisdictional independence and impartiality. The view expressed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Advocate_General" rel="nofollow">
         Judge Advocate General
        </a>
        is that the closer such a tribunal can be aligned to the arrangements for a court established under chapter III of the Constitution the less likely that a court or tribunal will be subject to challenge. The statement is significant, as we know that there are currently new applications challenging the authority of the current system in the High Court. The pity is that, if the government had accepted the committee’s recommendations for a military court akin to those established under chapter III of the Constitution, this doubt would have been avoided.
       </p>
       <p>
        The warnings of the Judge Advocate General and the Law Council in respect of recruitment and retention have also been dismissed by government. With respect, that is extremely short-sighted. In other words, if the parents of a young person contemplating military life are yet to be convinced that their child will have the same rights as any other private citizen to address their grievances or defend their rights, they are going to be less inclined to permit their child to enlist in the defence forces. One can only wonder as to the extent to which the poor state of military justice has been a disincentive to recruitment. Indeed, those dissatisfied with the redress of their grievances have ultimately left the service of the defence forces as a result of the inadequacy of the current system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apart from the strong concern about perception of bias within the chain of command, which is blindingly obvious, the key question is: who would want to be a military judge under the current arrangements? Skilled and experienced legal people will be very difficult to recruit under these arrangements. There will be a high turnover and continuing loss of skill and experience. Judges inevitably will be of a lower standard than those of civilian society and there will be the inevitable perception of compromise because of their status as serving officers. There will obviously be exceptions. There are and will continue to be incredibly decent and competent and talented people who will put themselves forward for service, but by and large I think the quality of people who will present for service on this new court will not be equivalent to the quality of those in civilian society and there will certainly continue to be the perception of bias.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet the rhetoric and the gloss of the minister’s speech would have us believe differently. Astoundingly, the minister has told us that these judges and the court will no longer be within the chain of command. The minister asserts that the implications for their independence will thereby be removed. To quote the Judge Advocate General, again by way of response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... it is now proposed ... that the military judges will have even less independence, so far as their terms of appointment are concerned, than they have under the existing arrangements. ... To now move to five-year renewable terms, which are not automatic ... considerably reduces the actual and perceived independence of the judges ... and greatly impedes the AMC’s ability to develop experience and excellence.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the record, Labor wants all these limitations removed so that military judges are appointed and removed by the same process as all other judges. Again, we will be looking at the amendments to see if they achieve that. The final criticism is that the court is not a court of record. Again, this detracts from the status of the court as a genuine court and judicial authority. This shortcoming is a serious one, particularly as the court is supposed to be independent. Its decisions are appellable and its powers are substantial, including the power to punish for contempt. Labor believes, in summary, that it is essential that the court be a court of record. If that does not occur, the losers will again be serving members of our defence forces.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also provides for the use of military juries comprising six serving personnel of no lesser rank than the accused, with a decision by a majority of four. The positive value of this proposal is that at least there are to be jury facilities with the sole role of determining guilt on the facts; we recognise that that is a forward step. As we know, trial by jury is widely accepted as a necessary safeguard to individual liberty and is, in fact, protected by section 80 of the Constitution. These military juries, however, are less onerous in their formation than civilian juries, particularly for indictable offences; we see that as a serious inconsistency. Neither the explanatory memorandum nor the second reading speech of the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence provides any justification for that difference. We note that this was also a reservation of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, these differences were also subject to criticism by the Judge Advocate General who, in his recent annual report, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... it is desirable that these points of difference be limited to those ... [offences] ... which are essential for the proper functioning of the military justice system.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why, quite simply, Labor senators, in their dissenting remarks in the Senate committee’s report on the bill, recommended that, for criminal trials overseas at least, juries equivalent to civilian standards be used. We note the amendments to be moved today again modify these arrangements to some degree and we intend to have a careful look at those amendments to assess their adequacy before responding in detail in the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another issue is the Chief of Defence Force commission of inquiry. This in fact does have something to recommend it, in that such inquiries will be mandatory and the appointees who conduct them will be civilians. This would appear to be somewhat of a contradiction to the hardline attitude that the government has taken on the military court, where only ADF personnel can serve. So what is it about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
         CDF
        </a>
        commission which is so different as to permit independence from the chain of command? It would seem at least that the frequent tragic deaths by suicide of young people in particular has hit home. So it should. If this is a personal expression by the Chief of the Defence Force of his commitment to fix the problem—and we accept his genuineness in his statements—then we are pleased that it has been reflected in this proposal.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we support this proposal because it is a step in the right direction, it does raise the question as to why the principle has not been followed across the legislation. It is a great pity the initiative was not taken many years ago. In the last decade, 79 ADF personnel have taken their own lives. That is obviously both appalling and distressing, yet we know so little of the causes, except that bullying and harassment seem to be common elements. Having an improved system of investigation by a truly independent body is a good start. Beyond that measure, however, it is difficult to see any other changes that are for the better.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, that culture of bullying and harassment still appears to be entrenched in the culture of at least lower ranks—we recognise the genuineness of the senior ranks of the military—and not enough is being done to arrest that culture. For example, of those 79 suicides to which I have referred, no disciplinary action was ever taken against a single person. This is perhaps further evidence of the link between a failed military justice system and failed discipline. The government would like us to think that the evil of bullying has been exorcised. There have been some media reports suggesting that that has been the case. We recognise, certainly at senior levels, that there has been a desire to stamp out the culture, but it is far from a satisfactory situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has not been long since the death of Trooper Lawrence from heatstroke in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        last year, on which no action was taken against any individual. The coroner found the death to be the result of negligence; Comcare is suing Defence for the maximum penalty under the Commonwealth occupational health and safety law but, again, no individual has been held accountable. So, while a truly independent inquiry process is a welcome improvement, in the end, the result may be no different unless there is a commitment to follow through with appropriate action.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, as some have speculated publicly in recent days, it is a pity this provision was not in place in time for the inquiry into the death of Private Kovco. In particular, we have seen criticism by the mother of the late Private Kovco regarding the process that was adopted in this inquiry into her son’s death. However, this proposal is also subject to some serious criticism from the Law Council, again unheeded by the government. The Law Council’s view is that, if this provision is to be entrenched through regulation, there may be undesirable consequences. The Law Council believes that, given the seriousness of this provision, the essential provisions should be in this bill and not in regulations. We agree with that.
       </p>
       <p>
        There may also be practical considerations which have been overlooked. First, it is not considered practical to have such an inquiry into every death in the ADF—including road accidents, which we accept. We note that the Law Council includes suicides in that category. It must be noted that we do take issue with the Law Council there. We believe suicide to be of such significance that there should in each and every case of suicide be an appropriate inquiry. Finally, the Law Council is concerned at the availability of civilian judges to conduct what could be up to 40 inquiries a year when the demands on the judicial system are already very high. The council has suggested that there may be a wider pool of senior counsel to draw upon. We also recognise that as a sensible recommendation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding the government’s defence mythology, we note that the government’s justification for the bill and its provisions are set out in the explanatory memorandum. The philosophy is, quite frankly, based in centuries past. With respect to the appointment of judges, the government said, ‘A knowledge and background in the military environment and culture is required.’ With the greatest respect, we think that is no longer a relevant proposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those in command have been brought up to believe that, once in the forces, the normal civilian rules of behaviour, proper process and civil rights do not apply, and that is unacceptable. It is the very culture they seek to preserve which in many ways is at the heart of some of the terrible problems that we have seen in the military justice system. For many, that is why there has been no justice at all, with tremendous distress being caused to families. This obsession with the difference of military life to civilian life is one of the great myths which are continually promulgated to deny access to the rights and fair, independent process guaranteed to all non-military members of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The natural consequence of these assertions is that a failed military justice system must result in a failed system of military discipline. We would not like to think that was true, but, as the Senate committee found, there is plenty of evidence. For example, in recent times the government admitted that there were 88 cases of proved sexual harassment in the ADF in 2004-05. The most severe punishment that we saw was a compulsory posting. This is quite obviously grossly inadequate and certainly below that which could be expected in a civilian society. Certainly any victim of that harassment would have expected much stronger action. So, again, these measures are in many ways—if you look at it in that context—virtually a charade to prop up a compromised and defective system, where again we see a perpetuation of Caesar judging Caesar.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next bald assertion made to support this bill is that ‘the AMC must be deployable and be able to sit in theatre and on operations’. Again, this statement is questionable. A military tribunal sitting overseas is a rarity. It is claimed, for instance, that military preparedness requirements and the physical demands of sitting in an operational environment require such a military focused court. Frankly, to keep perpetuating this nonsense is an insult. We are told in paragraph 4 of the explanatory memorandum, for instance, that the AMC must have credibility with the Defence Force. Again, to what extent does it have credibility with the Defence Force when members of the Defence Force cannot be satisfied of its impartiality?
       </p>
       <p>
        The final part of the guiding philosophy for these changes is that the judges appointed will, as serving members, be subject to military discipline, including the need for training. In other words, judges are part of the system, not independent of it. These assertions are nothing but mythology. They in themselves are no justification for the legislation—and, as we have argued, the legislation in and of itself does not change a thing for the quality of military justice. The changes are basically a very thin veneer designed to demonstrate a lot of activity, wrapped up in empty but fine sounding words, but ultimately are preserving and sustaining a failed system. For those reasons, I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:

“while not declining a second reading for this Bill, the House believes that as the provisions for the establishment of an Australian Military Court are not in line with Chapter 3 of the Constitution as recommended by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee report of June 2005, and as the appointments to the court and juries are restricted to serving military personnel, the new court can never be separate from the chain of command and the provisions of the Bill therefore maintain the longstanding unsatisfactory compromise which denies the true independence, fairness and objectivity essential for the proper functioning of the military justice system”.

        <p>
         I come to this debate on the

          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         and its men and women. I represent Australia’s largest Army base. I represent a community that has two brigades—3rd Brigade and 11th Brigade. I represent a community that has three battalions, multiple regiments and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Air Force
         </a>
         . I mix quite widely with all ranks of the Australian Defence Force.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill before the House today is one that the senior commanders of the ADF focus on. It is not something that the lower ranks ever mention to you. There has been long frustration within our senior command ranks in relation to the military justice system. There has been a lot of effort and time consumed which really did not need to be consumed in addressing the issues that have happened in the past in relation to military justice. Certainly, it is another issue in relation to the offences that have been committed from time to time—the silly things that have happened, the things that frustrate our commanders that should never happen and the things that tend to reduce confidence in the professionalism of the Defence Force. Thankfully, only a very small number of people are involved in this, because it takes a lot of the time of our senior commanders, right up to the chiefs of the services, to deal with these particular matters which should never have happened.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was very much in the nation’s interests that we had a Senate inquiry into the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system. That inquiry has subsequently reported. Out of that inquiry came the proposal to establish a permanent court, to be known as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Military_Court" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Military Court
         </a>
         . It will replace the current system of courts martial and Defence Force magistrates under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force_Discipline_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force Discipline Act
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         There has been some concern expressed by the opposition, but I am not hearing that concern from serving members of the Australian Defence Force. I heard the member for Barton express a concern in relation to the independence of the proposed new court. My response to that would be: does anyone really believe that judges appointed to the court would not operate in an independent way? Does anyone really believe that they would allow their professionalism to come under scrutiny? I do not. I do not think anybody else does. I think judges in our community who join the Australian Military Court will be professional people, as they are in the public sector. They would not allow their independence to be questioned by anybody. We have a very fine tradition in our legal system in Australia in relation to this. I also point out that if any judge did allow their independence to be questioned then the community and the military would soon know about it. I do not share the concern of the member for Barton.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Barton also said that he felt there would be difficulty in recruiting judges. Again, that is not my experience. I have seen a very fine law officer from Townsville, a senior judge, appointed into the military. Another senior judge asked me, ‘How do I go about being considered for the Australian Military Court?’ These are senior judges with many years experience who want to be on the Australian Military Court. If that is the case in Townsville, that will be the case elsewhere in the country. I find it hard to share that concern of the member for Barton.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are some key points in this legislation; for example, a safeguard such that a military judge will not be eligible for promotion except where the promotion is to enable the person to be appointed to Chief Military Judge—a sensible point. We will see a military jury of peers at a rank not less than the person being charged, which I am pleased to say the member for Barton has supported. There will be two classes of juries, depending on which particular offences are being dealt with. There will also be a reviewing authority for an automatic right of appeal from a summary authority to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC" rel="nofollow">
          AMC
         </a>
         . There will also be an appeals process which will provide that an offender may appeal a conviction and/or punishment.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Director" rel="nofollow">
          The Director
         </a>
         of Military Prosecutions may also appeal against a punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill before the House is a significant element of the overall program of enhancing the military justice system, of having a robust system that will serve the Australian military forces in an independent and impartial way. Certainly the chain of command will not be able to interfere in the operations of the court.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will also be required to make consequential amendments to Defence and other portfolio legislation, for which policy approval has been sought from the Attorney-General and from the Minister for Immigration and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Multicultural Affairs
         </a>
         . In relation to remuneration of judges—an important point—provisions have been included in the bill to preclude a judge or magistrate from a federal, state or territory court appointed as a part-time or acting military judge from receiving remuneration under the DFDA if they receive salary or annual allowances by virtue of their judicial office—a double-dipping provision. I do not think anyone would have any difficulty whatsoever with the common sense of that particular provision. The other element which was important to consider was that, given that the AMC is a federal court and if the term of employment for 10 years is approved, there is an unintended consequence which would see military judges being eligible for pensions under the Judges’ Pensions Act in addition to the military pension that applies to all Defence Force members. That anomaly will be corrected through an amendment of the Judges’ Pensions Act 1968 to prevent the payment of pensions to military judges under that act.
        </p>
        <p>
         I indicated to the parliament that members of the Australian Defence Force with whom I have had contact are quite happy with this proposal. They see that it will work well for the Defence Force, that it will work well for those who appear before the court and for those who have been aggrieved by the person appearing under charge before the court. Therefore, I am able to confidently support this particular legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In closing, I will use one minute of my time to recognise the wonderful service that the men and women of the Australian Defence Force give to this nation—in particular, the wonderful service that the men and women of the Australian Defence Force in Townsville have been providing through service in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">

         who will be ready to be available to do what needs to be done in the nation’s interests. Of course the men and women of the Australian Defence Force are always available to do that. I compliment the serving men and women. Townsville will certainly continue to provide a very effective ready deployment force for our country.

          I support the amendment moved by the member for Barton. Indeed, I congratulate him on a very well-considered, well-balanced contribution to the second reading debate on the
          <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2621" rel="nofollow">
           Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2006
          </a>
          . I commend the things that he has had to say to members.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am disappointed that, after having made his contribution, the member for Herbert has left the chamber already, because there were a couple of issues that I really wanted to take up with him. He said that members of the ADF, particularly around Townsville, with whom he has had contact are happy with this proposal and generally happy with military justice the way it is. My understanding of the member for Herbert is that he spends a heck of a lot of his time in the officers mess. I really urge him to get out of the officers mess and to go down and talk to some of the diggers and to some of the senior
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCO" rel="nofollow">
           NCO
          </a>
          s and listen to some of the stories that they have to tell about military justice.
         </p>
         <p>
          The member for Herbert is right when he praises the work, the professionalism, the courage and the dedication of members of the ADF, whether they are serving in Australia, Afghanistan or Iraq—or wherever else it is that they may be deployed. He is right: they do provide Australia with a great service and this service is recognised by our allies. I think it is more broadly recognised, too, that military justice in Australia needs to be dragged into this century, just the same as it has been for the allies that we so often serve with—the Americans, the British and the Canadians. Our ADF members, our young men and women who serve on deployment with these allies, are entitled to the same levels of military justice and to the same levels of fairness within the justice system that our allies receive, but so often they do not.
         </p>
         <p>
          You only have to look at some of the inquiries that have gone on in recent years that have been generated because of concerns about our military justice. Some of these have been identified in the Senate report that was handed down last June, including the 2002-03 WA Coroner’s investigation of the

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
           QC
          </a>
          inquiry into military justice in the ADF; the 2001 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade’s
          <i>
           Rough justice?
          </i>
          inquiry into allegations of brutality in the Army’s parachute battalion; the 1999 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade military justice procedures in the ADF inquiry; the 1998 Commonwealth Ombudsman’s own motion investigation into how the ADF responds to allegations of serious incidents and offences; and the 1997 Abadee study into the judicial system under the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force_Discipline_Act" rel="nofollow">
           Defence Force Discipline Act
          </a>
          , which Justice Abadee began in 1995.
         </p>
         <p>
          Each of these inquiries, as the Senate report points out, ‘has identified, to a greater or lesser degree, shortcomings in the military justice system’. The report makes this statement about the various inquiries:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Against this background of almost ten years of rolling inquiries into the military justice system, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Chief of the Defence Force
          </a>
          (
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
           CDF
          </a>
          ) recently expressed his view that ‘The military justice system is sound, even if it has sometimes not been applied as well as we would like ... I have every confidence that on the whole the military justice system is effective and serves the interests of the nation and of the Defence Force and its people’.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is interesting that the committee report notes that ‘the committee cannot with confidence agree with this assessment’. In this report they were obviously talking about the recently retired CDF, General Cosgrove, a man for whom I have an immense respect. But I recently read General Cosgrove’s book, entitled
          <i>
           My Story.
          </i>
          In his book, which is worth a read, he complains about the process of some of these inquiries, and he is obviously far from happy with the outcomes. He said that in his view, and I paraphrase him, ‘The process of these inquiries has sometimes been unfair to the ADF’ and that these inquiries ‘unjustly reflected on the processes of the ADF’. That is just a rough paraphrase of what he had to say.
         </p>
         <p>
          That is his view, and I think General Cosgrove is certainly entitled to hold that view. But I take a different view—that is, military justice in this day of deployment to so many parts of the world, in the current environment where justice has moved on within the community, seems not to have moved on within the ADF. Indeed it has stalled and is a cumbersome beast within the ADF, and it certainly does not always look after or provide fairness and justice to members of the ADF. I recognise that there is a reluctance at the senior officer level within the ADF to accept that and to listen to voices such as that of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McClelland" rel="nofollow">
           Robert McClelland
          </a>
          or those of those who were involved in this Senate inquiry. It is a pity that the minister himself has through this legislation not better responded to some of the recommendations made by the Senate committee.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a member of the House of Representatives I greatly dislike having to sit by and watch a rubber stamp applied in this place and seeing legislation simply pushed through to the Senate. That is what will happen here: the very good amendment moved by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
           ALP
          </a>
          spokesman on Defence will not get up—it should but it will not. So I call on the Senate to properly review this legislation, to consider the amendment moved by the ALP in this place and to measure the legislation before us today against what was recommended and proposed and what was covered and investigated in that 2005 report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. If they do that, and do it fairly and with open minds, they will see that this legislation falls far short of what they recommended. What is worse is that some of the proposals in here are simply unworkable and will not serve military justice well in this country, nor will they serve those members of the ADF who from time to time have been caught up in the unfairness and injustice of this military justice system. Let’s look at some of the things that the Senate committee identified during their investigations into military justice. On page 11 of the committee’s report they list a number of the problems and issues that they say, quite rightly, should lead to changes in military justice. I will list some of them:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           inordinate delay in investigation of alleged offences—in some cases investigations have gone on for several years;

          <li>
           poor quality investigation of alleged offences—such as inappropriate questioning of civilian family members, failure to check easily obtainable exculpatory evidence, failure to liaise closely with civilian agencies;

           lack of independence in the investigation of alleged offences;

         </ul>
         <p>
          The member for Herbert said that the people he talks to in Townsville are happy with military justice. I do not know who he is talking to, and that is why I have suggested to him, and why indeed I urge him, to get out of the officers mess and go and talk to the other ranks and hear what they have to say, because page 51 of the Senate report notes:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          For ten years now, there have been increasing calls from servicemen and women and their families that all is not well in the military justice system. Repeated inquiries have resulted in piecemeal change but some fundamental principles remain unchallenged. The serious issues raised in the 150 plus submissions made to this committee—including by extremely senior ranks of the military—make it plain that wholesale review and reform of the principles underpinning the current system of military justice is now required.
         </p>
         <p>
          What we see today is more of the same. It is more of that piecemeal approach. Although this legislation does make some improvements—and that is why the ALP will support the legislation—it falls short of the overall reforms it should have made. It falls short of what it should have done. That is why I think there is a very strong requirement for the Senate to address its task, to refer back to this very good report and to measure the expectations of this report against what we actually see in legislation. And I hope that they might have a good look at the amendments put forward by the member for Barton, because really this legislation does need improvement.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was involved in bringing to the House some years ago the case of a warrant officer who was on service with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
           SAS
          </a>
          , the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service" rel="nofollow">
           Special Air Service
          </a>
          , in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
           East Timor
          </a>
          . This particular warrant officer, along with other members of his patrol, was involved in an ambush which required some fairly quick and fairly robust response. This warrant officer returned fire, and the patrol withdrew from the place of the ambush, bringing with them a couple of the bodies that they had killed. To cut a long story short, this warrant officer was subsequently charged with kicking those bodies, a charge which ultimately he was found to have been innocent of. But the investigation and the threat that hung over the head of this very dedicated and professional soldier created incredible stress and pressure for this man and for his family.
         </p>
         <p>
          The investigations into this man went on for years. He was at one stage threatened with being charged with murder. He was pulled off deployment when the troops that he had been training were deployed to Iraq. He was told: ‘Because of these charges, you can’t go with your men.’ That single thing was nearly enough to destroy him, because he had a very close bond with them and he had trained these men for a period of time. Because of these charges, he was pulled off deployment.

          It took a long time for this man to get justice, and he only got justice in the end because two senators took up his cause and went in to bat for him. But eventually, some years after he was charged, some years after he was subjected to incredible pressures and stress, the army put out a press release, with Lieutenant General Leahy—and I congratulated him at the time—publicly apologising to this man. Part of the press release said this:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Army acknowledged that errors had been made during the investigation and prosecution of an Australian Interfet soldier charged with kicking two dead bodies in East Timor in 1999 ...
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          …            …            …
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          “These were serious allegations that needed to be pursued vigorously. The soldier was found not guilty on all charges.”
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          “I acknowledge there were organisational failures such as the length of the investigation. I also acknowledge problems with the quality of statements taken from witnesses and with Army press releases.” ...
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Inquiry Officer found that the soldier’s complaints were substantiated. He concluded that the military police investigation was deficient in a number of respects and had taken too long. The administrative action taken against the soldier, of which he was also found not guilty, while possible under current policy, in this case, on reflection would have been best not taken.

          We heard the member for Herbert say that, in his contacts, the members of the ADF are happy with what they have. But what he has told the House today stands in stark contrast to the experiences of that senior special services soldier. It stands in stark contrast to what General Leahy himself said in that press release. It stands in stark contrast to the evidence that was put before the Senate inquiry and in stark contrast to what many family members of serving ADF personnel have put before the inquiry.
         </p>
         <p>
          I will just say once again: this legislation, while I acknowledge it as having some improvements, falls short of the requirement for this government to accept its responsibilities and to have brought forward a piece of legislation which did recognise the need for justice and the need for fairness for our members of the ADF as they go about doing a very professional job under very many demanding circumstances in many parts of the world. The government could have done better with this legislation, and it should have done better.
