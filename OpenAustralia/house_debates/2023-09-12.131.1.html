        I'm standing here this evening bolstered by the knowledge that my recent heart health check, which I took right here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        yesterday, showed that, thankfully, my heart is in pretty good shape. It checked cholesterol, total lipids,

        and triglycerides, as well as blood pressure. It also showed my blood sugar levels, which help indicate if prediabetes is present. It was as easy as me warming up my hands to have a finger prick and some blood taken and then a blood pressure cuff. It was very easy for me to do that here in Parliament House, and I want to encourage people to get their heart checked at the

        . Why should we be monitoring our heart health? It's a topic that affects each and every one of us, regardless of where we live or who we are. The heart isn't just a vital organ pumping blood throughout our bodies; it's a symbol of life, love and vitality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Heart disease, sadly, is the leading cause of death in Australia, but the majority of heart issues can be prevented through adopting healthy behaviours, eating well, exercising regularly, not smoking, reducing our alcohol intake and keeping an eye on our blood pressure. We all know what we should be doing, but sometimes it's harder to put it into practice. Having a heart health check is an important step towards protecting our heart. What does it mean for people in the community of my electorate of Paterson? What was so interesting yesterday was that not only was I fortunate enough to get my health checked but also, which was the really critical thing, I got some incredible statistics about the people who live in my electorate of Paterson. Before I delve into the specifics of heart health in Paterson—and let me just say that we have some very big-hearted people in Paterson, who are incredibly generous—I want to take a moment to understand what heart health means. Heart health encompasses the overall wellbeing of our cardiovascular system, which includes the heart and blood vessels. It's the foundation of a long and active life. Unfortunately heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, including here in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Paterson, as in many other regions, we have to pay close attention to our heart to ensure a healthier and brighter future for ourselves and our loved ones. Statistics on heart health in Paterson show we have a population of more than 164,000 people, and, of those, our two most at-risk groups of people are the 18 per cent who are aged 65 and over and our Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        people, who make up six per cent of our population, which is almost double what it is in most electorates around the country. Alarmingly, between 2012 and 2016, Paterson showed heart related hospital admissions were at a rate of 47 per 10,000 people, which is well above the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        average of 39 in 10,000 people and above the national average of 42 in 10,000. Our rate was 47 in 10,000, demonstrating that we're not in a good place when it comes to taking care of our heart health. This means Paterson has a prevalence of heart related issues and a bit of a way to go to be more heart healthy.
       </p>
       <p>
        To gain a better understanding of the state of heart health in Paterson, I want to have a look at some more statistics. The reason I'm sharing these is that I thought they were not only incredibly interesting but also so important. I want my electors in Paterson to live long and healthy lives. Heart disease affects a significant portion of the population in Paterson, just as it does the rest of Australia. It's estimated that one in six Australians has some form of cardiovascular disease. The numbers don't lie. Common risk factors contributing to heart disease in Paterson include poor dietary habits leading to obesity. Paterson sits at 42 per cent compared to the national average of 31. Physical inactivity is at 69 per cent compared to the national average of 66 per cent. Smoking rates are at 19, which is higher than the national average of 13 per cent. Excessive alcohol consumption and high blood pressure sit at 24 per cent, just over the national average of 23 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        These risk factors are prevalent not only in Paterson but also in many other regional areas across the country. Alarmingly, Paterson has a heart disease mortality rate of 64 in 100,000 people, which is the same as the national average. Listen, I get it; it's not easy. I'm not standing here as some role model on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMI" rel="nofollow">
         BMI
        </a>
        index. In fact, I'm over, but I am proud to say I've lost seven kilograms in two months, and I am really focusing on trying to be a better, fitter and healthier version of myself. I'm inviting everyone in Paterson to come on this journey with me. Rather than having a soft drink, have a glass of water. If you want to have a soft drink, have a glass of water before it or after it to try and cut down. You don't have to cut everything out; you just have to swap for some healthier options, and that's what I've been doing. I know it's hard, but together we can actually do this, and maybe we can save some lives as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        What else can we do about this? Accessible and quality healthcare services are crucial for the early detection and management of heart conditions. In Paterson, we're fortunate to have terrific healthcare facilities, but there are still areas where access to these services can be improved. I know how hard it is to get into a doctor; it's incredibly hard. That's why our government has dedicated an estimated $106.5 billion in the 2023-24 budget to health, of which over $28.3 billion will go to the states for public hospitals and associated health care, and more than $13.2 billion is going to be spent on health services, which will include expenses towards the delivery of population health.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just want to talk about GPs. I think this is so important. We've got many GP practices and have attracted $1.325 million in grants to GP practices in Paterson very recently. Those emails have just gone out. To those GPs who've received those grants, I really know that you'll make the most of it. It's become more expensive to run a GP practice. I know the costs continue to go up. That's why we've put these grants in place. At the end of the day, it does help with better primary health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1973, 50 years ago, about 50 per cent of medical graduates decided to become GPs. They went into general practice. Today it's less than 12 per cent. Again, we've got to be encouraging our brilliant young medical students, once they finish medical school. General practice as a speciality. It's incredibly rewarding. It's one of those places where you can put your medical training, your intuition, your love of your community and your love of fellow humans to the best use possible, and it can make such a difference not only giving people better health care but saving lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why I think heart health is so important. I want to give a big shoutout to all the GPs in my electorate of Paterson as well as to all of the people who work in general practice across Australia. You are doing an incredible job. We know that it's very hard. We know that medical conditions have become more complex. We know that the technologies and the testing regimes are there. The other day I went for a little prick in my finger and a few drops of blood, and we were able to talk about my cholesterol and show me that I'm not prediabetic, which I'm so grateful for. There are these things. So, if you're at home wondering how your heart is, wondering if the old ticker is doing okay, it's actually a lot easier these days than you think to get some testing done, and you can get it at your GP. I encourage people to go along and do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now that we've got a better understanding of heart health in Paterson and how the government is contributing to solutions, it's imperative that we take proactive steps to promote better cardiovascular health within our community. We need to take our own health back into our own hands. There are strategies we can adopt. We can get out and walk 10,000 steps a day. We can try and eat five serves of veggies and two serves of fruit. We can go for that walk and really try to have a positive mindset.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know this is not the whole thing. Obviously, heart disease can be a genetic thing as well. But go to your doctor and really look after yourself and know that you've got a government that cares about you, that cares about your heart health and that is putting the money behind it. This is concrete. This is what we want to do. I want you to live longer not just because I hope you vote for me but because I do want you to have happy and healthy lives. And I also want your kids to do well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Paterson, we can do this. Let's strive to have better and healthier hearts. I hope, next year, when I see the figures, they'll be better.
