       <p>
        A few months ago I reported to the House excellent news from my electorate of Spence: that the opening of Saint Augustine's parish toy library in Salisbury in mid-August was a fantastic event, and one I was glad to have been part of in representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . It doubled the number of toy libraries in Spence to two, joining the Gawler &amp; Districts Elsie Ey Toy Library in Gawler, a place giving joy to generations of kids now for over 46 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Toy libraries are wonderful organisations that strive to support children, schools, families and local communities. This is why I was pleased to be joined by the Minister for Social Services just a few short weeks ago when we opened a new toy library in Paralowie. It can mean a great deal to a child, especially one coming from such a low socioeconomic background, being able to play with a new toy or puzzle every time those doors are open. I know this to be true, as I myself was a frequent visitor at our local toy library in my formative years. I can still remember some of the experiences I had to this day. It's why my praise and support for toy libraries is not just one in principle but one of lived experience, and one that I hope children across Spence can enjoy and benefit from just as much as I was lucky enough to when I was younger.
