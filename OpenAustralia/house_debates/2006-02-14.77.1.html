       <p>
        I rise in the chamber today to recognise Bloomhill Cancer Help, a self-funded charity on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        with public benevolence status which was founded in 1997 by Margaret Gargan, a registered nurse who was in charge of a cancer ward at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Charles_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Prince Charles Hospital
        </a>
        in Brisbane. She also worked on the Sunshine Coast. In 1987 Margaret personally experienced a diagnosis of breast cancer and vowed at that time that one day she would set up an organisation that really supported people in the way they need to be supported—that is, from the time of diagnosis onwards. Bloomhill is situated on a 10-acre property. The property is owned by a charitable trust and is run by a management committee. The patron is Raelene Boyle
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBE" rel="nofollow">
         MBE
        </a>
        , the president is retired naval Commodore Geoff Morton AM, and the immediate past president is Bob Brennan, a well-known Sunshine Coast businessman.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason for developing the Bloomhill model was to fill in the gaps and complement all of the other agencies providing care for people diagnosed with cancer as well as to provide support to their families. Bloomhill is an orthodox medical model that provides complementary therapies and support groups. Bloomhill provides professional care and support from the time of diagnosis onwards. Its professional team is made up of three nurses, including the founder, Margaret Gargan; a counsellor; a volunteer coordinator; and various professional therapists who conduct art therapy, music therapy, massage, reiki and reflexology. It has a general manager who is a professional businesswoman.
       </p>
       <p>
        An additional assessment is made by one of the three major registered nurses and then referrals are made to appropriate modalities. They care for the whole family, not just for the person with the disease, and strongly recommend the mediation classes and support group, carers group retreats, a fun and friendship club and art classes. They keep their fees very low at all times. They ask for people to become members, which is $25 for a single person or $40 for a family. This then entitles them to a free massage. If they are caring for children, whether a child with cancer or one who has a parent with cancer, they are automatically sponsored.
       </p>
       <p>
        They are primarily a volunteer based organisation and have an extensive volunteer program, with over 250 volunteers fulfilling several roles such as management committee members, transport, palliative care, respite during the day or overnight, special buddies for individuals, administration, fundraising and workers in their op shops. Bloomhill’s operating expenses are largely funded through their five op shops and a warehouse, fundraising events, donations and bequests.
       </p>
       <p>
        The property being purchased in the heart of Buderim is now the permanent home. To date, $325,000 has been paid off the purchase price and now only $75,000 is owed. Once the debt on the property is discharged, services will be increased dramatically. Bloomhill is doing amazing work, and I want to compliment all of those people who have been involved with Bloomhill since 1997, when it was established. Being almost nine years old, it has cared for 2,132 people and is currently involved in the support of 577 people. The average number of new clients per year is 400 people. It is a well-known, respected and highly valued organisation within the Sunshine Coast community, having 650 members. I salute them all.
