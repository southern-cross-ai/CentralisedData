        It is my pleasure today to rise and deliver a speech written for me by representatives of Lumen Christi Catholic College, who are present in the chamber today. A big shout out for you guys for travelling three hours and leaving very early in the morning to get here. A big thankyou to Uncle Ossie Cruse for coming along as well. Uncle Ossie is well known to many people across this parliament. He's well known to most people in our area. He's a much respected elder of our community.

        through our support of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. In response to the Uluru statement, the school embarked on a journey to build awareness of the Uluru aims. They hope that the many voices from nations across Australia will be heard. In their college they sought to bring together a choir of voices encouraging makarrata, truth-telling and a voice to parliament. Today the college and its community present a collaborative artwork, and I table on their behalf a document called

        The 2020 project was sparked by passionate discussions between the social justice advocates of the far

        and the Lumen Christi social justice advocates group, which aims to raise awareness and support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Indigenous and non-Indigenous students and staff working together illustrated aspects of local culture. Each corner represents in local language: baringa, the light; monaroo, the people; gudu, the waters; and bobberrer, the mountains. They are also the names of the four college houses. The artwork depicts messenger ducks flying across the night sky carrying our good wishes. Indigenous students are represented in each of the reeds in the foreground. Their pastoral care classes are represented in the collective statements, messages and signatures from 700 students and 100 staff acknowledging the significant local elder Pastor Uncle Ossie Cruse, who was present at Uluru and a signatory of the original Statement from the Heart. The canvas was gifted to the Jigamy community near Eden, and they are proud to be connected in our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Uluru Statement from the Heart tells us that constitutional reforms empower Indigenous people to take a rightful place in their own country. Their children will flourish and their culture will be a gift to the country. Lumen Christi Catholic College looks forward to sharing in the gift, and they support the Uluru Statement from the Heart. A big thank you to the students. I think you can see that the future is in good hands when we have students like these, who are so passionate about reform in our country.
