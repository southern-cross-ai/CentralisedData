        worry a little bit about the levels of freedom and democracy that are taken for granted in this country. We are often caught up in the trappings of political debate and the trivialities that are sometimes associated with that. We fortunately live in a country that has basic human rights. We live in a country that respects democracy and celebrates freedom. Regrettably, that is not something that all countries honour or respect.

        Many of the constituents in my electorate come from a refugee background. Many fled their homelands on the basis of persecution, deprivation of human rights or because the freedoms that they previously enjoyed were trampled by incoming regimes.

        Today it would like to draw attention to one of those groups: the plight of the Laotian community. They have faced a dreadful ordeal over the last 35 years. I was made aware of their issues when I recently received a letter from the

        , formally known as the

         Kingdom of Laos
        </a>
        . They are an incredible group of people who are unwavering in their commitment to restoring democracy and peace in Laos and seek to protect and liberate the citizens of their country from the oppressive regime of the

        The Lao People's Democratic Republic has a tragic and distressing history.

        1947, the national assembly passed the democratic constitution that stresses that all who are born in Lao are free citizens and have equal rights. Despite the Lao National Assembly never declaring war on a foreign country, in April 1953, 6,000
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnamese" rel="nofollow">

        troops invaded the eastern borders of the country and since 1975 have enforced communist rule. Under this tyranny, the peaceful people of Lao have not only had their right to self-determination and personal freedoms trampled but have been forced to witness the brutal murder of their beloved king, queen, prince and all members of the royal Loa family, alongside at least 200,000 innocent people. These events are, by any standards, truly horrific.

        works to lead Lao back to a true future that upholds the democratic constitution. In addition to this phenomenal work, they do what a real government should do: they support and facilitate the development of the Lao people's health, education, culture and economy. It is groups like these that inspire and empower us to fight for human rights. This group has not cowered under the threat and fear of death that continues to prevail in their society. They work tirelessly for the restoration of democracy in their homeland. This is a group of inspirational individuals. I am very proud to work closely with the Laotian community living here in Australia. It is terribly troubling that these issues sometimes go unreported, given the fact that these are very serious issues of human rights abuses.
