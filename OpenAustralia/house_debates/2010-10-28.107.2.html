       <p>
        I would like to talk about unemployment and some very worthwhile initiatives being undertaken to combat unemployment, youth unemployment in particular, in my electorate of Calwell. Calwell, as you would know, Mr Speaker, because you are my neighbour, has a highly diverse cultural and socioeconomic population. Many initiatives in the electorate are geared at promoting community networking and understanding, which in turn help to improve the employment prospects of our people, in particular our young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2006 Census shows that 70.9 per cent of people living in Australia were born here and 22.2 per cent were born overseas. In general terms, in Australia about a quarter of people were born overseas, while in Calwell it is about one-third of the population. As with many other parts of Australia, unemployment affects local people from all cultural backgrounds and it is the local groups and networks which play a significant role in trying to address the unemployment situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is where the ongoing efforts of the Hume Interfaith Leaders Network, established in 2001, play a crucial role in developing understanding and harmony across the many faiths and cultures in my electorate. Members of this network include the Christian, Muslim and Sikh communities—communities that are represented very highly amongst the unemployed. The Multicultural Issues Forum is another vehicle aimed at providing a voice for Calwell’s culturally diverse communities. Each forum has a distinct focus, tackling subjects as varied as transport, arts and cultural activities and problem gambling.
       </p>
       <p>
        My residents of Calwell have also recognised that in order to address the issue of unemployment a combined response from all three levels of government, businesses and the community sector is needed. As a result, earlier this year, the Employment and Learning Committee 3047 was formed to strengthen youth employment opportunities across the Broadmeadows postcode 3047 precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I launched the 3047 committee in June, most local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Services_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Job Services Australia
        </a>
        agencies, together with Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and Centrelink representatives, Hume council’s neighbourhood renewal officers and the Spectrum Education and Training Centre, had signed up and become members. In partnership with other support agencies, the 3047 committee has recently instigated three local employment projects, with a call to arms challenge, as they put it, to local businesses to support and employ our young people. These three projects are Youth Jobs Front 30 in 47, Jobs on the Go and Change Ur Reflection.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 3047 committee has been very proactive with the launch of the Youth Jobs Front 30 in 47 jobs campaign. Recently they opened a campaign shop at the Broadmeadows train station and bus interchange to encourage passers by and residents to participate. The campaign will run until 7 December with the target of placing 30 local people aged between 16 and 24 years into jobs within 47 days, hence the ‘30 47’ postcode figure used in the title. I am told by the chair of the project, Maria Langwell, that several jobs have already been found. Ms Langwell is confident that this is just the beginning and that these projects will be successful and set the example of local alliances making a difference to our young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Jobs on the Go and Change Ur Reflection campaigns are youth focused initiatives instigated by the Hume City Council. Jobs on the Go will involve the council actively door knocking employers to create jobs, while the Change Ur Reflections project is focused on a new ‘step-reversal’ approach to employment. The idea is to encourage local fast food outlets to employ young people without the need for a formal interview. While employed the young person will have a mentor to support them and after three months a pathway plan will be discussed. Big name franchises such as

        Hi-Fi are already on board.
       </p>
       <p>
        This momentum enhanced the Federal government’s move last year to appoint a Local Employment Coordinator, Mr Ian Barker, to help communities in Melbourne’s north west respond to unemployment. The role works on practical projects such as job drives and creating partnerships that bring players together.
