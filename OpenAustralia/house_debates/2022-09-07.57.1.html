        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Since June, my office has received 48 urgent inquiries from anxious constituents waiting for their passports to be processed. Some have waited several months. The government announced the recruitment of an extra 250 staff in June. How many have been recruited and when will the six-week processing time advised by the department's website be met?

         I thank the member for that very important question. I will come back to the member with the precise answer on the number of those who have been recruited and when we can expect that six-week duration to be put in place. But I would point out that the lack of support that was provided by the former government in relation to this area over the preceding nine years has led to the situation that is now facing so many Australians. It has led to the situation that so many Australians are facing right now. It's not surprising to me that you have had inquiries coming in to your office about this question, because such inquiries have been fielded by all of those on this side of the House and I suspect in the electorate offices of those opposite. What occurred under the former government in relation to this was an absolute disgrace. The Albanese government is completely committed to rectifying thisâ€”

           Mr Speaker, there was nothing in the question about the record of the previous government. On relevance, you should direct him to the terms of the question.

             With respect to those opposite, the record of the former government is precisely what has given rise to the facts of the inquiries which were referred to in the question that was asked by the honourable member to me. The Albanese government is completely committed to rectifying the problems which have been given rise to by the performance of the former government. We will be doing everything we can to get that, and I will return to the honourable member with the details that she's requested.
