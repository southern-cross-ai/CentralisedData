       <p>
        It's extremely concerning that the Labor government has decided to cut $350 million from the Community Development Grants Program. The new government must commit to continuing the Building Better Regions Fund. If it does not, these two moves would have very negative consequences for the plans for major projects in the electorate of Herbert. The Community Development Grants Program has been critical in helping to build two of the most important initiatives in Townsville, which have been well received throughout my electorate but also around the country. The first is the Cowboys Community, Training and High Performance Centre. It's really good to have the Minister for Sport here, because I expect the minister would support projects like the Cowboys Community, Training and High Performance Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's already built, Minister. You should come to Townsville, because it's already built. It's clear that the sports minister hasn't visited Townsville yet, but I'm sure the minister will visit soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second is DriveIt, a driver education and motorsports complex, which includes heavy-vehicle rollover recovery training, emergency services training, advanced driver training and 2.75 kilometres of racing circuit. These two projects have delivered more than $100 million in economic benefit for Townsville.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the last election, the coalition made three further commitments that would have been funded through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDG" rel="nofollow">
         CDG
        </a>
        Progra The result in the electorate of Herbert demonstrates the support for these projects, and I'm encouraging the new government to pick up these projects and announce them in their budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first is lighting for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverway_Stadium" rel="nofollow">
         Riverway Stadium
        </a>
        of a standard high enough for broadcasting. This would attract regular elite national cricket and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        games to Townsville. For far too long we've seen these games and matches played in either Mackay or Cairns. We have the world-class facilities in Townsville and we would like to see them played in Townsville. This would be a significant boost to the participation level, as well as having great economic value to our city. We know that the Gabba is going to be closed for redevelopment for 2032, so getting lighting at Riverway Stadium would be of benefit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, on the grassroots club level, Jabiru Park in Condon desperately needs funding for lighting for its baseball diamonds. The project would see both diamonds at Townsville's only baseball fields lit up. That would allow night fixtures as well as evening training. We have a high number of people that get skin cancers in the north, so this would allow our young children who play these games to get out of the sun.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I mention funding for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEIOU" rel="nofollow">
         AEIOU
        </a>
        Foundation, which is a facility for early intervention for children with autism. It's a very significant thing for Townsville and I'd like to see the government fund it.
