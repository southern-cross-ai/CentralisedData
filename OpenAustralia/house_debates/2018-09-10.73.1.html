        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that just last week the government's entire infrastructure plan was leaked on Monday; its plan to end conflict with Catholic schools was leaked on Tuesday; its latest corporate tax plan was leaked on Wednesday; and all week there was leaking about the Prime Minister plotting to tear down
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        ? Is this what the Prime Minister meant when he said his own government was a muppet show?

         As I said, the curtain is down on that performance, but the long-running performance of the muppet show on that side of the House is setting new records. We don't hold a candle when it comes to their performance. It's the longest-running show in the history of the Australian parliament on that side of the House. In terms of the issues raised by the member, yes, I can confirm that we have a policy and we have a plan that we're implementing to ensure that we've got congestion-busting infrastructure going all over our cities. I can confirm that as a government we've not only moved on delivering needs-based education funding, but we are making great progress in ensuring that there is absolute certainty that every parent who wants the choice to send their children to an independent school, like I do—I send them there because it reflects my faith, and that's great; I think it's wonderful—will have that choice. Whether it's a Catholic school or an independent school or anything else, I want them to have that choice, and we will make sure that they have that choice, just like we will ensure that when it comes to religious freedoms they will be protected in this country under my government.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can confirm that we will be moving to ensure that we reduce the tax burden even further on small- and medium-sized businesses, and I can confirm that the Labor Party will increase that burden on small- and medium-sized businesses. Remember how the member for Batman said, 'Tax is a privilege'? No—when it's weighing down on a business or on a low-income earner, it's a burden. It's a burden that removes their hope and takes them away from the choices that they want to make. My government will deliver the strong economic growth that Australians need to make the choices they want, whether it's congestion busting in our cities that means they can move around, see their families, get to work and get on with their lives—we support Australians living the life of their choice and we will enable their choices.
