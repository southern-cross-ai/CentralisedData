       <p>
        I rise to talk about the coalition's deregulation agenda. I am incredibly proud to be part of a government that recognises that the great creator of wealth, prosperity and employment in our nation is not the government; it is the private sector. The best thing that we can do as a nation is to do everything in our power to get out of the way of the private sector, to remove the regulations and the red tape that businesses in my electorate spend hours and hours, days and days, weeks and weeks complying with, employing more staff to deal with red tape rather than finding further sales.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it is interesting that, when we introduced what has been termed the biggest bonfire of regulation repeal in this country into the parliament, I sat in the chamber and I looked across the divide at my Labor colleagues, and they squirmed and they yelled and they screamed because they just do not believe, in their own
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">

        , that it is the private sector that creates jobs and it is the private sector that creates wealth and prosperity in this nation. They really do believe that there is no problem in this country that can be fixed until a bureaucrat or a politician in Canberra has had a look at it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to use this opportunity to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister,

        , for leading the charge. He came to my electorate. He listened to locals. We have repealed red tape that was making it harder for businesses in my electorate. Ultimately that means that government will get out of the way, and we will have greater employment for locals in my community.
