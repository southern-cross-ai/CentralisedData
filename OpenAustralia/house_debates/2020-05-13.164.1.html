       <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has hit all our communities in different ways, and today I would like to take some time to discuss the experience in my community in Bennelong. I think it is very important in a time like this that local stories are not subsumed by the big stories sweeping the world. I have been heartbroken by the damage the pandemic has done to my community but I am heartened and proud of the way the community has responded to these unprecedented challenges.
       </p>
       <p>
        As many will remember, one of the first and cruellest outbreaks of the virus occurred in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Park
        </a>
        at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge. In early March the first positive test result was returned for a worker at the lodge. It was the first case of untraced community transmission in Australia. This was a terrifying prospect. In the following weeks, tragically, more residents succumbed to the virus. In total, six residents of the community lost their lives. This is a terrible and appalling loss of life and, to the families of those residents who have passed away, I offer my sincere condolences.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fortunately, we are blessed with wonderful healthcare workers, who rose to the challenge. The staff at the lodge did their utmost to curb the transmission of the virus and manage existing cases. Their vigilance and effort are reflected in the fact cases soon began to decline. I'm proud to inform the House that, as of 1 May, Dorothy Henderson Lodge has been free of coronavirus.
       </p>

        Despite this, it must be remembered that our broader community has felt some of the worst effects of the pandemic. In total, Ryde has experienced some 66 cases, one of the biggest counts in the country. Although we have now seen the number of active cases slowly decline, we cannot grow complacent. There is always the looming prospect of a second wave, which may do far more damage than the first. After all, the vast majority of the deaths that occurred during the Spanish flu last century occurred after the first wave had passed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite these gloomy prospects, I take hope in the small acts of kindness, bravery and generosity which have populated the last few months. Seeing the work some of our community organisations do to help our most marginalised during this particularly challenging period has reminded me of the strong bonds which link us together. I would like to acknowledge the admirable efforts of everybody, from our nurses to our charities to everyday people, for pulling together to help us get through this.
       </p>
       <p>
        A great man once asked not to be judged in victory but during the uncertainty of battle. Our judgement during this uncertain battle is that, together, we Australians have fought bloody well.
