       <p>
        It is with pleasure that I rise today to acknowledge the wonderful work of the many volunteers in the bayside suburbs of my electorate of Bonner. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to those who so tirelessly assist the Wynnum and Districts Chamber of Commerce and the Manly Chamber of Commerce.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Wynnum and Districts Chamber of Commerce was established in 1951 and, as the chamber itself states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From humble beginnings the Chamber is now a fully-fledged service provider to the business community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe this should read that the chamber is ‘an invaluable provider to and supporter of the business community’. The chamber is ably represented by its general manager, Pete Baines, and its president, Phil Saunders. Pete is an incredibly hardworking individual who has been committed for so many years to ensuring that business in the area has a voice and is supported. Phil, as a local business owner, knows what it takes to make a small business successful and is taking the lead in the chamber to assist other businesses to thrive. All the chamber’s functions are inevitably extremely well facilitated by

        and his wife, Di. They are community leaders and have always tirelessly volunteered their time in support of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Acknowledgement is also due to

        , the President of the Manly Chamber of Commerce, and to Floranel Budziosz. David makes an incredible contribution to the community, and I thank him for all he has done for business and tourism in the Manly precinct. Floranel is also an integral member of both the Manly Chamber of Commerce secretariat and the Wynnum Manly Tourism and

        </a>
        . She is recognised as a tireless and wonderful contributor to her local community. In my experience, Floranel is an all-round lovely person. I know that the chamber is particularly grateful to Floranel for all her efforts and that each year she exceeds the chamber’s expectations. The chamber certainly believes that she deserves the thanks of every trader and property owner in her area as well as the thanks of the whole Manly community. I join them in those thanks.
       </p>
       <p>
        All these people contribute so much to their local community, and it is only fitting that they receive acknowledgement. I know that my thanks are shared by all those that they assist.
