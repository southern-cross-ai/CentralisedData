        The weekend's election result in Victoria has, again, many lessons for the centre-right side of Australian politics. While there is an argument that both major parties are losing their appeal at the ballot box, we have work to do in demonstrating to all Australians of all ages and backgrounds that we understand their needs and priorities. The standout result on Saturday night was secured by my friend Sam Groth. Before politics, Sam was a professional tennis player, and his spectacular sporting career gave him discipline, determination and endurance, which are a marvel to behold. He then joined the Australian media as a commentator and host of

        , celebrating Victorian destinations, including the magical

        , where he now resides with his beautiful wife, Britt, and their two delicious and hilarious twin boys, Mason and Parker.

        Like so many of our fellow Victorians, Sam struggled with the Andrews government's approach to the pandemic, watching small businesses do it tough across Victoria, especially at home, where we found ourselves included in metro-Melbourne lockdowns despite our vast open spaces and low-density population. Sam reached out to the Liberal Party during the pandemic, and the rest is history. Over the last year, Sam has worked tirelessly in his pursuit to represent the people of Nepean, from

        , across to Merricks and down to the tip of Point Nepean National Park. He has been a ferocious advocate for infrastructure and health improvements, gaining commitments from a future Liberal government to $340 million for the Rosebud Hospital and $175 million for the completion of the
