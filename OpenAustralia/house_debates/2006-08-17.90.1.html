        Last weekend the authentic replica of the Dutch vessel
        <i>
         Duyfken
        </i>
        dropped anchor in Gladstone. It was moored at the O’Connell Wharf, giving thousands of people a rare opportunity of experiencing a working 16th century vessel. As always, Gladstone carried out the ceremonies with commendable aplomb. The mayor, Peter Corones, and the Indigenous elders were there. We had a particularly fine function on the jetty and then inspected the
        <i>
         Duyfken
        </i>
        , which is on a 16,000 kilometre voyage from

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York" rel="nofollow">
         Cape York
        </a>
        to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the
        <i>
         Duyfken
        </i>
        ’s passage through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government has provided almost half a million dollars towards the cost of the journey, which is the centrepiece of the government’s 2006 focus on coastal and maritime heritage. As I said, the
        <i>
         Duyfken
        </i>
        started its journey in Western Australia—in fact, from Fremantle—on 6 April, and it will end its journey after visiting 25 ports. The ship was to have visited Bundaberg also, but was prevented by high winds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gladstone was a very appropriate place to take this vessel because it is a rich centrepiece of Australian maritime history—it played a seminal part during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . It is the focus of the Brisbane to Gladstone yacht race, Australia’s second biggest race. It is now a major port—the fastest growing port in Australia—exporting 12 per cent of Australia’s materials by volume. So for that reason it was quite appropriate. It is said that some
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_and_Portuguese" rel="nofollow">
         Spanish and Portuguese
        </a>
        coins were found on a headland at Gladstone and it is speculated that one of the ships in the Quiros or Torres fleet may well have come down the east coast of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gladstone is about to construct a maritime museum and I have been at the forefront in trying to have
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Gladstone
        </i>
        , which is shortly to be decommissioned, transferred to Gladstone. It is a Fremantle class patrol boat and, as honourable members know, they are shortly to be replaced by the Armadale class. It was commissioned in 1984, and I urge the government in its allocation of this vessel to give the highest priority to Gladstone. As I said, it is a city that does things well. It will be well displayed and it will become the centrepiece of a fine maritime museum in
