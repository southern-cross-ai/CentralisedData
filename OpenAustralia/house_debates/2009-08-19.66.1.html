         I thank the member for Forde, who has a particular interest in health reform. We recently visited Logan Hospital together where millions of dollars of investment are going into a new emergency department. I know he takes an interest in these issues. As part of the health reform commission’s report, to date six consultations have been undertaken by the Prime Minister and me, and several more are coming in the following weeks. In fact, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ageing are visiting

         covers some comments about the shadow health spokesperson. You might have thought this would aid our discussion on Monday about health reform, that it might have been about health debates, about health policy or about health investments. But, in fact, it is an article called ‘Parachutes ready’ by Sue Lappeman and it is about how the Liberal Party is ensuring that the member for Dickson, the shadow health spokesperson, can be parachuted into the seat of

The member for Dickson’s seat is not within her responsibility. She has no right to be answering a question about matters outside her ministerial responsibility.

               Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. At the risk of upsetting your applecart and pressing your good graces to the opposition, the minister is being intensely provocative and that is why the member for Fadden rose and took his point of order. She is not answering a question within her ministerial responsibility. Obviously she feels intimidated by the shadow health minister.

At the 20th question, I invite the minister to respond to the question.

                  I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw your attention to standing orders under the subheading of ‘Disorder’, specifically standing order 90, ‘Reflections on members’:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  All imputations of improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I invite you to apply the one-hour rule to the very disorderly minister.

                        The point of order goes to whether the question was in order at the time. My consideration of the question was that it was in order. There is only one standing order that applies to the question and that is the matter of relevance. As I have discussed here before, this House has developed a very broad definition of relevance. I invite the minister to use the material that she has in response to the question and draw her answer to a conclusion.
